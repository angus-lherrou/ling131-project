what I hate I hate being called a hater I been called a heater a number of times usually in the context of being a Christian\nGoes oh you're a Christian so you have all women who had abortions homosexuals alcoholics and so\nWell I Am very very pro life or if you will\nIt goes oh you're a Christian so you hate all women who have had abortions homosexuals alcoholics and so on\nWell I Am very very pro life or if you will anti abortion but I don't hate anyone including people who perform abortions or who have had one yet some people who don't even know me I've decided that I hate certain people\nI think lesions that there are people who do have those who disagree with them and they logical is incorrectly assume that if they hate people they disagree with then everyone does\nWell today the big focus on hate is our commander in chief and those who supported as we're seeing today hate will often morph into violence all of the politically related violence that I've seen in our nation in the past couple of years comes from those on the political far left\nThe specifically includes antifa or ... or what is your column or a classic example is a fascist Nazis but we see people who are active in politics or elected officials or even people who just wear a garment with the conservative political symbol or message they're being attacked so far most of the attacks have been verbal but some of the physical\nThese hate motivated attacks on people are totally contrary to the way of life in a constitutional republic like ours and then we have members of Congress with other leaders openly advocating violence against their opponents including the president worse they go on condemned by anyone including the media\nThis open rejection of our constitution\nDisagreement is not only okay he's at least a rational discussion that can lead to a positive change we don't want everyone to think the same way this is the culture of socialist fascism communist societies yet it's sure appears that this is the path our nation is on the haters anyway\nI have defended with my life the right of our citizens to peacefully protest against things they disagree with what that does not include screaming in the face of a legislator\nDisrupting government meetings are blocking access to village\nI guess it does include rushing like an idiot and parading around\nBut do you note that when those groups do have their gatherings are parades they leave tons of trash behind\nPicking up after themselves seems to be beneath them in our country doesn't need this attitude as a part of our culture\nNotes that the mainstream media seems to support this hateful approach towards our president\nHe certainly is not perfect but he's already done a significant number of very positive things including a vastly improved economy with the company lowest unemployment rates and Lois number of people on welfare decades\nHis foreign policies just returning respect ordination hey look at ambassador Nikki Haley in the un look at Korea look at Israel and now we're dealing with China and Russia and Iran from a position of strength yet he's still hate that\nPresident Trump is to address the family Research Council a Christian group they believe that homosexual is and so some have called them a hate group and they're putting Trump down for speaking to a hate group\nHuh and look at justice cabinet he received death threats is home was vandalized and his family threatened and he's not the only one people attack like this are hostile to our constitution what they want is for all of us to think and speak only what they approve\nMy greatest fear is that's a clear if unstated goal of the radical far left is to overthrow our constitution they're attacking our president with a goal of getting them removed and a constitutional republic the way one deals with an unlike elected official is working to get him or her replaced in the next election not violence like we see today\nViolence is the exact way Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party took over the parliamentary democracy of Germany prior to World War two\nWe have to stop the hate filled comments and return to intelligent dialogue we don't have to agree with each other and everything I don't think that's possible anyway we do have to take the hate out of the communication I pray for him\nDialogue we don't have to agree with each other and everything I don't think that's possible anyway we do have to take the hate out of the communication I pray for hate filled people hating hurts the life of the hate are much more than it hurts the target of the hate\nThe political hate also hurts our nation our kids just might grow up thinking there's such behavior is acceptable troops with someone get through to hate talk just end it\nLeave it was necessary because there is talk of violence suggested is illegal and anti freedom and your plan to call the police what happens we have to take our nation back from the haters\nBut we still have a constitutional republic and those are my comments were today this is going to let it go and you're listening to the front lines of freedom now we got to enjoy some more wisdom was one officer all ... what do you have to they roll\nWell colonel were in the thick of the political season with midterm elections just around the corner however the department of defense so strict rules about how members of the U.S military can participate in politics so what do these rules cover\nThe department of defense encourages active duty members to vote in established several programs to help active duty personnel register and cast absentee ballots but when it comes to actively\nCampaigning for a specific political candidate the military draws the line it should be noted that these prohibitions do not apply to members of the national guard and reserve unless of course are currently serving on active duty\nNow active duty military members can and should vote they also may express it personal opinion on political candidates in issues they just can't express those opinions as a representative of the department of defense or the military\nActive duty members can sign a petition for specific legislative action or a petition to place the candidates name and an official election ballot they can also write a letter to the editor expressing their personal views on public is used for political candidates however if the letter Dennis ... is the member as a member of the military\nIt must clearly stated that the views are expressed are those are the individual and not the department of defense now here's one I thought was kind of interesting colonel maybe you solve this when you are on active duty a political bumper sticker can be put on a military members personal vehicle however large banners are signs are not allowed to\nWhat this means isn't a yard sign in a military members home is actually\nAgainst the rules according to the department of defense military members can still attend rallies fundraising activities and all the other things that we would do as a normal citizen as long as they're not in uniform and not creating the appearance of any military sponsorship or approval but here's an interesting one\nMilitary members cannot speak before a partisan political gathering including any gathering that promotes a partisan political party candidate or cause\nIn general active duty military members should avoid any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associated in the department of defense or the department of homeland security with a partisan political activity\nMakes us no active duty military members males will not hold any civil office and the federal government requires an appointment by the president\nThis prohibition does not apply to retire to reserve members\nHowever if they'd been called active duty for more than two hundred and Seventy days they actually have to get approval from the secretary of their service to allow them to retain their public office or even run for reelection so just imagine that congressman who's a reserve is who gets recalled active duty to go and let's say Afghanistan for a year\nHe actually has to have the service secretary approved him to keep his office kind of an interesting perspective isn't it it is a deep well bottom line folks is the military members should get out and vote but for the most part they should shy away from getting involved in in political race\nIt is a deep well bottom line folks who is the military members should get out and vote but for the most part they should shy away from getting involved in in political race until after they've left the military yes we have some reserve members were also politicians but\nWe don't have any active duty service members who are currently politicians and you know what I think that makes a lot of sense it does civilian control of the military to use the right answer\nThank you rolling very appropriate very timely I appreciate your pal\nStraight ahead on front lines of freedom will review some lessons we should have learned from the Holocaust than David Barton will discuss the importance of next month's elections all this is coming up\nI'm going to give them your telephone lines of read them I'll be right back groups has time for countries let's do fifty standard these\nWe need to talk on the bill ... seven five and twelve sixty WC age the\nBase and it's hard for honor and remember as a national partner with honor and remember our national deeply committed to never forgetting those he paid the ultimate price in service to our country\nThis happened and this did happen to my father bore witness to it and\nI and just to let people know not only about the Holocaust and the fact that it did happen and it was a witness but\nWhat it was like for the soldiers to leave home but to go through this incredible experience that and then to come home and so I just wanted to tell the story is not just of the battles are not just of the generals and the officers but of the soldier what it was like for the common American soldier during World War two\nI did a good job of that this is colonel due to human front lines of freedom we're discussing the Holocaust with all sorts jak Sacco jak I'm sure listeners are going to want to see how can they get a copy I guess Amazon that kind of things\nYeah Amazon they have copies and Israel before Kendall and I have a website can get it if they want it autographed or anything like that I'd be happy to do that jak shackled dot com is the name of the website and they they can get one directly from me or they can like you say go to Amazon are pretty much any book store you get a\nBill I recommend you do it's just take a minute now in some up some of the key point you'd like us all to take from our conversation ... ...\nWell I think the main point is that I Want people to understand what the American Soldiers have met with the American military has met to this country these are some of the greatest people\nWho have been in this country has been the American military in the end what they have done a ... a and sacrifice in the world war two they you know these guys came out of the depression they went off they save the world and I want people to really understand it I\nThink they might get a feel for that they read the book these guys save the world and you know what they were up against the world would be completely different and unrecognizable as these young men\nWho were teachers and farm workers and and you know have gone off left the homes that they lived and traveled to a distant land to fight really for people they did not do they not only fought for the people there they fought for our nation and our freedoms and our way of life\nAnd they came back and they built this country and and it showed that phrase of the greatest generation I Want people to not only a realized how true that is but I Want them to get to know a few of these guys personally because I think it\nNot only it's not just about my father it's about all of them and I I Know that\nA lot of people can relate and and another another thing that I could add quickly is that a lot of the world war two soldiers didn't talk about it when they came home so I get a lot of information a lot of the emails and people telling me she and my\nGrandfather was in World War two of my father was there my uncle or whatever and they never talk about it yeah and I knew that they had gone through a lot of things in this book allows people to see what their fathers grandfathers\nA or a you know family members or what the American Soldiers went through and what they do the emotions that they style and how strong they were and how victorious they were these were the heroes and they used with a liberator and these are the guys that saved our our nation\nI couldn't agree more with the with my father in law falls into that same category jak thank you for taking time to join us today thank you for helping us to remember and learn\nAbout the greatest generation in this

Charlottesville [noise]\nMedia minutes with our current CNN\nIs it a war of wars with President Trump in the wake of the attempted pipe bomb attacks that targeted the cable news network and of course leading Democrats at a rally the president called on those in the political arena to tone things down but he also said the media have a responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility on constant negative but oftentimes false attacks\nCNN president Jeff Zucker saying the White House doesn't understand the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media scene as Chris Cuomo said they just send a bomb to CNN the president doesn't say a word about that and then tells us we are to blame\nPresident responding on Twitter yesterday big part of the anger in society caused

me\nDavid I knew you grew up in the Christian family where did your interest in government come from a wasn't a family\nNow button brother when I grew up there were several things I hate it state as far away from so I could add law district government politics or for the for the state of saw away from and now those are the areas in which I'm most gauge must Becca it's been a real transformation from the way I grew up to what I'm doing now\nOkay what attracted you and what not to some of the things you've done\nWell one of the things that attracted me was I kept seeing goofy stuff going on at my local city council is a great example of just walk with that but I'm from a little town we have two hundred twenty people I wrote my horse back and forth to work for a very laid back and yet we ended up in our little town with six lawsuits against the town too by the federal government we had an ...\nA hundred and fifty thousand dollar debt but should we had ... is just crazy and I looked at that said you gotta be kidding that we can do better than that and so I really started working with groups in town to get better candidates and that's where I recognize that quality government is no better than the leaders you elect and that if you don't pay attention to it\nThe few people turn out and vote will elect leaders as it turns out only two percent of most cities actually choose the winters there lectures\nSo it's very few people that if you look at the city of Houston to great example not sufficient to far just sit in the nation Houston by itself is larger than twenty six states population wise and generally four percent of the city of Houston chooses their mayor which is the equivalent to the governor twenty states\nAnd only two percent of that four percent of what it takes to choose the winter\nSo essentially two percent of Houston's population chooses the equivalent of a gal her twenty six states and I'll look to them so there's no way I can sit by and let crazy things happen when two percent of ... in the winter and so that's where I got very actively involved not only in recruiting candidates but how the candidates Ron\nI held a political office in Texas for nine

was telling me because we are Christians and Muslims consider us infidels and they want to kill us\nSo I learned since I was it ten year old little girl that I Am wanted dead simply because I was born

domestic threat to our nation by radical Islam this is not theoretical this is going on today we need to be aware of it\nTalk to us about what we as citizens as parents\nNeed to be making are huge in our communities aware of and this is not to hate Muslims but it's to be aware of threats am I right\nAbsolutely oh we need to be aware of threats and being aware of threats has nothing to do with hating people look when you have a security system in your home whether eighty or any other place not because you hate your neighbors because you'll know that unless you lock your doors at night\nThere may be some that dog with what happened to drive in front of your neighborhood and who may come into your property and break your door and he just wants to protect yourself if you're not saying my neighbors are dogs they're not saying I'm going to lock my door because I had to you all my neighbor down my enemy you're not doing it for your neighbors\nYou know doing it for the fact that they're the possibility that that people can wander into your neighborhood and break into your home I think the church and all the time and I ask about that I could do you like your turn to the night and of course they look at me like of course it like ... and I said well if you want all refugees will come to America you want us to have open borders we need to welcome everybody\nBecause everybody

don't keep them up and so any\nHomeless people from the sleeping the churches that condition it's heated that's got to get ten you've got plenty of basic of threats on the computer use them at that and then your church\nAnd they don't have an answer for that because they know that what I'm saying the truth and it is and so this is why we have to protect ourselves but another chapter in my book

minority majority in our country\nCannot even discuss what they're going in the classroom as a matter of fact do they use them in Christianity I barely mentioned and the best books ... looks out for example there's a book called the ... century\nThe pages of the book I dedicated to slump Christianity has two pages and that is not right and so I Do what's happening in the public schools and why parents need to be engaged and involved\nIn every chapter of the book at the end of the chapter I have a section titled rise up and to act more I guess people tips ideas as to what they can do to make a difference for the country\nAnd the chapter on operation indoctrination isn't particularly important because it deals with the future generations and what they are taught about our country\nOr the ... truth the lightest and we owe our children to teach them the truth so this book is a must read to everybody concerned that book is titled dries it is available in all book stores nationwide as

and nightclub according\nTo the sun ... a publication and in the u._k. get outta here yeah Barry Church one of the starting safety's allegedly one of the guys\nAnd they're already down three quarterbacks\nAs well and so Barry churches earning safety and uh it's Romney Harrison is the rookie safety who's been playing nickel so he might not I don't know if these guys are in a player and I guess that they might who knows that they were actually arrested but this is the word going around the camp\nBeen playing nickel so he might not I don't know if these guys are unemployed I my guess that they might\nWho knows if they were actually arrested but this is the word going around the campfire oh yeah here it is and uh I'll tell you what if they end up not playing it makes a metric that's already a little bit easier for Carson what's even more you don't get arrested Dave I've never gotten arrested as long as you know\nAnd neither have I of course I don't know that long but yeah I we don't approve of it than Americans going out there come on represent the country better buried church already\nFive five to one to four to two sevens the phone number eight five five to one to four CBS\nI got a fun night for you here getting you ready for we gate and Dave let's look at some of the injuries and the running backs that we were concerned about on Tuesday when we were making our waiver claims Sean McCoy not free to Chris Thomson Reuters Freeman Peyton Barber bar the Mac summer in summer out\nWho's in this week well we've already got one by one\nIt was I think that's the best way to do it because it through a lot of names\nLike the first one I'm going to spout off on his Chris tops and an even I'm not sure if he'll be the guy I'll start with Chris ...\nName after all right good times and he he's probably gonna play probably going to play but I don't know how much is going to play because this is a great measure for Adrian Peterson against the giants\nGiants already ranked twentieth and fantasy points allowed to running backs okay just the running backs twentieth out of thirty two teams that's not great and they just treated weather best run defender and ... and he's off to Detroit you might not even play for the lines this week but the giants definitely won't have him it makes that match up even sweeter\nFor Adrian Peterson I'm thinking twenty carries for eighty over a hundred yards and the touchdown that means not a lot left for Chris Thompson and that would be just fine for Washington because they don't want him to get hurt any further than he already is\nAnd they will also the giants will also be without their top linebacker alec Ogletree so even more good news for Adrian Peterson the Sean McCoy do you think he's going to play\nSo he's been limited to practice for most of the week but he's still in the concussion protocol he needs to be cleared out of it before he can play that game is Monday not tomorrow\nSo you just need to keep tabs on on his situation maybe we'll learn before kickoff tomorrow\nWhether an idle players the other problem he's playing the patriots so it's not exactly a great to have a great run nice and I think they do I think they're on defense is a little bit better than than than you might think I Know that Jordan Howard scored on the last week but he was held to a terrible rushing average to recall and\nHad to do a lot of his damage catching passes out of the backfield\nAnd maybe it'll show I'm a court can do that but McCoy I don't think he's got a game this year with over ten fantasy points so I'm not excited to start him I think he's a flex if he's healthy on Monday Night against knowing\nWhat are you excited about where he most or does not look like math breed is going to play\nYes I Am excited about him because we've seen now for two games that when he has played he's had an outstanding rushing average he's shown some explosive missed and he's made a bunch of big place and I think it's gone\nI I don't know fantasy owners have necessarily seen it go under the radar but those big plays have he's averaging six point three yards to carry on the season over seven years for Kerry\nIn his last two games he will split carries without for Morris so more that the goal line will probably be there but if they're trailing against Arizona if they're in a back and forth game\nJane I'm

B.\n\n\n[noise] Hi on\nCBS is really [noise]\nWell you don't expect it it's all see it if I mean myself playing right now\nNow is that the ... version or is that the slick Rick version that proceeded to oh I was not even aware of that oh that's because you're young yeah you're not going to go around and look Rick when he came up with the grid veterans like right now this is definitely montel though I can tell you that he thinks about\nFriday night at a Saturday Night and we are back here on fantasy football taking your phone calls at eight five five to one to\nFour to two seven eight five five to one to four CBS uh during the break I asked Dave hey can you give me to start that each position a physician real quick and he'd never responded so I'm going to be a good\nFriend and a good co host and just just throw them into the fire they can you give me two starts at each position real quick with\nPleasure let's start a quarterback where you know all the studies that are out there I'm not going to waste your time with her Rogers and Patrick ... homes\nBut I Am going to waste your time with Michel ... who has three straight games with over three hundred yards and at least three touchdowns in each he has achieved must start status and I think Andy Dalton going up against Tampa Bay loving outstanding game the bucks give out a slew of as he points to opposing quarterbacks\nAdult in the home in a get right spot it there is no exception where he talked a little bit about Philip Lindsey but now that he's the main running back there is no Roy screaming I noticed about they Booker will have a role but I didn't feel blends who's going to see a career high and carries yards catches receiving yards he's going to have\nA monster day I think everybody should get him\nLocked and loaded into fantasy lettuce and I think people should do the same with Chris Carson I Know he disappointed in his last game it was against the raiders he should have had a monster game he only play three quarters in the game and the fourth quarter told garbage on that's why we're shot penny\nHad the work that he did so I Would go right back to to Chris Carson at wide receiver I'm I'm going to keep writing the Bengals Tyler Boyd the number two wide receiver they're going to play in the ... a lot against Tampa Bay he should be able to score this week and I think John Brown does\nI'm going to keep writing the Bengals Tyler Boyd the number two wide receiver they're going to play in the ... a lot against Tampa Bay he should be able to score this week and I think John Brown does the same thing and because I'm such a nice guy I'm going to give you another wide receiver drawn to miles and expected to make his return for Green Bay\nAgainst the ramp should be a high scoring game and I think Aaron Rodgers likes what he's gotten a drama house and I think he's happy to have him back tight end even a joke who's been hot you're going to keep writing him\nOJ how it's been great to win there hasn't been quite as many headlines about OJ Howard but he continues to get decent guarded and he can find the end zone and you know James when some links to lean on his tight end\nAnd Jared Cook I think it's going to be the biggest benefactor of the uh Oakland Raiders with a mark Cooper no longer on the team Cooper's gone targets are going to get spread out to everybody but I think jerk cook will see a lot more and it's not a bad match against Indianapolis starting safety or banged up\nAlright and listen people if you listen to our podcast you know I've already said this we've already said that surround them all Allison is under own Dave just call them sneaky start he's Seventy one percent or to CBS Sports dot com exist on a low ownership percentage but I think it needs to go up there is no chance she'd be a\nFree agent in any of my leagues I pick them up uh he's had any let something like sixty four to eighty yards in all four of his games two touchdowns in\nFour games he's talented he did a great all fence and uh I think you're going to regret it if you leave him on own so please pick up drawn out and I've got a couple of more bold predictions I gave one about where he most dirt and his fantasy owners in our first segment I Will say my next to for our third segment right now I Want to hear from you at the at our phone number CBS Sports radio it's toll\nFree line eight five five to one to ... for two to seven is brought you buy guy go great news there is a quick way you could save money switch to a guy go go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance Greg in Houston what's up Greg you're an eye on fantasy football\nOr I was a dollar a day like Rick reference I Love it\nOh man I grew up on flickering he was he was the first um\nAlbum that I bought [laughter] 'cause you know when you're when you're a kid in my area in which you're listening to its bad uh it was so good\nAt 'em you gotta look Mona Lisa song and with\nThat [laughter] oh okay I'm In\nThat that that uh with my my child joined track okay so my question is I have a a for a number to running back at the time the people for a PR league\nAnd uh I have a yelled in Carson or a chart ... if you don't like any of those options I could take a um either Aaron Jones or I'm more or whatever then\nMost are running most or wrote him a little bit I don't know if you have to start 'em but you drive your job yelled in for Aaron Jones right now\nA hundred percent what I was about to say the jails and it's going to be limited to a passing down draw and that's not bad for the PR league like here's Greg but I think Aaron Jones says more upside the rest of the season that's what you're looking\nFor and ask you this week I think the best running back to that you should go with\nIs actually Chris Carson he doesn't catch the ball out but I like the match against Detroit even if snacks Harrison plays the the run the offense is not going to suddenly turned into a shutdown unit and the sea hawks have actually done a nice job running football they're often one is playing well they're coming off of a by I think Chris Carson as your best bet\nDylan in Pittsburgh is on eight five five to one to four to seven Dylan what's going on in\n... thing for taking my call guys I got two questions for a standard oblique her cousins were jerked often and Greg Olson or ...\nI'm going to go off of her cousins all nervous\nHer cousins were juror golfing and Greg Olson or ...\nI'm going to go off of her cousins and a little nervous about cousins\nNo game predicts shouldn't ... cousin top five\nYeah I I think you're going to be I think you're going to be off on that one I I think at the saints defense is going to play a little bit better I think the addition of Eli Apple won't change them\nInto a great unit but I think it will make them just a little bit better I'm the one thing that we didn't really talk about on the podcast is would you lie apple is being reunited with marsh on land more and von bell they were all teammates at Ohio State I think that'll help them get comfortable quicker and that defense\nAnd cousins just hasn't been able to bring the touchdowns in a lot of his games lately so I'm a little nervous about him I Would go with golf\nHigh scoring game great often said he's and he's going to do fine and I'm going to go to Iran over Olson but I'm not in love with the broader as I was earlier in the week and that's because the return of jak to oil I don't think he runs gonna lose playing time because of oil playing there but Doyle is going to take targets away from him and it kind of makes you feel like a touchdown or bus type of tight and\nI don't know if you're legally do trades and late nights on Saturdays early in the morning on Sundays but if they did I Would tell you the ... brown while his value is still fairly high\nJust for the record I Do have some questions about how much you lie apple plays in his first game he's expected to play yeah expected to play but I don't know if he's going to get the full workload is actually like I said with with daemon Harrison\nEli Apple or is also scheduled to play Seventeen games this year the machines have already had there by so easier on the defensive back yeah for a defensive lineman though and the ... yeah I Would ever I let let's say\nThese lectures doors workshop garage capital shed says your heads are busy capital should take advantage of their own twenty four and thirty six months no interest deals

[noise]\nAll right Dave let's see what you got you know this um [noise]\nDave [noise] yeah you know it yeah butterfly effect where\nDo you know who originally wrote this risk and recorded it no this is a red hot chili peppers are is\nA real yeah so like they stole it\nFrom or they they like you know they use it you know I mean like ah like Michael Jordan [noise] okay yeah interesting I thought I ... I don't know the name of the song they get from mother's milk herself there no it's from from blood sugar sex magic I don't know the name of the chili pepper song but\nUm yeah it's a it's kind of fun trivia questions so there you go\nWe're dropping music knowledge Johnny tonight and I understand that people by ... or that is Dave Richard and we're taking your calls up until midnight eastern eight five five to one to four to two seven if anybody knows the number song I'm referring to please let me know going to take a bunch of phone calls got my last full production of the night the\nFirst two were about most dirt and Kirk Cousins Dave ... number three Aaron Jones eighty yards and a touchdown and what's the basis of that production Adam\nIt's time to time teams have to have to get smart during their by a week\nThey need to run the ball more I thought that they were so dumb against the forty niners they're running the ball effectively\nWith both of their guys they went away from it inexcusable that not that that that was one of them is not getting double digit carry its time Jones is the better back he had he had just carry on Johnson moment and I think he I think he's got a chance to be a reliable start arrests season\nI think he has a chance once he gets the opportunity or Mike mccarthy spent time this week talking about how they do want to get the Runyon going but he didn't ...\nBe a reliable start arrests season I think he has a chance once he gets the opportunity a Mike mccarthy spent time this week talking about how they do want to get the Runyon going but he didn't mention any running backs specifically getting that opportunity so it it's that's one of those things where I I Hope you're right but I Want to see it before I buy into it in my fantasy\nLand totally fair\nOr one other thing I Want to see this week is I Want to see another good game from doubled when I Want to believe that he is a must start wide receiver that I drafted him to be and he's coming off a good game before his by week\nYou know I'm willing to give them an excuse for the first six weeks of the season with the injuries and whatnot but and I you know that's the guy that I had very high hopes for understandably has been one of the most consistently\nLower number one wide receivers and fantasy I'm ready for Baldwin to get back to that and that's one of my bold predictions is that the ball when does exactly that this week it's got a great opportunity to do it against the lions I did have a little bird he told me this week that he's just not going to be at a hundred percent all season long but\nAfter the blowout game in London which he looked pretty good and then after a week off\nHis knees are going to be about as good as they possibly will be\nThe lines of struggle against slot wide receiver so I think this is a great way to sort of me as a top twenty wide receiver\nDo it All right a five five to one to four to seven let's get as many calls as we can during the second only got about ten eleven minutes to get to your calls let's take a lot of them that we as many calls as we want carries for Aaron Jones like Fifteen or sixteen Dan in Long Island what's up\nSo that I'm a native New Yorker and you don't know slick Rick I'm very [laughter] alright digress hello hello they've hello hello Dan\nI got a trade that's ripping my legal part and that doesn't help that I'm the commissioner I'd be giving up in a ... a ... and Big Bend and getting Cam Newton levy on bill and OJ Howard is it really that lopsided that there should be an uproar over this\nWell I Would say on the scale of the trade o meter scale where one is perfectly fine and ten is out of control then I'm going to give you annoying I I think that this is really lopsided and they can die in Robbins burger\nIt's about even maybe it's about in between those who I'd say can maybe it's a little bit of an edge\nBut for now we're slipping on bell I mean I Know that we don't know when let me on bell will come back but let her for net when he does come back we'll not be the every down back for the Jacksonville Jaguars might lead them and carries a Carl sides going to have a role and they're not going to let TJ yelled and language on the bench you will see some third down work and you're getting OJ Howard as well\nSo Dan I I'm Sorry I think you're you're kind of ... and the other team\nThat I think it's like a six I don't think it's that bad and and I think it has to go through it's not a veto of\nAll what uh five through one Tyler rocket that have been better not really I think you've got to do better than lock in a ...\nI don't think that you're obligated to make a trade that's perfectly fair that the one on the trend amateur that they've just debuted right away [laughter] I don't think you're obligated to do that this look this is a bad trade and you're clear I\nThink you're clearly winning it but I see a scenario where you aren't you know it's not it's not ridiculous so I don't I just these types of traits happen they're not veto Abul ... I'm Sorry to the rest of your Li like you're winning the straight and and that's that\nBut I think Dan's doing the right thing he's the commissioner of the league care to be impartial or unfair he doesn't want to rule with an iron fist he's opening it up to the rest of your league\nI think the best thing for you to do Dan is put it to a vote let everybody sleep on it tonight tomorrow before twelve o'clock eastern time everybody should have to cast a vote on whether or not the traits barren out and if the majority rules\nIf it's in your favorite greatest not you gotta make it better trade\nFive five to one to four to seven\nOr not and if the majority rules if it's in your favorite greatest not you got to make a better trade\nWimps eight five five to one to four to seven Korean Pennsylvania what's up Cory\nHey I have a um start to question for Chris guy we're color Gabriel ...\nI'm going to sit trade one and I know that a couple of weeks ago he had an amazing game that was the Drew Brees record breaker game uh but I'm not ready to buy into him as a as a reliable starter or even in a match up where the Vikings that past events might not having savior rose I'm not expecting roads to play\nDoes not matter I don't think that he's a good start here I'd rather go with Gabriel and God Bless\nYou rank guide went ahead of Gabriel I Do okay uh eight five five to one to four to two seven Benjamin in Pittsburgh Benjamin you're an eye on fantasy football\nThey get ... ah first off just want to say condolences for the city of Pittsburgh yeah horrible horrible shooting 'em so next uh I have a trade that I Wonder maybe pulled the trigger on your soil which is\nThought I'd Michael Thomas in under five hundred and ... it's a ... point and also you get a point per completion for a quarterback so the guy off all on the show a carry on John So we're in the\nAnd also lock 'em for Michael Thomas is that too much um you know ... you think that's a bad trade ... uh that's a great tree I think for me but what are you guys think\nYeah the when when people offer you like money on the street or like gold Leon they just say here at this this is for you usually you don't want to be in place you want to take and that's what's happening with your deal you're Benjamin somebody is loading you up with the straight and Michael Thomas as good as he is\nHe is not worth as much as Sony Michel who's apparently closer to blame than we thought carry on Johnson Andrew Luck it's been a great fantasy quarterback this year and it's a point for completion goodness he's going to be outstanding that league and Calvin really on top of that I don't see how yeah yeah and if\nIf um if he kinda backs outlaw it gives me three which would you go for if I had the ...\nIt depends on what your receiver dances eyedropper ... I have\nThe number two for we're Orleans\nA trick question is do you mean yeah that's it that there was that now I have and\nI have um killed called ... either ...\nOr drop Andrew Luck no no really I I think if if you have to cook really out of the deal then that's what you do Benjamin but then this precipitation another trade where you're getting Andrew Luck you obviously have a quarterback on your team already that's not Andrew Luck maybe a trade him for the best receiver that you can get just to get that back at white out\nYeah I'll just say quickly as I say we have another caller from Pittsburgh where we're obviously on in Pittsburgh and and uh it's been a ... it's been a tough day it's been a tough week uh just terrible and um I guess we'll just look to sports into fantasy take our minds of it I'm so sorry for everybody and Pittsburgh everybody affected\nBy it we're all affected by it for sure uh chatting Austin's on the line Dave what's called a rapid fire here to finish the\nFirst hour here gets as many as we can chat what's your question real quick my man\nHey what's happening in a town outside of Boston [laughter] I've got a game is when fans are Kirk Cousins and I also unfortunately have to pick up a kicker who do I drop Smith or Taylor Gabriel\nYours and also says the more time we spend getting to know our kids having real conversations when there isn't a problem ... easier at night need prevent argument ... bucks and family at least to me\nWhat happened after the game Joe Thomas ... all three of them Charlottesville\nW.

I'm going to start him\nBased on what I've seen from him and Carson went over the last couple of weeks I Know the match it's going to be tough I think Philadelphia finds a way to get them involved\nJulian Edelman Monday Night\nLike I'm Better and the PR leaks than non it sounds like Rob Gronkowski is when a plane if that's the case in Helmand we'll just have limited numbers and I I feel better about him when ...\nNelson against coal\nI probably have a right to a little bit too low but I'm just doing it because I don't have a lot of great expectations and I think Indianapolis corners can at least hang with Jordan the game ...\nHow about Nick Chubb who'd you know got to target last week we know he's not super involved in the past in game and Pittsburgh's run defense really good Nick Chubb\nWell we haven't seen him be that involved in the past again but that time could come I just don't know if this is going to be the week for it I don't like a lot of running backs this week he's fifteenth for me but in a normal week we're all the running backs are playing he'd probably be closer to twenty or twenty fifth\nLarry Fitzgerald almost every wide receiver who's got an eight targets against the niners has had a good game Fitzgerald has had two straight games with eight targets how do you feel about Larry\nAnd it sounds like the new offensive coordinator Byron left which is going to use Larry Fitzgerald a lot more I've got um as a very low and number three receiver if you need a guy to replace one of your starters was on fire injured I think Larry can do the trick\nHow ... McCoy assuming he plays not a lot of upside not against the patriots I don't see him having a big game I don't feel good about um a curriculum men at Jacksonville in London believe it or not I like window smaller better it was two weeks we've seen small would\nGet more playing time get more opportunities on third downs of the catch opportunity should be there for him he just didn't score touched on two weeks ago and he kind of had a bad fall in that game last week he had a\nBig catching run play called back I like small with just a little bit better and the man of the hour ... most er I like most or love what I've seen from him and I love this cardinals run events because it's terrible and running backs do very well get some salt the Broncos that on\nThursday uh I I think you're going to see most or have an opportunity to get to double digits and fancy points\nAre let's hear from the people at age five five to one to four to two seven eight five five to one to four CBS we start out our number two with Don in Cleveland Don ... what are\nYour guys how's it going to be a a a quick\nQuestion I Need a second wide receiver to flex a lot of fun just a T jailed and Markey's Goodwin a sharp objects\nI'm going to go with both receivers here it's going to be fun just into Sean Jackson fun just doesn't have a great match up I liked him a lot more earlier in the week I think he can still\nPotentially find the end zone Jimmy Smith has been playing that great for Baltimore but the other corners there have been playing well so it's a matter of we winds up against the Sean Jackson just as high upside I like it better than your other options\nEric in San Diego at age five five to one to four to seven Eric what's up\nHey thanks for taking the call gosh they're out of a PR flex\nA got three choices [noise] uh I Would have saved for but you guys are talking about air and John So\nThrow him in there and Jones number one who else I\nGet what they were going ham Carson got Chris cars\nSay for but you guys are talking about air and John So\nThrow him in there and Jones number one who else I\nGet what they were going ham Carson got Chris Carson a Christian Kirk or a barber from Tampa against BP are\nBecause of the pie PR and because I Am not certain about Aaron Jones's upstart role and because of the magic we in San Francisco I'm going to go with Kirk and I'm going apparent with Chris Carson leaving Aaron Jones in the dust you were right not to put them in there but it's very close between those two guys\nLeaving them in the dust and it's very close I seldom ever do that leaves the rams into dust but we just haven't seen enough of it yeah who you think the Packers every chance there to win the game yeah no yeah I don't I I really don't I don't think the defense is

because he had ten fancy points then and since then it's been a disappointment city I'm I'm going to keep believing that he's going to be in good old D.C disappointment city\nThat's pretty funny that DC you know 'cause it's on the red skins very go yes uh Dave I get a question for the\nHelm than if let's say you had tickets to the game last night the world series game sure how many of the Eighteen innings you think\nYou would have stayed for remember it was it was west coast so\nWell you're talking to a guy who's not a big baseball fan unless his team is playing and my team is not the red Sox nor the Dodgers so I probably would have been out of there after the first\n[laughter] my friend left to the sixteenth okay I mean I can you can listen he thought Dodgers are Red Sox fan I was just a baseball fan\nSo you know this I'm a White Sox fan I'm from Chicago I Love the Chicago White Sox if the White Sox are in the world series and I'm a wait to see it I'm going to be at the games are\nGoing to be at wait a second yeah but they have like it's kind of a critical coming from you why because you know what happened last side the White Sox were in the world series while I was asleep fell asleep so he ... he didn't make the world series and eighty years and here I Am asked out from\nAvoiding a hurricane that story for another time ah yeah now I could just imagine waiting it honestly one morning one morning I Wish they were already if\nAdam I went from tickets to the world series game for clenching game to falling asleep at my grandmother's condo after moving my family for for safety reasons a giant or\nThat was weird in South Florida we had to listen on the radio right you can watch it on TV because the power was out after some hurricanes is crazy yes All right onto a onto football yeah I mean the good news is I Lived yes that is good and the White Sox won eight five five\nTo one to four to to step in a World Series that\nPeople still can't stop talking about the White Sox what I don't Astros are a five\nTo one to four to seven or you're being sarcastic I forget no I wasn't I I certainly couldn't remember our toll free line is brought you buy Geico hey everyone here's a quick way you could save money switch to a guy go do you need homeowners renters or motorcycle insurance to\nGet it all at Geico dot com or maybe the world's worst World Series ever James\nSwitch to a guy go do you need homeowners renters or motorcycle insurance to get it all at Geico dot com or maybe the world's worst World Series ever James in Pennsylvania what's up James I thought it was but\nYeah I got a known your brown on my knees\nThrough the bowling Goodwin vendors like a coal rather than a calm the two of them\nWell made all centers is going to be the one for sure that you're going to go with um Cobb for me you think so is it just started out there you are thinking about it it's easier to go cop and good when PBR but ...\nGoodwin has been terrible and he's got it he had an amazing match up last week and he did nothing and now he is a tough matchup and I'm throwing good went out there\nAnd and so instead you're going to go with Randall ... yeah I mean back from injury double major in science and remove their games he's made one great score thirty points in the game the\nPackers I agree with you it's ugly so you know a good one yeah All right Sanders for sure and and James go with good when a as your number to Josh in Massachusetts what's up Josh or an eye on fantasy football\n... going to uh I have a running back question I Am dealing with the er Melvin Gordon by week and I'm looking at either jail enriched chard um Isaiah Colwell or Chris times and\nScoring please yes Mm\nYes well if it's ... the way to go I think the fact that he's caught six balls and three of his last war games means something and I think you'll see\nA couple of added targets with mark Cooper it out there and maybe a couple of carries with Martian Lynch not there I just came across yes like a very strange well because I I was in my ring Josh is voice\nAdam oh oh yeah Adam in Pittsburgh what's up at um you're an eye on fantasy football\nSay how's that going on and so I mean a a PR league and I got to start to two running backs a ... pretty much a lock I'm going to start him um so I have a with a B Maria carry on drunk and then Jordan Howard for the other spot and I'm not really sure um if I can trust Howard or carry on right now\nTo ... to your carry on my way or it's my eyes wasn't going to sing it well I'll set you up\nTo sing to carry on aren't you get a job than I Am\nGoing to say carry on jobs and I think his workload will be the largest of the three I think his match up is probably second best of the three but because we don't know how many carries Jordan Howard we'll get nor how effective it will be with them I think Johnson makes a lot of sense to be your number two running backs\nEight five five to one to four to two seven

the one I have a guest with me in Studio we know how I Love that men do\nGood all Mindy is the executive director of the Charlottesville police foundation and\nWhich was founded by the way in two thousand four whose mission it is as an independent non profit organization of local citizens to help the Charlottesville police department to get to the tools and training they need to do their best work good morning Mindy how are you good\nMorning I'm fine thanks for having me much hello this is terrific we you know we've talked a couple of times on radio prior\nTo this but this is the first time she's doing to come to the studio\nOh happy to be here thanks for inviting me to your house oh my pleasure\nMy pleasure so tell us a little more about what exactly is the Charlottesville police foundation and why is it necessary\nChore I'm at so exactly what you said we're a nonprofit and our mission is to support the Charlottesville police department in their mission to serve and protect our community and we do that in a variety of ways it's it's you know obviously our tax dollars go to the police department in part to the police department um to help pay for salaries and vehicles and benefits\nFor the police officers but really most\nThriving communities have a police foundation and and and we are no exception to that all of our county also has a police foundation to support the ... county police department\nUniform are nice and we've always been a ... a nice ... what you're doing I mean do they need that they really need\nThat because I think there's a small but very vocal\nGroup of people not just in Charlottesville around the nation that would like to really be critical of police officers know police officers are not perfect\nThe foundation is not simply just cheerleaders for the department we're working really hard to make sure that they are you know transparent and that they are you know doing their job and they really by and large are you um and and so I think it's really important for us to\nYou know the the people who are supportive of the police department are are a lot quieter because you know it is hard we don't want to have it a U.S versus them and you know kind of situation\nBut I think that we can get louder and showing our support and you know our appreciation dinner is a great way to do that ...\nSo we're going to talk about that appreciate and dinner a that's coming up or would we say November So\nNovember seventeenth is the day okay and where is that it was taking place at the borders head pavilion and it is it the event is a closed event it is just for the police officers and their gas but it is just a terrific opportunity for the public to show support\nExactly and one of the ways that can show support is to go to your website and\nSo at ... police foundation dot org we have a tree to cop to dinner at link and you know I think it's such a great concept to think like you know wouldn't it be great if you could just you know sometimes when you see a police officer out my husband and I will just you know pay for their their lunch or dinner well this is a chance to really\nPay for their dinner that night and so for fifty\nDollars you can sponsor one police officer to have it you know a really nice dinner with their loved ones and members of the of the police department um and it for five hundred dollars you can sponsor an entire table and you get a nice table marker at this table sponsored by march ... do and and uh and then\nThe dollars you can sponsor an entire table and you get a nice table marker at the table sponsored by Marcelo Rolando and and ah and then you were also looking for a few more event sponsors that the two thousand dollar level\nUm and so we really encourage people to do that we put all the names of the people and the businesses that have supported them in the program and I will tell you the police officers read that list it means a lot to them they are they are looking for thanks especially right now\nUm and and another thing that people can do in addition to donating is on that same page on our website you can send a message of thanks and you can just put your name there and you can even just say something really basic about thank you for all that you do um but I've also got some really great stories from people\nWho have set in and said this specific incident happened and I'm so appreciative of how the police were there\nFor me or were there for my kids are just even like you know gave a high five to my kid when we were walking down the street and um so I really encourage people to do that we show those messages up thanks up on I'm a big screen at the dinner and the police officers lot that\nYou know of course I had a a just a quick comment before we go to another break I have a conversation\nWith a a policeman and um\nHe didn't want to come on the show but I did ask what message you want to give us that's what I said and he his response was\nIt's important for people to know you don't just call the police because you don't like someone you know you see in your building or whatever you are calling a of someone who can bring with that potential deadly force\nThat's so you need to be proven and wise\nAnd pick up that phone but if you have a if you have an emergency we should be the first call and I've never forgotten it okay and we're All right we're going to take another short break we're having a conversation\nWith men do good all who is in the studio today so stay with us [noise]\nA new meaning rose\nYou can you say my water heater

Joel Rolando am I guess in the studio today is Mindy good ol' I mentioned something it's\nFor your dreams become your oldest more Joel Rolando of them are just in the studio today is Mindy\nGood ol' I mentioned something about what a policeman of the church community message people's pick up the phone without justifiable cause but\nYeah it's really interesting you say that so uh you know one of the hot topics in Charlottesville right now is the\nDisproportionate minority contact and specifically some of the the stop and frisk numbers and had just a fascinating conversation with one of our board members who is an African American male I had seen him out walking one day and he said he told me he said well I'm usually walking with a walking stick and I said oh do you have a limp or some kind of injury and he said no\nHe said as a black male I have found he lives in a predominantly white neighborhood I have found that when I have a distinguishing characteristics such as walking with the walking stick and people when they look out their window they see oh there's a gentleman with the walking ... instead of there's a black man walking through my neighborhood and he said\nWhat has happened is that people will pick up the\nPhone and call nine one one and say there is a suspicious person walking through my neighborhood and if the dispatcher does not have the training or the information to know you should say\nWhy is this person suspicious is this person trying the door handle in your car or peering in your windows or ... a weapon if they just simply put\nThe call through to the police officer than the police officers told you need to go look there's a suspicious person this person looks like you know the you know give some characteristic of\nThe police officer then shows up and stops the person and this is a contact with a minority which did not need to happen now is that is because of racism on the part of the police officer\nIs it because of racism because on the part of the dispatcher or the initial call that was made it's a complicated issue you know I think what she Brakkton is trying to do is push back and say we need to find out\nWhy are these stops being made with this officer initiated where these initiated by a nine one one call and I think that's really important for us to understand exactly what's going on and that we don't put blame on the wrong people not to say once again that all police officers are perfect and that they don't have any internal bias\nEverybody has internal bias and we need to continue to work on those issues but I think that we need to be wise about how we really look at this issue\nOr you know there is so important and it's going to marry is what I wanted to go to mix with a I had no idea until we talked to there are people who are not comfortable with the legitimacy of police officers and I just wonder why would you run into the\nSo this is this is one of the things that um when I speak with Chief Bratton me about how the Charlottesville\nPolice foundation can be helpful we talk about police legitimacy 'em and you know police legitimacy is the extent to which members of the public can can see police officers being legitimate and a lot of times you can measure that\nBy how willing if the public to obey and cooperate with the police and what we're seeing in Charlottesville right now you know but certain members of the public are actually getting a police officers' faces\nAre screaming and yelling at them or telling them that they're all racist and that they're all bias and they are not cooperating and it's actually potentially going to be dangerous [noise] um for members of the public as well as the police officers\nAnd so it is definitely an issue and this is happening I think because I mean we could speak for hours and hours about why it's happening\nIt's something that we need to work on as a community and and it's something that is at the forefront of the minds of us foundation members and we need to not just have you know the police department be working on this but we need members of the community to really step\nFor a friend of the minds of us foundation members and we need to not just have you know the police department be working on this but we need members of the community to really step up and restore this police legitimacy as well as you know internally making sure\nThat the police department that we are being transparent ... and that we are looking at any potential issues that we might have to be able to look at the numbers of of you know who is being stopped why are they being stopped and find out if there is an issue that we need to be addressing internally\nYes and I wonder especially a well they were criticized for not doing enough\nIn in August twenty Seventeen and then grew sized who are doing too much or whatever this year it\nCan seem to win but how do you get business owners in the community as well as individuals to be supportive of not only the coalition police foundation but the police department and so\nInformation you should know\nUse your host responding [noise]\nIt's not so unusual for parents to provide some financial support to their children to help them get started in life\nBut a recent study shows the dollar amount of parental financial support has exploded here to explain is Ken ... CEO and founder of age wave which code develop this study with Merrill Lynch can tell us what's your research showed as to how much support parents are giving their kids annually now\nWell ... we've always known the parents you know support and provide a lot of care and love and financial backup to children to toddlers I mean that's just considered sort of normal that's just a part of the exercise but\nWhen we saw how much that was calculated to be back in the Nineteen sixties the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen was twenty five thousand dollars\nToday the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen is two hundred and thirty thousand dollars which is a lot yeah but the real shocker came\nWhen we went beyond the Eighteen year olds there's been a lot of talk Christ the last ... years about boomerang kids and the idea that it's twenty five or thirty year old because of the high cost of rental housing and paying down college debts\nAnd you know inability to kind of get launched a lot of those kids are living with their parents and we found that indeed that is true\nThirty one percent of all Americans between the ages of Eighteen and thirty four are living with their parents which is the most common living arrangement among early adult more people do that than live with a spouse roommates or by themselves\nBut what really knocked us out of our seats was we began to calculate beyond that you know having your child sort of in your house and you're providing\nGroceries and maybe letting them watch your Netflix we found out that there were five hundred billion dollars in addition spent by parents on their adult children subsidizing their cell phone bills rental costs helping to pay down debt\nSending them modifications which turned out to be twice as much as what those very same people were putting into their retirement accounts which was two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year\nYeah I was going to ask about how that compares to the retirement number so it seems like a lot of parents may be sacrificing their retirement years to keep their kids going\nSince a study launched some of the reflections are hey what what those kids do they even realize that they're taking so much from their parents other people have said hey you know what parents seem to like it it's sort of you know the next stage of the helicopter during an hovering\nWanting your kids to be competitive to live comfortably to be happy\nTo get the best shot at a good life\nBut the concern is is that those very same\nWell intentioned parents and maybe even well intentioned kids could be jeopardizing their own retirement security because\nIf you have on average seven thousand dollars a year going out to each child throughout their young adult years that's a lot of money and many of those very same people can't even afford their own bills\nAnd their own retirement savings building that nest eggs so to take so much of their resources\nAnd continue to support their kids is worth of discussion\nTalking with Ken ... is CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids\nUnder the age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids we're talking about millennials kids here I think what age range or the parents who are contributing all this money or these boomers primarily or younger\nIf we're looking at what are called early adults with your Eighteenth thirty four year olds that side of the Census Bureau and sociologist categorize that the parents are going to range anywhere from forty to about Seventy\nSo they're boomers and Gen x ers often\nIn the peak of earning years of their lives so they might be feeling kinda flush but on the other hand we know that about half of those people have almost nothing save for their own retirement so it may be short sighted for\nSo many people and by the way Ninety two percent crash of parents are\nProviding some subset of the nation of the early adult children so it's not just middle income it's not just high net worth it's not people who are modestly resource it's kind of everyone this has become the new normal and we have never before in American history maybe world history\nSeen a situation like this I Know I was born in Nineteen fifty one I was growing up when you turn Eighteen or twenty or graduated school you're pretty much on your own right and in fact if you ask for money a handout from your parents I was something you were a little bit ashamed of\nAnd you work in a live at home with your parents 'cause ours balancing today\nIt's become quite normal and it's hard to know if these parents are empowering their kids by helping them out or as they say\nAnd ... and therefore weakening them but this discussion is going to be had this is a new phenomenon these young people are taking a little bit longer to get launched and their parents had generously are trying to help them along the way but they may not be able to really afford it\nCan't why do you see millennials struggling to launch you know their own lives is it because of student loans or is it the cost of living in the rent cost in major cities is there a single factor there\nI think there's a few forces one of them is that back in the Nineteen sixties the cost of a public college was about five hundred dollars per year for tuition now it's about ten thousand\nCosts for a private college back then was about three thousand dollars a year now it averages thirty five thousand dollars a year we've been worried about the cost of automobiles or gasoline going up but there's been no big outcry over the fact that tuition for colleges has just been skyrocketing\nAnd so for a lot of young people who want to get ahead they have to take out loans by the way more girls take out loans to boys because more young women are graduating college than guys are so\nThat's number one very expensive number to those college loans can be three four hundred dollars a month every month on top of that bourbon environments housing has become extremely expensive and so here he's got these twenty five and thirty year olds who are straddled often with college debt\nThe other thing that's happening with these young people\nIs it they actually get along really great with their parents back for example an earlier era there might have been one TV set and the few telephone so people kind of how to share if they lived in a home\nNow a young person can live and their mom and dad's home maybe help with the chores they can go in their own room and watch Netflix if that's what they like and they can come and go as they please\nSo it's become more accepting and acceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kind of like to help out that may be just as big a challenge\nAn acceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kinda liked to help out that may be just the biggest challenges weaning them off of this idea of continually helping their kids as it is a challenge to have these kids got to get their umbilical cords cut and got out on their own\nDo you have any advice for parents who might be listening who are thinking hey maybe I Do need to cut back is there an easy way to do that\nI think it's a series of discussion first of all I think if it's a single parent or there's a couple parents\nTo stop and say well this heard this program let me make sure I understand what's going on here are we doing that oil yeah we are can we afford to and when is the exit strategy going to come into play\nWe talk to young people in focus groups and they said well yeah parents pay your phone bills in your health bill in your car insurance that's just what parents do\nSo they didn't think that they were being mean by asking for that they start that's the part of the parent project\nSo to answer your question I think parents need to think seriously and responsibly about what they can afford that they don't ultimately wind up in trouble financially and having to be a burden on those very same kid the ...\nThat they're trying to be so kind to and there needs to be discussions between the generations\nOn top of that in our study Ninety percent of greed that financial education should be taught at high school a lot of the parents were saying you know we try to teach our kids were not even exactly sure how to teach 'em in this modern age\nAnd social media is having a big impact on them there needs to be some standard basic level of financial education so people can learn about managing debt and the value of compounding and living within your means\nWhich is no longer that certain out there in our life so a combination of\nTaking stock drawing boundaries that just cutting your kids off tonight but developing sort of a game plan so that in one year or in three years and making sure the kids get that and then being sure that they've got the financial education to be able to make wise decisions\nCan jak walled CEO and founder of age ways each wave developed this study we've been talking about with Merrill Lynch can if people want to learn more is there a Web

I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months\nYou're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in has a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand adoptable every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year\nThis is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime\nOf this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable or you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or\nExpensive they are going to be up into your future and so so that means for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nMm I mean my issue is is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been doing is I mean I\nAnd literally on like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been doing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really are likely here right now\nOn what I I'm I'm hoping over time on the opposite you know take out more\nSo why are we getting through memory at an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where in\nOrder to identify that that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand island that I made I don't make a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switched jobs but had more flexibility\nOn some at a fee for service division as opposed to a salaried position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred to Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck on\nI knew he got twice a month ... you get twice a month okay then you said you're living with them\nAnd I guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I pay nine Seventy five or rent each of us to a lot um and I do get some help from ...\n... and uh what is the nature of the student loan\nDebt is everything credit cards I'll also because they can have said I was trying to ... stick things mhm um medical and then it's student loan as most of it is like fifty thousand it sounds like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in the food pantry\nNot eating not eating outside\nAnd you're paying more than half your life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food\nShoulders loading and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you were just fell out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to be here for these medical expenses or they're going to\nBe new debt right because they are coming\nYou told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying great actually I've I've got ... medical how to prepare\nFor you save in coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and as long as your career and\nHas to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face and so um but that's how I Would begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you\nSo that you can you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards it's time for a plastic surgery\nTucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step the right now I'm at that we just paid off our second credit card today though we are deli credit card and moving on the line\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working to baby sit too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday at um after church we had a big argument about tithing I don't think that we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not um\nBig argument about hiding I don't think that we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get it later on on what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of about being hit the ball and get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent [noise] but it but we want to die without speaking about Clinton got up\nAnd giving back to a church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other\nCharitable organization that we believe in that are about doing day or a ... you know doing the crisis mission and so we're trying to get so we can add try to do what we can to people who need it um but then she don't love and wanting to strike and present a church and then\nYou are or what we do what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give to chart\nWe had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nOut on the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is tense it literally means to end the word means to him\nIt doesn't mean fear that doesn't mean twenty if it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look\nFor what the scripture tells me to do I'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is\nDoesn't matter what Tucker plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love you and um you can give are not given all still love\nYou the best way to live your life is to to give\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed the New Testament is a time of attempts of you're in some evangelicals are taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years the ... is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical not your wife and his argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that brother [laughter]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have\nTo be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nIn your life is a train wreck those are the times when if you turn to the lord you are it's like the most your you become the most eligible for an encounter with God and David proves that in his lowest moment probably in his life\nHe has this intimate\nTime with the lord and I read that and I'm just like wow that is just blows me away but hey John thanks for being on the show [laughter] let\nMe I don't think you're trying to give me a message about ...\nWhat are they are so do do but the spirit do worse right though um I just had to share with you is\nJust so just so blown away by that and again I I I often when I read a passage I'll read it in and I'd be usually first denied might roll over to the amplified or the expanded bubble in this case where I really found\nIt was speaking to me was in the passion translation and so um anyway John I really want to get to you in on the show what we like to do is talk a little bit at the beginning about one's faith journey so which you cannot walk us through kind of how you have become a man of face\nOr I'll be glad to do that I'm so grow up in Charlottesville and I'm attending church Westminster Presbyterian and sort of had the the religion he's going\n[noise] um and I think over time it's develop more into what's what's the real relationship and what's the real faith piece of it not just the religion part in ... and um and I'll tell you that the place that really sort of ...\nAnd what's the real faith piece of it not just the religion part in ... and um and I'll tell you that the place that really sort of made the biggest difference was coming back to Charlottesville so um went to the University of Virginia here and then\nWorked my way out to the San Francisco bay area and spent Thirty years in Silicon valley\nAnd back in two thousand ten\nAnd I'm quickly met you and Rob are churning number of folks and there was the face of leadership group that\nI discovered when I was probably still about a dozen people and I remember reading an arches or just for the ... and um and I had been ... encouraged a lot at the church out in Menlo Park California which was a large church with a very good one with great sermons and messages\nAnd but it had five thousand members and what was often said was hate joined a small group it really makes a difference and I never really did that um but when I got here I found that the faith and leadership group in effect\nBecame my small room even though now we're up to fifty people out at at the Hyatt and you know fifty over Farmington in other places like that\nIt's it's still has that small group feel and and and what it's done\nIs it has encouraged me to really\nTake a look at the Bible on a daily basis I'm One of the things that Pete heart was brought up to tell me a lot was that if you look at proverbs there's one for every day of the of the month and and I find that I'll get up and I'll Try to read read that every morning\nAnd the right thing is you know on the tenth twelve Fifteen breathing there's something new and it's in there and the and the Bible is is saying something that um that I didn't pick up before\nAnd and so you ought to encourage people to to take a look from that standpoint because the Bible can be hard to get into and to really understand and\nI'm just as you just read a really long so much I turned to those as well\nUm and you've given me some short ones that that are great um you know there's a traditional songs twenty three that I Will talk a little bit more when we talk about my son Kendall\nUm but also some Ninety One which is a great one that talks about angels lifting you up I'm at but there's also a place there that's nine one one that may have a message and it of itself and then lastly the one that you've given me that's been the most help a genesis fifty wanting\nWhere it talks about what was meant for evil God will turn to good and the safety of many lives and um and again we get into Kendall story\nUm that speaks to me tremendously and that's what we really hope we do is we we help folks um say live\nWhat do you think and this is everyday faith radio John Stacy is our guest on the program ... what do you think it is it difficult for people to\nAh let's let's talk about the relationship peace it seems like the religion in due to full piece of church sort of kind of comes naturally to a lot of people it's it may maybe we're we're check the box type people okay I went to church check\nA and then kind of move on\nBut when it comes to that part about relationship and having a relationship with God through Jesus why do you think that's a difficult for people and and I and I ... I asked that question as one who's really struggled with it well\nI'm I'm sort of surprised you say that for you because um as you and I've talked you have moments where you hear a guy talking to you and I and I think a lot of us being included um we think we're supposed to have those burning Bush moments\nHave moments where you hear a guy talking to you and I and I think a lot of us being included um we think we're supposed to have those burning Bush moments where where it's really clear\nAnd and what I realized over time is if I really step back and I think about prayers that I've had 'em and I really look\nI'll find their places where they've been answered it just they been answered in a way that was very different than what I may have wanted or what I may have been looking for ... and and as you start to build sort of a library of those and and see those coming\nI think that starts to open things up for for asking yourself okay what's guy trying to teach me here and and waterways that God winked at me and um and we can talk about that a little bit more later on as well and\nWell it's I'm I'm flattered that you said that about the relationship peace with respect in my life but John in full disclosure and the the listeners have heard me talk about this I'm not kidding I went through a forty year period of my life\nWhere I you know maybe I heard a little something from God but there was certainly no relationship\nAspects of my walk with faith was more\nCheck the box checked the box checked the box and then once I had\nKind of a breakthrough encounter with Jesus ... um the ... thing David to we've talked about and so I'm fifty one and so I'm sixteen he he hands this bird it says in your presence is boldness of joy\nI had the opportunity of experiencing that about a decade ago is experiencing\nThe fullness of joy and for what I found this one I had that experience encounter whatever you want to cope with Jesus\nI'm I've found that nothing else would do and that became\nKind of a new obsession of my life all the obsession of my life and um once I sort of got an a if you would poked by Jesus I just continue to pursue pursue pursue and what I found is the more\nThe ... and this is biblical a leading to God and he will lean and do you what I found is the more that I kind of dug in in in the place for me to dig in\nWas scripture because it was all kind of fresh territory for me I hadn't really read the Bible before and so all of a sudden I'm reading and reading a consuming consuming\nIt the the Bible says that um you know as you\nFollowed the lord he will reveal himself to you I'm paraphrasing\nBut um when you start to receive that revelation everything changes everything changes\nAnd I will say it hasn't been easy doesn't mean your life will be easy from that point forward\nBut um you get a ... a new perspective and I will say everything's better hasn't been easy in heart that everything's better and and\nEven during some really really difficult times we're going to take a break here this is everyday face radio we have my friend John Stacey on the program we'll talk about in the second half of the program how God shows up

Christmas gift giving a list and Adam we've got so many great ones coming out called the devil in DC winning back the country from ... in Washington and I don't want to go into the subjects would get from\nYour title Sheryl is that either we watch K Street and we look at how much money gets transferred both political parties I think are equally guilty\nOf this uh they've got their special interests they there is profit to be made by being the majority party or in there and and all of this is what Trump I spoke to so eloquently when he called it the swamp is that there's just like this venture capital firm called the federal government\nYou have to give it your money 'cause you go to prison otherwise and then it gets to play with your money is if it's monopoly game um is that breaking up is because there's a there's a feeling I think some people don't think it's breaking up fast enough\nOh look Trump was a president who did not take the million dollars of donations ... me too\nAnd I think that's what set people on edge trade off a the patriotic Americans curious because they could see that he was starting from a clean slate and what isn't going to enter office beholden to a hundred different interests\nBut a hundred different interests of course or or take time off because\nTheir influence you know from day one and they didn't have an open door to the White House so\nIt my my book actually opens with a chapter about the partisanship of politics and the money in politics and it goes back in time to show that you know our founding fathers never intended our nation to be a politicized bi partisanship they did not even want\nStabbed wish political parties\nTo when they wanted all the all the candidates to basically when based on people's the people's vote they didn't want\nTo when they wanted all the all the candidates to basically when based on people's the people's vote they didn't want just Republican Party and just the Democratic party and this is where we're at now and this is why there's so much money in politics because it just is funneled through one of two different systems and\nYou know most of our politicians nowadays are basically bought and paid for\nIs there are ... and this is a theory piece that I throw out to people at cocktail parties taboo and think oh chose a little weird\nBut you know let's let's start with something simple like removing the guaranteed ballot placement of both political parties or and or indoor guaranteeing anyone who you know just pays the feed the voter registrar they get on the ballot like they do kind of in New York state\nOr were you going to have a libertarian and the Green Party and and there's no there's no guaranteed spot for just the Republican and the Democrat and sort of take that power position in a way where you have to kiss the ring of the party in order to get onto the ballot to get a loan from the voters in the first place\nYou know I don't I I I don't see why that is a ... that's how it is and I did and may I don't have a problem with that and I also don't have a problem with\nAmericans taking action on their own new rail back the influence of the main parties uh you know for instance I suggest stopped funding the RMC and the dance say instead take issues that are of\nConcern to you and give your money to those nonprofits and I think judicial watched as a tremendous job\nOf letting American people know what's going on behind the scenes in politics on judicial watches a nonprofit so instead of donated are in the why not give money to judicial watch or if it housing affordable housing as you're saying\nYou know donate money to habitat for humanity ... the idea is let's real that that money going into the political system and political machine and start bolstering the amount of money that goes into some of these nonprofits that can actually do the work for the people the little people in America not the political parties\nI Love what you're saying because so often I feel like is certainly the left but I think there's a lot of Republicans as well who feel like OK I voted for the right person I'm done here I can go back home uh and and that's not\nYou know if if a candidate for office says I Want to help women and you vote for them well that doesn't really view of the need to maybe volunteer for a sexual assault agency or something like that uh we you know we can't vote for our good community services uh we have to do them ourselves as great\nA great idea for that and and take all that money away from because that is the power of basically within and as you mentioned Trump really kind of came in around the outside\nOf that ... ... what do you make of the fact that in the last couple of weeks we've seen a lot of democratic candidates laughable having two two one two or three to one advantages over their Republican opponents in fundraising all of a sudden say when we need comprehensive\nA election reform and ah and the campaign finance reform I worry that we're going into a place where we're going to federalize or elections and in the government will determine who are candidates are and how much money they get a is that a danger because I feel like conservatives are kind of be pushed that way as well\nYeah I I agree with you and I think it's rather dangerous I I I find it hypocritical on the situation that you just described Democrats right now and I I actually don't like any talk of\nA limit to campaign finding I think that that's just a natural First Amendment issue that I as a as an individual shipping\nCampaign finding I hang that that shift and natural First Amendment issue that I as a as an individual should be able to donate as much money is I Want whatever candidate I Want because\nI have enough money to do and I want to see this person uh you know in political power and I also think corporations should be able to donate as much money as they want to whatever candidate they weren't as well where I think we need improvement and massive improvement is the sunshine that goes into the donations\n... if I favor being\nAble to give as much money to whatever candidate you want so long as there is opening trends parenting about where all that money is coming from yeah I think that's where we need to put our efforts\nAnd you mentioned judicial launches a great a region of that as a matter of fact some of the few very few things we've learned about Hillary's emails and things like that have come from judicial watch but also a lot of the campaign finance issues and or even locally here the path\nOr has been terrific uh the Virginia public access a process towards this we are putting it out to you know just where you to look at whether it and you know means in ... do you are not\nSo where do you think what is your sense going in as we finish up here Cheryl going into the midterms I said months ago that it's not going to be so much a blue wave as a rearranging the deck chairs on you know insert name of cruise ship Titanic Lusitania where you know I don't know where to go where you think we're going a and I and I think that the\nUm oncologist from Santa Fe that came out and said that if it Medicare for all came in she would have to close her oncology practice in Santa Fe because she could no longer afford to run her clinic\nSort of tells you everything you need to know and a ... and again you you're going to find a boom for a hostile hospice care because a lot of people will be told sorry you can't get treatment for that or you're too old to get treatment for that or\nAre there is not enough time for you to earn back your money in tax generations or anything like that us who you're gonna find more people in their fifties and sixties\nOr being pushed into hospice care for chronic ailments like cancer and diabetes and things like that they're going to be a denied service because uh they're not young enough to ... back out for the society a and all these things that are no constitutional\n... yet they seem to think they can\nBuy their way around constitutional prohibitions Sally\nIt well I mean what you say is exactly right and if you look at the media coverage I'm In Canada and the u._k. candidates the only country in the developed world that had the truth single payer system I all private coverage is outlawed\nGreat Britain under the national health service which just turned Seventy this past summer\nThey allow private coverage to run parallel in about ten percent of Brett\nI'm have private coverage and they use it when they think they need an MRI or they need cancer surgery but what you read and the press is about bad blocking so there are a lot of elderly people in Canada and any okay who have nowhere to go and so they stay in the hospital beds\nAnd keep the people that need actual surgeries out of out of the bed so they're blocking beds and blocking people who really need treatment surgery and treatment after I'm getting into into the hospital\nWhen I first heard and I saw emails from Mark Warner promoting Tim Kaine and and ah bringing back healthcare I said gosh of they really run out of anything else to use against President Trump and and the Republicans are there circling back around to this classic from two thousand and eight\nGoals that older youths healthcare but it it it it's a winning argument because it's theoretical just so many voters or what would you do if it is a big goal boss ... word gifts\nOr if something happened to you what would you do where would you turn you lose all your savings and it's all based on this hypothetical fear mongering ... we obviously works because they've circled back around to it as a campaign idea\nRight and and so in health care and as you know is the number one issue I'm On the minds of voters in this election coming on November sex\nAnd the other thing is that you know the ... the recent Reuters poll showed that I'm Seventy percent of people polled supported Medicare for all and about eighty eighty percent of the Democrats than they pulled support it but you know as I say I mean how how\nMuch is it going to cost what how is it going to be paid for and people don't realize they just think oh that sounds great I'm going to have something for free and have the very best care and access to care um that that I Would ever won\nAnd people don't realize they just think oh that sounds great I'm going to have something for free and I have the very best\nCare and access to care um that that I Would ever want and they don't realize that in a country like candidate\nWhere the average wait last year from seeing a primary care doctor getting treatment by specialist with over five months Twenty one point two weeks into the American people are here with my mom used to say are becoming one of those impatient Americans but it's true that they just wouldn't put up with a ration care and the fact they have to wait\nAnd Bernice plan says that there would be no referrals to specialists well that's one of the way the government controls costs for example in Canada you have to see a primary care general practitioner\nMhm before you can actually go to a specialist so if he Bernie says there'll be no referrals mean specialist would just be overrun with patients and their salaries there than what they get paid would be much lower and therefore this is going to be another way to push\n... out of the practice of medicine and the shortage would be even worse for for us because we wouldn't be able to get access to care\nI'm Amy Carter

B. O.\nSally ... of the suffering research Institute a\nFew we were told that the Obamacare and you and I talked about it you know gosh going on ten years ago now a that Obamacare was going to be used to collapse the insurance system a sure enough or insurance companies started leaving as soon as the individual\nMandate got the other hand uh so then you your left leg in central Virginia with five hundred percent increases because there was only one insurance company laughed a ... and and forcing people to a cover things that they wouldn't normally cover a creates an assigned risk kind of ...\nWell after a ... and forcing people to a cover things that they wouldn't normally cover a creates an assigned risk kind of pool but you're going to have to throw people in the tuna raise costs as well and it's collapsing the insurance industry from the inside just as you said it would\nUm and and I'm afraid that we're going to be left to this and and no other choice no matter\n[noise] right well you know I mean when Obamacare turned\nA let's say twenty tended to eight years old on march twenty third of this year and it was interesting you know I always felt and I think you and I agreed to do that his whole idea was Obamacare um you know would not work at the the individual that into the exchanges wouldn't work\nAnd therefore we tried you know the private we try competition and therefore now we need to go to Medicare for all or a single payer\nAnd interestingly I President Trump a couple of weeks ago came out\nAnd said in the u._s._a. today op ed that\nHe was against single payer this country could not afford it\nAnd going back before he was president he thought it might be a model so I was very excited that he actually ... it would be too expensive and would deny care President Obama who when he was a state senator and Illinois was a proponent of single payer then when he became president and Obamacare came into being he said well he didn't support single payer\nBecause the American people love their employer based coverage and that is true they do\nAnd now he came out I'm just a couple of weeks ago and I think on September seven saying the Democrats have a whole lot of new ideas\nOut there including single payer so he's\nIn for it before he was against it and now he's for it again um it's really sort of interesting how this all you know kind of has you know unfolded but in it's it's it's a it's a disaster and as as Sima ... said and President Trump used the same line\nMedicare for all would become Medicare for non and I think people have to realize that you know what it would mean\nWell never mind the bankruptcy would bring about I mean I think somebody said that thirty two trillion dollars is more money than exists on the planet right now anyway but ah so I don't know how you grow your way out of them I'm not sure of the statistics on it a bit but moreover than that we talk of\nYour portable and on campus whole savings accounts and and major medical insurance not Asher employed we have now um you know those plans are out there you are the Republicans had their chance\nWith two years with President Trump saying I'm sitting here with a pen waiting to sign something and they couldn't do it what what ... do you have the the conservatives\nThat are running now for some of these retiring Republican should they managed to keep control of the house or do something so\nWell I mean I was very disappointed you know by late late summer twenty Seventeen because President Trump and the Republicans ran on a repeal and replace agenda\nAnd they weren't able to get it done which was was very sad and then of course the Democrats have been saying well they were for you know increasing um the Obamacare um law as we saw with you know high premiums high deductibles\nI'm In a small network of doctors and hospitals that the American people didn't like it and only eleven million people signed up on the exchanges we turned our health care system over for eleven\nYou know what the replacement plan for Obamacare which would be so\nIt's going to be it's going to be interesting but I think if they do if the Republicans Duke it does any one of those three would would be a good um speaker for the house side\n...

I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary to that it or how to handle it\nA good show he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it could happen you know an dollar\nOne of them they should be canceled ... okay if it's a whole lot of lot of insurance policy about half a million dollars is a very expensive\nRight yeah yeah and like my main concern is you know I found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean it's a great guy by not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own and I was a guy doesn't matter if it's a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids on\nThe idea is that a ... and like a great town on a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married ... how long you been married for five years five years they've not address this issue but strength the strength of it really\nI mean they should you should address the issue is that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled because I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money ... life insurance is a horrible financial product\nOr ... and so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your German blaze\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that\nUh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be doing it over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nNow I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's like I don't want anything you're paying for something I didn't know any of that but you have only take it it's\nNot only not only because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve\nHow are you\nDavid how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding out part of my retirement savings said comes as a thing called a pinch him from my company [laughter] and that\nOverall is a bad guy eight percent of my total has had a\n... ...\n... oh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement save two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that that would be by the gate pretended my total as pets you know and and my question is whether the gap has a lump sum\nYes or okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die that\nMoney's gone 'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is this Robert benefit\nThe money's gone it's gone and if you live in Iowa or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five\nPercent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking you know versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity button so\nIt's still one of your job in you know you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept applies so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Bijan lumps arms enroll them die of race and invest them and good roast like mutual fund so it sounds like you're networks in excess of a million ...\nUh yeah it's a closer to close that it's been a it's probably about four oh well they're total\nTotal network to assets house and so forth\nSo well known sharp congratulations\nHow old are you are I'm sixty three\nWhite ago how much of this did you inherit\n... I'm probably somewhere in a hurry to court hungry range from my my my family and my wife's family where are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nMillionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes\nA a millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type where all the triple a young at that point in time not a millionaire and not\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is ... maybe ... maybe ... percent\nOf its lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means lives they are a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I knew people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that\nBecause McCain every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do\nStupid things but then you can minimize those new things along the way and we have a modest lifestyle live below your means and I'm now void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize the stupid yeah maybe I can minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives

you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies\nThe warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to\nFight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors\nIn I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved\nWith it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat who very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nTo simply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with no what happens is is you need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is ...\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for\nPeople that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking the ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pain fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back\nPain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's their link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending the gleaming museum they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and\nBut ... which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nThreats or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting on life you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and you're about it actually started to manifest\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get that a powder form\nYou take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight

the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby well\nThat's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't really realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr biggest you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take this ... formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I a couple of years ago I

of months now I had the emergency fines and I'm working on baby step too good on my ... and I have made progress not a ton of ... it's on our back\nOn my issue is idea of a chronic illness on I still work fulltime I Am not letting it take over my life is good um my question is is how do I budget um for my deductible\nNominate ... recently I recently switched health clan fled stuff both started again I'm also the chronic unless you're going to hit the optimal every year\nRight um\nIt's ... the guy that nothing on the go at it it's not that audience not life threatening are you going to go to Doug able every year\nNow okay so ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that Iran is a it's a nerve pain conditions at the doctors are unsure of work on I'm okay um\nSo what's your what I Want to do is early on because it's relatively new yard I yeah\nGod and so if it was over there but I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new got I got I yeah for\nWhat I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year and the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because\nOnce you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months\nYou're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right\n[laughter] right and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand though the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA a whatever a line in your budget for medical expense ongoing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside so that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime\nOf this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable or that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future\nAnd so so thanks for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I told him I see where I can make that happen from what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really like right now\nOn what I'm I'm hoping over time on the opposite you know take out more\nSo why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nI had that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that I make I don't make a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch that job I had more flexibility on some in a fee for service division as opposed to

June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to to the house has sold six listings and pick spending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year and now what\nDoes your why didn't make of the ...\nWith the uh she made a fifty one dollars that\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much you use to make yes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she is bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long the span 'em and her thing is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making\nMoney to pay her car [laughter] [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for four and sickness and health\nAnd onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows and so it you know if you want to be divorced to get to keep whatever you want to create if you want to be married we are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go\nOh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one when we're married and and it's in sickness and health and\nRight now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these closing the courts will have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what what I oh I'm going to\nPay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is\nI'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one quarter for now\n... well I don't know I don't ...
