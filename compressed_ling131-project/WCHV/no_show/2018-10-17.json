Joseph shepherd was clearly Senator Claire McCaskill husband dead is he a bought up all these tax credits that again horse post the to help build cheap housing for the poor he flipped him\nDo other developers and in or near like you know billions of dollars a by doing that so he basically took of an joke of a program that was a tenant to help the poor\nYou know local Democrats let's go by helping to porches I slip them said personally and ...\n... and in that case all he was was an intermediary\nYou know liberal Democrats both go by helping the porch of a slip them said personally and ...\nAnd ... and in that case all he was was an intermediary you you know he he didn't actually do anything he just buys the tax credits up and then flip to them to other developers he was a marketing guy and he pulled a profit off\nThat exactly now it's crazy up finally teeth Alison I still don't understand\nWhy the major media is a dog in this one except for the fact that Keith ... Keith Ellison the person of color and he's a Muslim two strikes against it kind of like a ... now the abortion doctor if you've got a couple of those characteristics the media is happy to stay miles away from your story\nWell now this is what's really upset about this this we're supposed to be in the whole hashtags needs Hulu met right there since it's been just a little over a year's Harvey Weinstein was delayed broke\nAnd and but when it comes to a Democrat like\nA you know ... ... email us and uh his ex girlfriend has all these just atrocious charges about physical abuse that he did to her or she denies story but look the allegation the accusation\nI think that they at least deserves a especially in you know I you know and and look up the beats a little bit of the major push now that\nIt deserves ... so I perceptive little ... party followed up up up using his ex girlfriend\nSo there was some coverage of this on the network but it's just the old three minutes and forty seven seconds\nWell if you want to keep track of these stories that are being ignored by the major media check them out at media Research Center Jeff thanks a lot we appreciate your help\nThank you so much that is a pleasure to have you on let's go to your calls now Kevin's on the line Kevin welcome to Lars Larson sure what's on your mind on this Tuesday night\nHey thanks for taking my call 'em show I got three major differences a for Iraq Obama's a\nA ... approach versus a thousand whom smart on a couple of late ... early ... is a should be a crime um so you know their approach was quantitative easing his entire term which is in the sense\nPrinting money and giving it to the largest banks which the banks turned around and bought a a U.S treasury she got three percent interest off yep I'm you know a a Elizabeth Warren and a\nBernie Sanders a you know they've switched their tune now but if you uh do the research on that and even in her own book she Elizabeth Warren's thought that the whole time or going out to a ... a Timothy Geithner ah\nAh invented ... on that and uh the uh um the other thing is is that uh uh they took a a twenty three billion dollars or more I I guess it could be eighty eight a few really follow the math on it's diluted\nThe a U.S a shareholder or or worldwide shareholders in a General Motors and stepped in line and in a paid off the campaign deaths\nAnd um ah they were sued by a a teachers' unions police unions a civil action suits\nAh against that and uh um uh uh but nobody nobody uh uh squawks about that and um ah they they executed one of the worst\nHe uh nobody uh squawks about ed and uh they they executed\nOne of the worst crimes on the American taxpayer ever and and uh uh liberals will turn around and they'll talk about or Reaganomics or or even a tax cut\nA but is there on their example of a Reaganomics given to the rich and it trickles down her any bigger exam is there any bigger example of of a given money\nTo a printing money no borrowing and not moving from one place to the other but printing money and giving it to banks and hoping they lend it which they did not\nI don't think there is a good example of that and that's the thing that's ... ... what they call Keynesian economics economics but the idea being\nThat if you prime the pump up the economy by injecting a bunch of free money that that will make the pump start turning and that when you do that or start producing a a result\nBonnie tracked look I feel for people who are stuck in one of these countries where the government doesn't seem to address the prime of the problems of crimes and violence but that's an issue that needs to be resolved by each country\nOr if your government is persecuting you because you're gay or because you're a different religion or whatever I understand that but even then\nIs the standard was uh the economy stinks and there are a lot of there's a lot of criminal activity\nHow many of the seven billion people on planet earth might be able to credibly say you know those things are lousy back home I'd like to go somewhere else I Would imagine it'd be a very large number\n[noise] yeah and and that's the key point at set that of course is missing from the higher the empire ever we talk about these ... the first thing\nThey can set of facts ... an ... or ... or if you walk through all of that come to the United states can be a lot of all of that or we could I mean it would\nCompletely over on the United states that were allowed that to happen and we of course is laws in place that we have\nTo force a so so you know ... and you mentioned the seven billion people around the world about thirty to fifty percent of that also left to cover the United states that that that always helps people back home after you\nTry to help their economy improves try to help the government get all of\nA criminal activity that take place there and that's what President Trump play right now he is apparently told the president of hot Dora hey we're all federal funding guys stop this caravan added states or the ... and the fact\nChris ... is deputy director of numbers usa which does great work on immigration issues because by that standard I Would imagine that if\nThe current victims of criminal gangs you know all of them could get together and a Caribbean it'd probably be tens or hundreds of thousands of people and they left I'm sure the criminal gangs don't go out of business they just turn to the next set of victims until what until you into the country\nSo it's really not a ... it's not a solution and I think\nI even make the case crews and you tell me what you think of his argument that if you take some of the pressure off of our country by having some of the people in the worst situation leave\nKnowing that there's still nine million people that those criminal gangs couldn't pick on and steal from because that's what they do for you know for a living to get them get their money\nThat you in some ways you may actually put disillusioned farther away because the folks who are most ... most willing to pick up and pack up and leave and go somewhere else\nOr they aren't going to get rid of the the folks who are actually doing the bad act but they will they may take the pressure off the government to try to fix the reforms and and make the changes necessary to get rid of the problem altogether\n[noise] right right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using all probably use the caravan we've seen it a care of that\nThere are some that folks that little ... and and and try to take advantage of of the fact that you know ... coming out there I guess we're going to get to action they're going to have\nThe benefit of food and water that's going to make that make the track through through Mexico to the U.S Mexico border but but uh uh the vast majority of them are as you said that people are people that are really to work\nThat they were willing to how\nHow a car or a prosperous archery it that way\nThat are really\nReally how it cut off for a drink it that way at out there and a lot of it is is the possibility of like I'll go out and have done it stops a bite out of us said that you got the folk\nTrio I got back about three and a lot you\nKnow won't Chris thanks very much for having me that's gross ... numbers you say to your calls now Dan's on the line and California

half percent on your money and\nIf you die you lose it when you die if you when you die you lose now you know and so if you took the lump sum you'd be making ten twelve percent on your money invested

there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\n... she's open and cars and your name as well\nOkay well\nLet me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother to be picked up\nBut here's the thing the only way if someone opens on account in your name the only way to get that count cleared other than pay yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't know when when someone show your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who should hold your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister follow\nThe law properly on the police report is being sold out and said yes I Know who the audience\nSo who sold your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister follow the law properly on the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the is\nMy grandmother and I'm I'm surprised actually that they went and picked her up but they did and you know so I'm cut it is it is a federal law is a federal offense now to steal an identity and so um she she's in trouble\nShe's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right in ... but she may have been just mad and got interested in I don't know either way is fine

can we help today [laughter]\nYeah so I have a quick question for you so um my wife and I we we celebrated in house or we saw the one I'm with the money we paid off a lot of our\nDebt credit card car um a few other debt and the only that we have left is student loan debt mhm\nUh on and so we ... we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loans that [noise] um so we're just trying to figure out what we can do between the upgraded to a new house and the are the laws that we have left our we\nUm get that paid off but we're just trying to figure out how to do that\nUh spend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about I don't understand\nWell basically we're just we're just trying to figure out like a little bit there's three of them between us I I'm a teacher [laughter] um I Know that there are loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nA loan programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in debt in years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make to about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and uh how much is your house primary\n[noise] so we haven't gotten a person we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right at a fourth ... right and you have no other that except the student loans correct okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've gotta look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers were yours you're going to meet you where did you get your degrees\nOr so she has her last I got my bachelor's should we we both went to in a few northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on there um [noise]\nThank you for doing this and that leaves us with those in Atlanta Georgia are welcome to the Ramsey show Levi\nOn that are not as Irma what's up [noise]\nUm well right now I have a job and I'm making\nMaking about forty thousand a year\nAnd I'm Glad I got another job offer or thirty three\nAnd\nA ... and I'm considering it is because the the benefits are a lot better mhm I'm there for four one K. or paid holidays more vacation um they also pay one hundred percent of my health insurance from\nYour health insurance costs now I don't have any I Can't afford any mhm\nOh so the company that I'm interested I'm with now it's it's like five hundred dollars a month or something to discriminate mhm mhm\nSo out of dollars in five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars\nMhm you're going to trade six for non\nIf you're doing it for health insurance four one K. been a fool's worth very little and the other benefits and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nIf you're doing it for health insurance the four oh one K. benefit is worth very little and the other benefits and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nMhm well that and the potential to grow with that company would be a lot more\nQuickly I'm On the next year or two would you double your income um wouldn't quite double it now how quickly the W like I couldn't I couldn't be looking at the next two years I can be looking at like maybe maybe another ten thousand a year back up to where you were\nUm yes plus the health insurance you know\nWhat the the the benefits are worth very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits okay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love shark and takes six steps forward\n'cause I Want to or how old are you a twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today mhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today\nIf it's not taking you in that direction then you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that's a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job or in mind I don't I don't know exactly how I mean I don't know that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the it's a ... ... it could turn it could help transition me into the career I Want to be\nWhat do you want to be inches I Want to be a master diesel tech okay what do you do now I'm a welder\nOkay and what do you need to do to become a master diesel tech\nI Need to get my ... I Need to get all my diesel certifications\nOkay what's the shortest quickest way to do that at least they'll tell you that I Know a good mix along once in a way to go do a good diesel tech makes a lot more than forty two right\nDo yeah yeah I can be looking at like a hundred grand a year and that's what I was thinking okay so what's the shortest path there again we've got to get on the search how do you get the search um\nComedian or a technical school I guess at a at the only way I Know\nWhat's it like once you get into a company that would put me through the school\nDay you got what's the other hand like you're talking about working\n... what's the other place you're talking about working what do they do\nUm they actually they work on a big or um or Eighteen wheelers and trailers and stuff like that what kind of work that they do diesel that yeah they have then they have them there and stuff I Would just buy would be coming in in a different position to be coming in as a welder\nAnd how are you in and have welder and they'll pay for you to get your search and in three years you're doing sort of a ... sort of hard work and you go from thirty three to a hundred and then nobody gives a crap about health insurance we just tripled your income dude and you're doing what you want to do\nYeah now that's a plan\nSo anyway we're three hours in the interview if you like you say gently and kindly with a smile if you want me health insurance is not the carrot to dangle quickly getting made the search says the carrot to dangle and this rabbit will be going\nOkay\nBut I Need a plan I Need to know you can start to search what you do you work in a year before will pay for your search okay I'm In I'll take I'll take a pay cut for a year to get where I Want to go by the time I'm forty three okay but I'm not just taken a pay cut 'cause you gave me a little bit of lame oh health insurance okay wrong wrong motivator you follow me\n... yeah I get ... you might you might want ... percent chance toya [laughter]\nSo Jack Jack in a nice way lovingly negotiate with them jak 'em up and go do you got you a new welder if you'll pay for my search when can I start when we went

I'm Sorry we're a horrible thing so how old is your grandmother\nOr Seventy okay\nWell what you needed to get off the phone is you need to take back control of all your finances\nBefore the next hour arranged wells\nYou have thirty minutes to get it done okay if you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we've established that correct\nYeah it was never money with Ron Paul's money and with your sisters id and for all we know she just open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\nI'm not sure yet\nI'm telling you need to check your credit and see if she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you get rid of your checking account and is that what you're getting rid of take over and how does she handle their money\nSo I gave my checking account debit card and I'm\nJust go down to ... how are you just go down to the bank enclosure checking account\nJust close and whatever monies in their ... use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank a pill that bank what's going on that this lady is um\n... you know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but when you do get all control taken away from her or is that all she had was your debit card in striking down\nA lot of food and that's all she had of your money or your stuff so you get paid is ... is a direct deposit into your account\nSo okay so you need to change that as well right to the new account number two a day or today yeah are you going to do it today I Am ...\nOkay good and then you just call her up and say a running I got enrolled in a financial clash and so I'm going to take over my finances thank you for your help I'll take it from here and then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much debt if you got\nA lot of thought or that added up again and again it's a rolling around twenty fall on how many different creditors are you a a bachelors ... ... a hole that's like utility bills and that kinda stuff seriously\nI don't have any you don't have any then you don't have any debt well OK okay then you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nYes gay then you're gonna have to give them your new account numbers\nAnd get all that switched over to the day so that you take over the handling of your money and you can just like random rather know that you know with ... balls passing out much you'd have to fool with this one nation on won't take it over and I'm I'm enrolled in a financial class and I'm going to get control was uh twenty five year old man of my life\nAnd I'm doing silly and\nAnd the financial class and I'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life\nAnd I'm doing silly and ... I'm Sorry\nShe ... and now she's in jail why she in jail\nOn like the cost of coal arguing honing\nWow okay why don't you let her know that you took the bank account over a due to all this weird mission the family then\nVery interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now to get\nMad at all you know very sad sad\nTo be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\n... she's opened cards and your name as well OK well\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother it'd be picked up\nBut here's the thing the only way if someone opens an account in your name the only way to get that count cleared other than pay yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't know when when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who should hold your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and it's like your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the V. as my grandmother\nAnd I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did and\nYou know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal wall it is a federal offense now to steal an identity and so um she she's in trouble\nShe's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right in ... but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but um\nThose moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness ... sad thing though was horrible and you guys are going through that Cody um watch how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nOf forty thousand a year\nOkay All right are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our class\nI answer\nOkay

candidates feathering there twenty Nineteen nasty\nAndrew sneeze earned has gotten over the uh\nThe pain and swelling of having the fifth congressional district nomination rescued from him or by the big Hollywood money of um [noise]\nMostly Coburn and is now going to do apparently rung for comment also attorney maybe in a primary against duties ones were and I don't know but when I'm Talking about the three borders supervisors seats\nAll you know it doesn't matter which county three city council seats that remind the school board seats every seat in the Virginia house of delegates and state Senate up for election next year the Democrats are already thinking about it I haven't heard a peep\nOut of a conservative about it and yet you know these these reparation will socialist running around out here as I said oh it was oh\nLook through statistics say so I'm not crazy\nI just would like to see some commonsense brought back to its guys like Rick Randolph can be sent packing I've spoken to too many people in the Scots will mention cereal district you're like oh we got to get rid of well you had your chance what was wrong or a girl Smith\nWhat was wrong with the ... what would Earl Smith do what would Richard Lloyd do what would John Lowry be doing\nYou've had these cases where [noise] well\nYou know yeah\nYou know not perfect this ends impacting Dave Brat this year well I really liked the Eric Cantor and he promised me a job and patronage crime and and now I'm mad because I lost out on all that patronage because Eric got primary out\nSo good to have like Dave okay hope you like Nancy Pelosi let me get to you for three four nine six for one zero seven ... says it will be what's up\nI've got your yesterday in fact three years three years okay\nThis for years and uh there was no racial Charlottesville no they don't have to do until fell on me and ...\nOr ... or Fifteen minutes of fame but they also ignited a fire across this country and I believe all\nAnd and certainly they ... they were being prompted I think by people who have their strings attached to them they jumped on board out a horrific tragedy I mean you're talking about race profit tearing\nThese two jumped in on the on the shooting up over church a black church in South Carolina do their own mess say and and then you don't take a girl like so you enter Bryant\nAnd and proper up like their own little Charlottesville version of to want to Raleigh to oh I'm scared by a statue\nIn a Bryant and and proper up like their own little Charlottesville version of to want to ... to oh I'm scared by a statue\nAnd now we can see ... and and I told this story this testimonial from within Charlotte's whole high school student body the entirety of Charlottesville student body said no press\nAt the uh Parkland memorial except for the honor Brian who who ignored her classmates and what did it anyway you know this is this is the kind of stuff that has to be exposed not because I disliked these people\nBut because this is a con job and then at the same time you got a half calling the newsroom saying can somebody talk with the fact that we lost money were not getting as much money from the city of Charlotte is well despite the fact that they've tripled their affordable housing budget what we've already been down this road hip should not be surprised\nThat the but the Obama administration said that the Charlottesville housing in rural areas in your house or Charlottesville redevelopment and housing authority was one of the most corrupt band or Internet organizations in municipal history or certainly in Charlottesville\nSo you know is it a shock that they've tripled the amount of taxpayer money they've stopped up and and we still have affordable housing issues with the problem is and how much money we did see a jar you amber chrome or ... or whatever it's called\nUh it's it's the fact that Rick Randolph is this is the key to it all\nRick Randolph and his attitude of the plantation will take care of us all I mean the university will take care of us all we don't need more jobs in this area we played Dave Brat Adam Smith lots of small companies competing not one big company kicking money into your campaign coffers\nThat's our problem it has nothing to do with race if it has anything to do with color and has to do with green and gold\n... or ... you know we did not own slaves during the civil war but grant\nGrant slaves but nobody talks about\nWell and and even even beyond that really these grab at stake\nTools that get wheeled out to protest around Charlottesville statues and now on monument row enrichment talking nonsense about we're fighting against Jim Crow\nWell ... I ever noticed one I'd love to find out of ... Brian those even who Harry Byrd is never mind where the statue to him and to this day tarp plus a out in front of the capital of the the common all through Virginia\nAnd he was the guy that wrote all the Jim Crow laws he's the guy he's the bowl last proprietor of a resistance in Charlottesville was Harry Byrd and the massive resistance is and I'm not going to integrate the schools I don't care what the federal government says I'm keeping black kids in white didn't support\nIt and yet I have ... have you noticed any protests around how are you birds at you\nKnow I haven't ... if you have let me know I\nMean 'cause ... you know next one will probably be the first one I\nGo to Charlottesville because there's just so much disrespect\nBut here's the thing and and there are so many good people this is why Tony Nineteen is so much more of a fixation with me than twenty Eighteen is yes I think that we need to get all of the ...\nAnd and there are so many good people this is why Tony Nineteen is so much more of a fixation with me than twenty Eighteen is yes I think that we need to get all of the pro can't or an typewriters or even to the polls in the seventh district I think\nUh you know we need to get all the people who are sitting there saying gosh what ever happened to Robert hurt\nA you know get into the polls in the fifth district you know we need to get that because there's big money coming from Hollywood and you see it in for the seats but ... you're more than that there are three city council seeds\nThree borders supervisors seats minimum in all of these counties around the area school board seats and and every single seat in the Virginia general assembly\nTwenty Nineteen is massive and outside of interests either and who wants to run against Robert Tracey I haven't seen anyone and certainly you know conservatives talking about\nIf you're\nYou have to you have to right now it's neither is right he has to get out there in front of it now if we're if the conservative minded people of Charlottesville whether you run as a Democrat or libertarian it independent or\nRepublican or we you know that you have to get on the ground now you can't wait until after the midterms we have you is the ... of the midterms just start getting your name out there\nPerformed by a large number of people because they don't require ... actual skill oh yeah there there are people who are amazing salespeople amazing haberdashery ... Mike at them in Zimbabwe shop\nHead and shoulders he works his knees off while I mean he's already worked his knees off\n\nBut for the most part you get a job at Walmart and you're you know bringing up people who have bought a shirt that you know they they said you know by the size and they'll label fits\n\nSo you can be replaced by somebody else who could be taught how to work that cash register\n\nYour economic prosperity is based on the uniqueness of your skill set this was one of the things we talk about with rage scholar and the network to work program job skills training yes\nGet yourself some unique job skills that nobody else or very few people have and apply them but the other part of that puzzle is we have a community where very few places exist to apply those jobs\nBecause as rake Randolph admitted in a an album are all born of supervisors meeting what do we need an economic development office or we have the University of Virginia\nWell either I appreciate Rick letting us see behind the curtain because that really is the problem it's not racist\nIt's elitist it is\nIn a way the plantation economy or better suited of a more apt analogy is the mill town or the mind town\n\nWhere everybody works in the line and except for the people who make sandwiches with the people who work in the mind or more drinks were the people who work in the mind\n\nAnd that's what I'm trying to fight against is this how suffocation of our economy\n\nAnd ended up profits University of Virginia University of Virginia Jim Ryan's getting sworn in all start swearing at him now do something about it come out there and say we want to pay more for people you want to know why you'll be a love is the fact\nThat there aren't anybody out there on companies are looking for computer engineers and and each V.

treatment at UVA\nRight so a nurse navigator program at UVA and spends a several different planes on we are registered nurses E. L.\nAt UVA and spends a several different disciplines\nOn we are registered nurses and so we are um informed about the diagnosis of cancer on and we are trying to help patients to really begin to digest and process the diagnosis that they've just been given um so our goal is to inform them\nUm to also answer any questions to clarify questions I'm from the doctors that the lead in fact they've had on into also to 'em and then to get resources that they may need throughout the process\nIs a you know one of those things that you don't realize until you're in you know medical care how many questions came about a and usually never at a nine to five easy answer and timeframe so ...\nHow does a patient seek out I mean or or do they get introduced to the nurse navigator as their treatments begin do they have to seek them out is that going on because some folks haven't been there and see that happen\nRight right so um the navigator coordinators as that that term is interchangeable um at our program but a patients will meet than a immediately our with our first visit so we are I'm introduced to the patient and sometimes even before the patients come in to meet with the doctors\nOur Colleen a patient prior to that first visit\nTo give them information about what they did it on to be about ... to answer questions that they may have um about the recent biopsies and kind of begin to plant the seeds of like the information out there this evening\nI've said this time and time again that the nurse nursing in general is one of those ... you're so essential to the health care or the doctors and nurses have such precious amounts of time but you know bless you for every second do do you need more nurses in as a result you know\nKids nursing now a ... because it ... if there's a shortage of anything in healthcare it's nurses to do\nWhat you're doing because so often Europe that and that is helping patients through a any treatments that they have like you to talk about the the kind of folks who get into the nurse navigator program or beyond just being you know there to be a nurse\nAnd practice practice medicine that hospital\nRight um I think you really have to care about people\nAnd I'm really care about what's happening to that person and really understand\nUm that it's not just a diagnosis that the patient and any but this is something that is really changing a person's life you know and we were there to walk alongside too not just that piece in but also with those support if people that are also um their life our sort of you here yes\nYou know it's ... it's a hard tight rope and I still run into people coming up on five years later\nAh after my cancer treatment and people say you had cancer you'll they'll see a picture of me from twenty fourteen where I looked like lord Voldemort and there's a good Halloween reference kids um and they'll say Cho who sat I said there's me\nReally and they don't know because I didn't spend and I I felt like I spend an inordinate amount of time talking about my cancer treatments on the air but you know people come and go through the radio so I I\nBut it's it's a very hard fight to keep it from the finding that person yeah do you ... and this is where I think nurses are such a big help as well to keep our humanity from just being consumed by the illness that we're fighting\nThere are such a big help as well to keep our humanity from just being consumed by the illness that we're fighting\nAbsolutely and that's really our goal is to empower people not to keep them in a place where they weren't diagnosed but does it to empower them on to get moved through and then to thrive in their lives on that this was a season of time but it's not what it finds them absolutely\nAs you said the patient going through treatments of any kind of you'd be a ... are going to be introduced to a nurse navigator as they come into it but ... ... talk about you might be a young kid who's getting ready for school today and they're thinking about joining this pitch pitched the idea of nursing a for a few minutes here before we finish up\nTo a kid and just getting into school may be wondering what am I going to do after high school\nYeah and I think I'm nursing it's just a great opportunity on nursing is so vast and um there are\nDefinitely times to move on to the floor but\nThis is also an opportunity to um especially for um I Would say more seasoned nurses that\nUm once they have the information on and they have found the floors and they have seen many different things they can take that knowledge and use at not just with their hands but they're also I'm using it to you and power informed\nOn patients about their diagnosis and the things that they may be moving through um coming up and so I think that it's a great opportunity to use both on the knowledge that your head knowledge on but also to on use all of the knowledge that you've gained in nursing\nI was talking to the folks who run the network to work program and and I didn't realize until several years ago that nursing is considered a blue collar skilled trades you can get their start in with the BCC and started getting that way\nThat it without a whole lot of where they coal student loan debt and things like that nursing is a a ... and I've met\nDoctors heads of departments at UVA and center that started as nurses went in and grew in the industry but it's about having that empathetic heart if if you just know that you know maybe you had a\nFamily member and you just want to help them out that set empathetic heart that really is the core of of what a nurse does\nAbsolutely and that's really the core of what we do\nUm you know it's not about a paycheck on cars that will keep you there it's about caring for patients in the position that they're in and when we that you have a voice sometimes when they may not feel that they have a voice and I'm to be that for them and to be the person ... walks along side

then she came up with an adequate a proof of it\nAnd I think this would have been an opportunity I couldn't even see uh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and said to the Boston I Know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do\nYou should go out and said this has been an issue since twenty twelve who's brought up in that election campaign and I've done a test and I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American\nSo you know what I was wrong and if she had done that\nAnd then use that as soon as she still would have been able to say that the public I'm a maybe as much as three percent Native American but I was wrong to claim that ... that is I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason do advantage result financially and professionally but she could do that\nI think America what is it oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nWell here you go and she had the ... and she has the perfect um hook if he'd ancestry dot ... dot com commercial where some guys say for all my life we thought\nWe were German we went to the you know sober fast we dressed up and then we found that were Seventy percent Irish or something that I've seen a commercial out\nThere that that deals with this she doesn't do that commercial or what I mean that's the way out there it's still the I\nNot how it wasn't over here on the rise you're on the right track out imagine if she'd said hey you know that ancestry commercial the guy who thought he was Irish and they found that is these are tallying instead well guess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed they would have said well OK and we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it\nBut so few of the I Want your view on this so few politicians seem capable of saying and you know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and a no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like meat ...\nIt was wrong about that but I Apologize and are no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they say she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that one go\nYeah her her you're exactly right hurt for tax would have been to like under play it on to play what ... under play the relationship and they said ... admits she made them it may which she made a mistake and people would move on it because it again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and\nShe she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the names out there that they're going to be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God you haul boy ... ... when you say that the picture comes back to mind but the other thing or two years later Thirty years he still knows he looks like a fuel and every time I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospects but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions\nAnd we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossal lead bad this she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data in and rather than saying you\nKnow I probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it she makes a colossally bad mistake and then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nYeah what what's interesting is that you're talking I'm remembering what folks I guess is chief of staff Kelly said about her a couple of weeks ago how he she was arrogant and of course she took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah\nIt does it does you know that's a general generals used to that you know tough people you know it's a color arrogant\nAnd say that that's the key to this this thing it's the arrogance of thinking well I've got the the media behind me I'm going to do this and I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to key why she thought this would be a good idea and in doing it again it the way she did\nThere's all there's also I think uh comedy isn't or ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if you have Cory Booker wanted to be smarter because he needed to arrange for somebody else to call them Spartacus when you call yourself Spartacus doesn't go I work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's the thing and they're all all these people are trying all these Democrats who are thinking about two dozen twenty are all trying to nudge the way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump\nSee I got him I got well you don't like the ball when you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing\nYou know one sixty fourth Indian it's like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball you look stupid you know but ... but that study that twenty twenty or so focused on that you're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me this goes back to the presidency\nNow do you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean that would be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or does clear the path for for Joe Biden let's say\nIt it makes things easier for the people who are running against or but again with the uh news cycle that's so fast I mean Kanye West of the White House party seemed like years ago and there you go\nAgainst or but again with the ... news cycle that so fast me Kanye West of the White House party seemed like years ago\nTo go\nYou know so maybe you know you again but it will weaken sir and again she's going to be fighting some people who want really want the job too and they're not going to play nice\nSo she can maybe you maybe you can but again once you're once you're in that once you're in that place where you're seeing\nIs not serious which is what one thing she had going for is that she was seen as a serious thinker and now you look silly you've taken away you know some of your ... some of the thing that made you know it was a bit of war and and that's hard to hard to recover from\nYou know al I got a rap during the second but I had one other thought you know who I feel sorry for him this is Democrats who are also Native Americans real Native Americans because\nIt puts them in an incredibly awkward spot do I stay loyal to my ... my a party and because I Believe in the Democratic party I Know there are people who do and do I didn't support Elizabeth Warren or do I turn around and say I don't care she's not a real Native American she's not one of us as the Cherokee Nation said\nThe the writer continues to call her Pocahontas that continues to make a very big deal about this I just I in my mind keeps going that birth or um uh\nThe birther are saying well you know we still haven't said that\nReally support that for years and he never apologized ate it yet Obama looked for us but that was an awful\nBy joint anyway do you know there's some of us still have serious questions about President Obama's um background we still don't know much about what he took her how he got into his undergrad his graduate school or in a Harvard\nThere are many people who went to Harvard the same time he did including friends of mine when Alan routes one of them who says I was there on campus I never saw the guy so and we don't know anything about and we knew when Gore ran against Bush\nOr for the presidency we knew were Gore's grades where we knew what he took we knew what Bush's grades where we knew Bush got a better grade in science and Al Gore did we didn't we don't know anything about him\nHe was the editor of the Harvard law review but he never wrote an article for the Harvard law review so there are lots of questions about President Obama's background but you're right that's passed you know who brought this back up this week Elizabeth Warren did she decided\nThat the second point I have going on the go ahead I also listen to the dentist taker so this is a direct hit us like well it was fitness and Sebastian Gorka and ... in a\nWhile they were talking about the compassionate go a little town which I don't see it all that and then they were talking also about yes um what they say it's taking the facts but I get very much a mop a doctor for it\nOn at on his feet and they were saying that um that Donald Trump himself to clarify that take interest on sixty minutes\nThat he um did it\nOn that shooting that happened I wouldn't have made it through with it had not been for you know whether you were saying at the rally about publicity if our president actually two middle aged woman who said that the one of the main thing she remembered was laughing at her\nAnd if ... Dennis Prager and Sebastian was they didn't laugh and cause\nThe rally on her lap and why is that people who will be watching the rally to laugh at Dr Ford so that he can get ... wait a minute I say I don't do that for me as\nJoint knee joint take a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation that Dr Ford made was very manly evidence she couldn't remember
