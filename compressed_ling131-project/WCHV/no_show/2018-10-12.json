how are you\nHearing fine good how can I don't\nI was calling because I'm a fulltime and about a year left and um part time I checked my income is low and I happened to Iraq on quite a bit of credit card that over the past five years to turn a horrible spending habits\nAnd um lately I have found ... now ... loans to pay\nDown on my credit card debt and all that long our insurance will tell 'em up together right now I got about fifty\nAnd I got about fifty nine thousand dollars and buy 'em play seven student about Seventeen out that in a car loan and then about ten thousand and credit card so\nMhm [noise] so you have a question\nYes my question is I'm obviously should I keep doing\nOh okay [laughter] no you cannot use student loans to pay credit cards\nOkay do you have any advice on my income about sixteen and twenty thousand dollars a year with my major Sam I'm such just kind of on manageable right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\nUm I Will be finishing next summer\nSo buddy buddy you know kind of less than a year good so do you can tread water till then an ad no more new debt that's a victory okay then the second\nThing would be to pay the actual payments on the credit card just minimum and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight which makes it kind of amusing have leverage to pay off credit card you know how to understand and it's a really really dumb idea of how you're making a mess\nAnd so have you cut up these credit cards um I Know you haven't caught them all up [laughter] yeah I don't even found my which I don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up I'll\nStop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because they're nice club agile and out of the fact is that probably make the best pet area where I'm located\nOkay well I a little more money on another thousand dollars a month to change your life\nUh-huh\nSo that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with new\nI'm with a new job and a new career at that point um but hang on until then and\nStop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hey Naomi how are you\nBetter than I deserve thank you sure how can I help um so my husband runs the small business from home and and it hasn't been bringing in as much as it used to live for the past nine might think declining steadily and that so I'm Wondering do we used our home to quit to get another job\nYes and what's wrong with our business was dying\nI I'm not sure it did anything we used to make a combined income of two thousand a month and now both of us with the business gets down to five thousand dollar home mortgages large chunk of what we are now\nOkay I'm a little bit confused because you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nI'm about a three month [noise] are you still doing that yes okay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven yes\nNo no no no no no I was making nothing ... businesses almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm [noise] I don't know what I have to talk to and I feel like it's just competition and that he he feels like the market it's a lot of online staff of the market flooded with what you think ... um\nSo what what does he do he sells clothes on line okay\nOkay and\nIn the last year will go on so many people enter the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not they are up Ninety percent of his income\nThat yeah that appears to break and and you just get a job or needs to fix this business selling to harm and option can no because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing\nOkay and we have to feed their fix that we have to identify the problems with his business and make the changes to fix the business or we have to\nGet a job and close the business was\nI don't care if you start selling something other than close the obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well\nSo I can alert is making a hundred and fifty a year yeah anybody like three years\nYou know that ain't bad so I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing\nAnd uh it may be that the product line Asian or the ... you gotta invaded or maybe he's gotten lazy with is is CEO and he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't know I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this just isn't the hidden the right way is it\nYou know it's not\nSo I'm going to give them my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nGay and in that chapter in one chapter in the book he says that when you end something a relationship a job business whatever it is when you in something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nAnd that's when you end it right I mean if you if you're ... where the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually was quitting this time\nAnd you you know you're married to a drunk you've got to make a decision at that point right in your case in ... with this thing this thing's trending the wrong way you have to give me a logical if I knew\nYou and him when I look at this and say look at yourself in the mirror and say is there a logical reasonable good reason that says that that we can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get\nThis business working [noise] if not\nThen we have to change the business for something different or we're going to get a job the losers not work\nThanks for the rams you show [noise]\n\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal

I can stand back from that sitting here with warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it\nLike go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time but as soon as you do that money comes from work is where it comes from and I can't get enough hours woven work someplace else\nWork more work all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean our when we were going broke I too little babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it worked her mind off and well you know you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt\nBut I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective\nIs like I didn't grow up rich\nWell you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nOnly thing is just perspective is like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that angle or guy [laughter]\nIt's gonna be awful and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot\nBecause I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it 'cause you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same name a different issue is your perspective and some challenges that might be right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film script you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say what am I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's the question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I wanted to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I worked my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long will take but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way it's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't\nSee what I'm Talking about here is is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's going to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that

phone calls and emails at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven as I said\nIt's been a very busy week including one of the biggest international\nStories has been a Washington Post journalist who went missing after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd the problem is that we now believe that he's been killed and that the Saudis knew about it not only knew about it but participated in it I've invited raw by a writer sparrow to join me known worldwide as America's rabbi Middle East observer and a political analyst rabbi welcome to the program and thanks for taking the time to not\nWell thank you it's good to be with you Lars\nWhat has happened to Jamal ...\nWell I don't know any more than you know but he's not here that's for sure and how he was a\nDone away with well nobody's exactly sure although there are some indications but uh I don't think he's alive he's he's certainly not live up how he met his death that's that's a question\nAnd I'm but I'm sure that people like my pay or John Bolton I'm Jared Kushner look up to the bottom of all this\nTell me this you know we've at least heard suggestions that there's video and perhaps audiotape\nThat indicates that he was actually murdered by the Saudis we don't know and I imagine you'll say we don't know for sure but do we have really good reason to suspect that the Saudis who are you know officially our allies may have murdered this journalist\nAnd if they have how what should America answer that with\n... they may have ... we'll find out\nI'm not normally I'm not a great fan of turkey especially under aired again a minute but will will eventually find out but I'm Glad you asked the other question because there are some people that are suggesting that well if the Saudis did do this that we should have cancel all deals we have with\nTelling them ammunition and planes and the equipment and and I wouldn't go that far I mean listen they're going to get them from the Chinese will get them from the Russians and I think we have to make a distinction between\nLet's say a regime that did kill or someone that they wanted to get rid of and this happens quite often\nThat's really different than the regime that would be involved in the wholesale genocide killing people wholesale oppression\nA because if we're going to set the standards so high that any nation that through a kills this particular spy or that particular person or they want this one knocked off which happens with many many nations\nWell the American people are going to suffer because then we'll have to we won't be able to sell people defense equipment or\nFarmer quip mentor or cold you know listen to the Chinese do things to and yet we we sell them cold so it it's one thing if there is a government that's involved in the wholesale genocide well there's a certain moral principle there but um\nIf they kill someone because they consider that person to spy yet we don't like\nThey do that but we can't punish ourselves in tire industry is that I don't think that would be moral either why should a fellow who was in ... in in western Pennsylvania and the cold business why should he now\nNot have an income for his family because some internal Saudi thing or some internal Chinese thing why should they lose his job over there\nAnd rabbi might be a bit hypocritical don't you imagine that our government truth be told occasionally kills people are in various places for reasons that they may not be able to even tell the American public about\nYeah well I'm not [laughter] gonna admit to that [laughter] but but\nThe the the best of countries\nAre sometimes um when it comes to certain individual people that they feel it may have been the spy or a mole 'em or you know a lot of these things these deep deep CIA type of things that we have no way of knowing ever really\nUm so we know these things happen but like I said there's a big difference but before we punish entire\nIndustries which we always have to translate that into people there are people all throughout West Virginia and and southern\nPennsylvania northeast Pennsylvania that depend on a thriving coal business really depends on China\nOr what are we going to do put everybody out of business and then everybody in the Boeing they can sell anything so what's that going to do to a parts of the they have employees in Seattle they haven't Chicago they've got down in the Carolinas the farmers are working at all the farmers in Iowa in Kansas\nThough I I think that I was hoping you were going to ask that question because we've got to make a distinction between a country that's involved in a wholesale genocide versus all this stuff that has to do with spies and I'll tell you one more thing\nI Do feel this if this would not be a reporter and he happened to work for the Washington Post I don't know that they'd be such an outcry all over the world about this in the western media\nIn the western media it's one of their own or as opposed to let's say some businessmen was\nKnocked off for some reason we hear about it but I don't think it would rise to this level this is this is a journalist so you expect the press to make a a a very strong case at monumental cases if we're supposed to know several relations\nRabbi I'm Talking to rabbi a re a sparrow who's known as worldwide as America's rabbi he's also the author of push back reclaiming our American Judeo Christian eat those the other thing you mentioned just in passing or you you you rushed to across was the issue of pushing them into somebody else's orbit and that is if you say well we'll cut off the Saudis\nOh I'm sure that the Russians and the Chinese would love to have an opportunity to bring Saudi Arabia into their orbit and you know what I mean rather than having them be uh you know a country that at least\nA you know that they have helped us out in both of the Gulf wars and in other situations and currently they appear to be a you know they appear to be doing pretty well in in in broadening relations let's say with Israel which is is not a bad thing in the middle east we need our allies in that region don't we\nKnow that that's a very important point you make the size of the economic aspect of it and they use the word orbit if we're not going to be a selling these things to Saudi Arabia and China and Russia will will not just lose the economic part of it but that's the word orbit politically they will\nNo longer consider us and allied\nThey might allied themselves with Russia with China and what that would do to the foreign policy the necessities of America\nA that would just that could crush the world that is something that I just don't think that however drastic this is under certainly terrible for the family and I'm sure that journalists were afraid but I really wouldn't turn the world upside down over an out and who knows what it could lead to what type of brink\nOf war this could didn't realignment of powers I wouldn't do that over this one incident no\nNo and and your you know it's funny rabbi because I'm a big supporter of Israel is imagine you are as well and Iran is one of the primary forces against Israel funding all kinds of terrorist activities uh you know through Syria and other places against Israel\nI'm sure the Iranians would love to if the United states did not have this major ally in the Saudis because that means the United states' ability to push back against Iran\nOr is also going to be impeded if we don't have those allies and I'm I I look rabbi I also have questions about some of the\nSaudis role in some things that haven't been as good for the United states as well I don't see them is entirely on our side but on the other hand I'd rather have them well like Reagan used to say my ah my eighty percent a friend is not my twenty percent enemy\nOr you you can't run things that way and if you decide on absolutes you kill a journalist we cut you off altogether you're going to end up with no friends at all\n[noise] you know that's an important point I bet you you're going to hear the coming days people on the left\nWho number one wants to see Trump's foreign policy just disintegrate they want to see failure and certainly they would like Israel to lose a an important ally that they have now in Saudi Arabia but primarily they would like to see a collapse\nOf all of what President Trump is done in the last two years they'll be calling in the name of morality for a a severe cut off all relations with Saudi Arabia are no more selling them equipment\nI think that's a style and and it's something that people do and I don't honestly think they have a lot of control over it I can do the same thing sometimes I find myself down the rabbit hole because all start on tax policy I'll go to drug policy I'll go to talking about the wall and then and and if you're planning it well\nThen you may end up all the way wrapped around to something else like defense policy it happens\nThere are other times where I think at a very linear manner and I go from eight to beat to see and if I keep going all ended up and see that's what you're saying is that somebody is crazy if they don't communicate in an entirely linear way in all instances\nI Will tell you something having sat in that same office not with President Trump although I Hope to one of these days but if you've never been in the oval office you don't know how totally intimidating it can be and I would imagine even for a guy who's used to performing like Kanye West does\nThat would be an intimidating experience you're in the oval office with the president you're surrounded by what looks like about six dozen cameras and everything else and then you say\nGosh he didn't seem to be speaking from a set of notes or on a strict outline and he started at eight and ... L and then went back to see and went off dizzy and came back to ... and ... you know that that if the fact that he wasn't going in a straight line shows he's crazy\nThen unfortunately an awful lot of us are probably crazy as well there are people and I know them some people I Know who are very smart\nWho don't always talk in a linear fashion one of them is one of my best friends over forty years he's a prosecutor he's very smart\nBut he will sometimes start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so given that and don't decide that he's crazy if you sit down and do what I encourage people to do and I've said this a few times today\nListen to what he said to where he talked about the\nLack of father figures in families and that's something that's not a black or white issue it is an issue for all families if you don't have a father figure in that family and they're very many households this is not disparaging single mothers raising kids it's a tough job to do\nBut without a male figure there those kids miss out on something important and oftentimes ended up going off the path\nHe went from that to welfare and its influence\nI think an awful lot of what he said was actually very very conservative and that's why the media is going nuts on it let's go to Douglas and Douglas welcome to First Amendment friday what's on your mind\nIs how you doing quite well what's that I'm Sorry I couldn't hear less\nI say I'm doing quite well but I Want you to as my producers encourage you to do get right to your point

more and more important issue is the state's begin to legalize marijuana and I want to know how you think we are Republicans should respond to the changing climate\nI think it's a federal issue and it's still illegal federally it's a drug it travels across state lines I think it's problematic to have some states make it legal because then it gets export is a black market drug to other states that have not approved it as far as what Republicans are doing\nThe people's representatives members of Congress are not there yet to legalize pot\nThe status of it as a federal law to say well then

B.\nHonestly provocative\nHave welcome back Lars Larson choice of the\nAnd I decided to visit with my friend Dr\nHenry Miller who's a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute fees\nPublished in the popular press and its scholarly journals as well a dock it's good to have you back welcome to the program\nTo be with your Lars thank you\nBefore we get into this discussion about dark regulatory matter would you mind telling my audience what dark regulatory matter is\n[noise] yeah well you know dark matter is often a referred to as a the set of tools\nThat the so called deep state or dark state shoes to carry out their own agendas sometimes independent of the intention of Congress or the administration that they're supposed to be working for\nAnd I'm In the context of a regulatory agencies there are several kinds of of dark matter of ways that they can get around the a specified procedures for\nCarrying out their work so I'm One example is um regulatory discretion and and that means that um they have discretion within the law dictates that regulated industry or individuals must do\nAnd the the most egregious example of that with which your listeners will be familiar was a then the FBI Director ... decision\nDecision an announcement that I'm Hillary Clinton's transgressions with respect to a handling the email a private ... her private email server and so on\nDid not meet the criteria for prosecution in his opinion so that was discretion about whether there should be enforcement of the rules about the classified handling classified information um but there there are all sorts of examples in the\nIn the regulatory community so I'm\nA ... for example a marijuana possession is still a federal crime and yet it's not prosecuted at all in a amounts per individual use in states like Colorado and California so there's a good example of federal enforcement discretion better runs well\n... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it is it called the Golan agreement there was actually drawn up by Obama that effectively said\nAll right the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by these stage even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to make it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use\nBut at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and say that's what the agreement says it also says\nThe agreement is null and void at the state allows a large amounts of contraband pot to be shipped out of state into other states that have not agreed to legalize it so at least those states get some protection\nBut does some of this regulatory dark matter also happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion\nUh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to give it\nYeah well yeah and that's and that's the problem a so that I'm\nA ... FDA for example a does this all the time and it had a good example is another kind of regulatory dark matter\nIt is a pack up a little bit of a second kind of regulatory dark matter is the issuance of guidance documents or memoranda ... instead of formal role making formal role mimicking specifies\nThat there has to be an announcement on the federal register public comment consideration of public comment\nAnd then find out ... of the of the rule\nBut the agencies often get around that by issuing\nGuidance documents and then uh within the uh the guidance that they specify which is often new policy making new law making\nThat really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify caught carve outs or enforcement discretion within that and that's a sometimes at a bridge too far too much of a ton of money\nThat was never contemplated for a Fort regulatory agencies and yet they do this\nThey do this all the time some guidance is good so that for example if the uh the food truck in ... medical a law that says a there has to be a pre approval\nInspections of drug menu form a suitable manufacturing facilities\nBut uh but guidance documents can tell the industry what the nature of those are in a tablet Sherman inspections will be do they have to be announced can they be unannounced are they supposed to\nThey supposed to avoid disrupting the pharmaceutical production or how long should they left that should be the outcome on in terms of paperwork and so on so that's good\nBut uh but sometimes guidance makes brand new policy which is far beyond what anyone contemplated\nAnd it wasn't that go ahead do and\nAnd that and that brings up the sort of a conflict if you give her regular tore agencies too much of a ton of money or you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you give them too little\nYou have them unable to adjust to situations new technology is new situations that might arise\nSo what's the best way of raining it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would be\nWell the best way to rent it in it as we've discussed in other context is for Congress to exercise and performance oversight responsibilities are much better much more strictly much more conscientiously than they do\nDoc I'll tell you this this stuff drives me nuts because I guess I expect\nThat people who work in the federal government and poll of federal paycheck out of the public treasury would be people of good faith and to some extent I imagine there are plenty of people who meet that description and then there are other people who seem to think\nMy federal job is not just a great paycheck integrate pension but his mind a license to go out and fix things to be the way I think they ought to be instead of the way\nThat I'd been directed and I know that some of these people didn't like the choice of Donald Trump I frankly don't care I didn't like the choice of rock Obama\nBut I also didn't suggest that well if you didn't like Brock Obama then you should work from within whatever agency work and to try and sabotage his policies which I don't think I'd done very much\nA but people are certainly saying I'm going to sabotage the policies of ah of Donald Trump and make sure that his policies don't happen and when they do that as far as I'm concerned they're spinning in the face of the voters who approved Donald Trump whether you like him or not he was the choice of this system that we have Dr Miller thank you very much\nYou're listening I got a break but I I really appreciate the time you can read about this a doctor Miller has written about this extensively it I'd be de investors business daily and we always appreciate our visits with Dr doc thanks very much and he's at the Pacific research Institute as well\nHey I Want to remind you something about sleep we're heading into fall it is getting colder there is more rain there's more adverse whether you need your sleep so how does a great night sleep improve your performance\nHow 'bout more energy less brain fog better mood and more productivity and the news sleep number three sixty smart ... that's the kind that teen and I sleep on helps everybody from parents to pro athletes to improve their daily performance\nThrough proven quality sleep my sleep number setting is a sixty five and Tina's is it thirty five or forty or forty five\nBut that's the beauty she can change her side\nCan change my side and so many couples disagree on mattress firmness will sleep number beds let you choose your ideal firmness on each side so it's precisely right for both of you\nKnow new smart beds are so smart they since your every move and automatically adjusts all night long to keep your sleeping well\nAnd there are thousands of people do go and thousands of people who work at Google's business partners we have a have free access\nTo our profiles our emails I mean how can they resist snooping they can't and now in in a Google employees have been caught doing very bad things with our data and of course we also now have a leak showing\nAn internal discussion among Google employees about how they can fight Donald Trump's a you know immigration policy of this wasn't just from two thousand Seventeen so you know there there are people they're just people frankly and I think most dangerous yeah\nI I guess Dr I Know they're just people but for example and I I really resist the idea that you should be turned into government government controlled utilities like\nA power company or a natural gas company I don't like that idea because I didn't get very quickly run up against the first amendment and I I Want to safeguard the first amendment for both the left and the right even though I'm On the right\nBut I think and tell me if this comparison isn't isn't appropriate I have friends who are cops I don't even call them and say would you give me the criminal background on someone if it isn't public record already because I'm aware that the data systems they have access to\nWould do that one is called the law enforcement data system you can plop and Dr Robert Epstein and find out how many wants and warrants\nWants and warrants arrests and all kinds of other really salacious information might be available but Epstein her Larson or anyone else\nAnd I'm aware that there are there legal constraints on that I almost think there ought to be ethical comes friends that are good cop\nShould say that data is for law enforcement only it is not for you know to be used by you to figure out whether your girlfriend has you know an arrest from ten years ago or potential employee does unless it is public information and all those people who work in police agencies\nSometimes they break the rules to but there are tough consequences when they do they say you're not supposed to be using the lead system for anything but law enforcement it's there for a reason to catch bad guys and bad gals\nBut it's not there for you to check on your boyfriend who your girlfriend you know if we catch you're doing it it it's the end of your career is is Google prepared to be that tough on employees who who break those rules\n[noise] well see there there's a big difference because you're talking about not just ethics you're talking about uh laws and regulations you're talking about accountability to the public\nAnd the problem is with Google Facebook to there are no laws there are no regulations and there's no accountability to the public there's accountability share of shareholders or my you know my my views on this actually have changed I have to say over the years um\nI I used to start to think about regulations and things like that and uh I I my thinking has really changed\nA guarding the search engine itself for example I mean you you don't like the idea of a public utility but\nThe search engine itself cannot be in private hands that's that's an index to all knowledge and that it not only that it's it's international so that can't possibly be in private hands we can't have\nA private company determining which you know ten items out of billions and billions you're going to see and in what order you're going to see them because that's the research I Do I show the power that they have to shift thinking and opinion and votes and beliefs and purchases a you know through those kinds of\nChoices they were making the filtering in the order of information that cannot possibly be in private hands so we kind of case by case here but yeah\nWe're gonna we're gonna hit a break here in a second and I take a break can you stick through the break for a moment because I Want to ask you about how we would go about controlling who control because that'll Latin phrase who who's going to guard the guardians or you're in and do you mind sticking around for that\nI Will for you Yes sir\nThank you Dr Robert Epstein is with me he's the author of the upcoming book techno slavery the
