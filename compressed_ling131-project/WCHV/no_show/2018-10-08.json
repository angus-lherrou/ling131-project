[laughter]\nBack to the Lars Larson show glad to be with you and going to take your phone calls and emails we always like visiting with\nRegime Gabriel who's a terrorism expert and share a back for America the largest national security grassroots organization\nOh and emails and we always like visiting was regime Gabriel who's a terrorism expert and chair of act for America the largest national security grassroots organization in the country and the New York times best selling author of a new book called rise regimes it's good to have you back on the program thanks for taking on\nSome delighted to be back with you I Want\nTo know what you think of of what happened last week an over the last couple of weeks ending with the vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh as the latest member of the Supreme Court on Saturday\nWell America as we know it is being transformed before our very eyes and what we saw in the last two weeks\nI was basically a wakeup call for conservatives will love this country because the left has declared the war on the United\nStates on every flag waving and national anthem saluting veteran respecting police honoring founding fathers cherishing\nPatriotic American the conservative side did not realize that we are at war until the last two weeks and I believe last\nThat this upcoming election America's future is on the ballot people are going to vote for in America where you are guilty until proven innocent or in America where you are innocent until proven guilty\nBruce you do you think the Republicans have the guts to make that argument because you make the argument easily that this really is about whether or not the presumption is there and if not what does it mean\nBut I think I get the feeling that while the left seemingly will do almost anything to win\nThat there are a lot of conservatives who are afraid\nTo say something now we've had pleasant surprises from people like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham who was a riot but does it runs for the Republicans have the right to have the you know the the backbone to say this is what we're up against and do you want that kind of America were the kind we offer\nWell and this question has a two layer to answer on the political side of the elected officials I think after watching Lindsey Graham become a rock star overnight I think what what team did last week made him to start at the met met it defined him so he's political career\nAnd I think that I really I think you know what if you develop a backbone if you speak passionately\nIt will resonate with the people because what Lindsey Graham dead is he echoed the voice of president Donald Trump for the last two years and the way he spoke at the courage to display the moral clarity you spoke the authority you spoke with and that\nTouched a nerve and the American so I Hope that the other guy like that officials who are running this election I thinking well if I Want my spot and delight mind day in the sunshine I Need to start speaking boldly la Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham on ... the fruit side\nYou know large conservatives are not emotional people that are logical people so we are not that people are going to show up on the side of the road demonstrate\nI break glass break buildings that create a riot block highways it's not in our nature this is not what we do but it was up to this point thought well if I just go out and vote you know that that will be it I'm going to make my voice known but what what we saw in the last two weeks so conservative that activism\nGoes far beyond just voting every two years there are a lot of things you can do between the two years and I hope that that I chose conservatives how much the left is organized and they need to be involved in grassroots movements that are fighting\nOn behalf of our country I'll be perfect example with my organization at for America we saw a spike\nBecause of the cabinet where people came\nBecause they wanted to know what they can do as a fitness\nShould act for America we saw a spike because of the cabinet where people came because they wanted to know what they can do as a citizen and that's what I lay out in my book I wrote my book rise in defense of American values and freedom because\nI wanted to give people ideas and tips as to what\nThey can do to make a difference for example at the end of every chapter\nI have a section titled rise up and act or I tell people three things you can do under ten minutes and you can do them while sipping your cup of coffee in the morning and get the job was sitting in front of your computer\nThat's a great way to do it now will there also be some suggestions and therefore elected officials because Bridgette\nI Would love to see citizens turn up at public meetings and I would apply this to Republicans ... Democrats and Republicans especially\nThere are so many Republicans who won't say something even though it seems very apparent that they want to lead you to believe they are in favor of something but they don't want to say it out loud they don't want to say the words where you just said saying\nIf you believe in the presumption of innocence you have to support what we just did and if you don't then you ought to be prepared to explain to your fellow citizens while you're willing to throw somebody under the bus\nAnd what are you going to say when they come and do it to your friends or your family members\nI Need I Need the citizens to go to to elected officials and demand that they speak the truth plainly\nExactly and I and and he said perfect words because of what they did at the cabinet next they're\nComing to you know they're coming up to your son is coming after your family and and this was on display in Washington DC the last two weeks it's not going to end with Kevin now I Know it's interesting you mentioned the town hall meetings and the last chapter\nOf my ... I had a whole chapter is dedicated how citizens which people like you and me who need to get that voice out how\nTo show up the town hall meetings and how to ask questions to your elected officials I even lay out a plan how to make friends how to set a club the audience how to have a pre within questions\nHow to stand up and ask these questions how to set up your elected official to understand that you represent the majority in your community\nYou know that love wrote books\nOn how to mobilize a grassroots whether it was organizing for action by President Obama weather now indivisible look I signed up to get all these leftist organizations um emailed by the way it right now with law says you and I are speaking there are\nEighty five leftist grassroots movements operating in the country and mobilizing on the right side people are asleep so what I Hope to do and that book rise and I encourage single person who is listening to end this interview on right now to go out and get the book because it's\nA roadmap not only to how you can call your elected officials on hold their feet to the fire but also how global lies in your community to show up the city council meetings to show up to elected official town hall meetings to elected official on the spot and record their answers how to use your cell phones\nAs a tool to spread messages on your social media we on the white need to understand that and the tools that make us\nPowerful grassroots citizens participating in the future about what country and the decisions that are made on behalf that will affect us and our children for generations to come\nAnd Bridgette I ah I get frustrated when people I agree with politically will show up at a meeting they'll get the opportunity to ask you a question and then they either want to\nI uh I get frustrated when people I agree with politically will show up at a meeting they'll get the opportunity to ask you a question and then they either want to stand up and give a speech before they asked the question not ... and good sometimes the symbolism question you can ask\nWill you support new gun controls will you do something about building a wall and and then just to amplify by saying and I want a simple answer that we all understand a yes or no not something that allows you to skate out either side\nMake the question less than two sentences long preferably one less than one sentence law long because otherwise politicians are used to the non answer for the question they don't want to answer\nExactly perfect I Love the way you say that because that's exactly what they need to do you need to ask you a question and stop speaking to let it go dead silent and for\nThe elected official and giving you that the what they stand on the issue because a question like that that is very pointed and very clear they cannot beat around the Bush what they're they're they've got answered that question and make sure that your friends who are you at that town hall meeting that you're driving them to that meeting\nAre standing there with a cell phone so the elected official looking at the audience want to know that the answer is it'd be like going to be shared on social media these\nCycles of this um\nYou know it it you know and the Spanish wants to certain parts of North America and the French went to a certain parts of the recognition and the English and the Dutch went to a certain parts of North America and then we had you know various and sundry wars and\nSome people stopped coming in some people ... and some people laugh and then pretty much we had you know there's this geographic area for 'em up that became known as the Thirteen colonies and then the Thirteen original states the United states of America\nAnd then we had more people from England and then we had lots of Germans and then we had lots of Irish and then we have lots of eastern Europeans and then we have lots of southern Europeans and we had lots of Jews come over mixed in with that and he had Muslims come other mixed in with that and when everybody got here\nYes they did he did everybody go through some level of unpleasantness yeah plop of all of them but just about shovel\nAll show everybody had the opportunity to pursue\nAnd excel and and and the CI\nGreatness and you know now we have immigrants coming from the U.S across the other ocean and they're coming from they're coming from from Asia they're coming from southwest Asia\nUm they've helped build the Internet they've helped us still home computer they invented the u._s. be they've revolutionized the way that we communicate and engage in commerce and living standards are going up and up and up and up and I say hallelujah amen\nThank you very much thank you very much that that you or somebody who is in your blood lineage had the courage to pack up if they can voluntarily pack up whatever they could carry it on a boat\nCome across the ocean to a place where they they knew very few people to try and build something better because that active courage on their part they my life so much better thank you very much\nPeter offices of Newsweek contributing editor so why don't we see more politicians willing to stand up and say we do not have to dishonor Christopher Columbus in your resume from history\nAnd race in from the public square literally in New York City and Columbus Circle to be able to honor other people who came here why aren't there aren't very many proponents at all of continuing to honor those men\nBecause I think that a lot of the discussion about immigration has evolved\nAround the problems that occur when people come here\nWithout going through channels um without\n'em and and like if they come here underground they become a sub culture and they she used to assimilate and that's one one of the important things about the American immigration experience is that up until about the Nineteen seventies we held out the idea that the simulation\nWas was was uh was was the goal was the melting\nUntil about the Nineteen seventies we held out the idea that the simulation was\nWas was it was was the goal was the melting pot yep um and that it didn't matter that you spoke

civilization and a lot of salt together and then at some point people figured out gee if we can keep ethnic groups ball and I buy language\nAnd by country of origin then they're all going to need

times me\nHere's your host Sean laser\nWell ... welcome to talk live across the Virginia tech guy Angie sports network alongside coached Justin ... and my partner my name is Andrew alec credit filling in for John Glazer tonight\nHe's got a basketball fan enrichment so I Am here coming up we'll talk about the weekend that was in the game against Notre Dame of course the unveiling of coach beamer statue plus we'll look ahead to North Carolina and we bring back our favorite segment find with food but coach\nOf course let's start with Notre Dame two days removed you've gone back I'm sure you've checked out the film you thought about it you talked about it with the coaching staff or where's your head at now\nWell in regards to that game you know first of all I I just thought it was a fantastic uh atmosphere you know the ants um were active and involved in\nIt was beautiful and uh all of our players coaching staff and certainly and myself included are very thankful that we have opportunity to play and environment like that that that our kids get the support\n'cause they 'cause they do\nA said this many times but they they put a lot into this they are a lot of sacrifices that go in to these kids and their social lives and all sorts of things that um\nThat they have to do to to get to play this game and um to see him rewarded with that kind of support is really special but you know the game I I'm kinda split down the middle to be honest with you you know there's a maybe more than just half and half but there's definitely a part of me that's that's very I'm\nVery upset because I felt like oh we really had a chance to uh to do something special and um you know how to have you know had some opportunities\nThat are that we didn't capitalize on both sides of all um and then there's another part of me that that says man if those young kids that were out there playing with if they can understand\nUm you know you should be how how encouraged we should be about their future and how good they can be um you know like that was a great\nOpportunity for them and um you know we're we're striving to be as a program in you know that that type of team which I Believe with all my heart I Know we're going to be that type of team\nIn the future it's just a so you're kind of torn you know for part of your feels like he's just been punch right in the gut and the ... and you feel miserable and awful about it and the other part of me says\nMan and look at look at how some of these young guys played in this environment versus that quality of of a competition and it gets you pretty excited about what you got going on\nWhen you look at Notre Dame I mean clearly there one of the best teams in the country do you think in your mind that they are good enough to win at all or being a playoff number one and number two you think about that team they got a lot of veterans a lot of guys that have been around played the longtime different from the team two years ago so the two years from now\n... did you have that can be ... years\nI certainly think that that we certainly have those opportunities you know I mean there are just so many variables out there that either\nThat could be ... years well I certainly think that that we certainly have those opportunities you know I mean there are just so many variables out there that either speed up or\nOr um pulled back your your progress that you just can't define or give timetables too but I certainly know that will be\nUm in those positions again um you know through the guys we have so that people were recruiting uh to to be on our our team and to to come to school at Virginia Tech I don't know what the future\nHolds for Notre Dame this season um you know I I Know there's a couple of pretty good teams out there I think they have a good chance of winning the rest of their games I'll say that but\nBut I always am hesitant you know like everybody always\nAlways puts the cart before the horse particularly in college football and says it's a foregone conclusion that this this and this are going to happen and those things never happened they never do and we never learned our lesson right we always [noise]\nI'm trying to assume and and pick it too early but unless it's Alabama well they're they're pretty special ... you know but um and we'll see we'll see how it goes but certainly there there wanted this season they're one of the better teams in America\nIt was kind of a tale of two hands what did I mean the first half you kind of had it rolling and then you think about what happened right for the half one run as the formal they get to pick six and then he comes right back down to feel less than a minute orchestrated great drive you got the momentum and then half time comes out and that one play that Ninety seven yard thing just kind of took a lot of hair out\nWell I thought it was a lot of um interesting lessons learned out there you know Ryan uh we're we're moving the ball pretty well having some success and Ryan\nAre in my opinion just tried to do a little too much and got caught in between trying to throw the ball away and trying to make a play and and um they picked it up and when you know read it in for a touchdown and then we're sitting there with whatever the time was a minute a little over a minute I think\nLeft on the clock and you know you've got a quarterback making a second START I mean I Know we started at Kansas but really his second start\nThe along on national television a sold out crowd and he's just you know fumbled innocent return for touchdown\nAnd you know there's a little bit of weighing what to do their you know like how how do you approach this you know this kid has just been a part of a a fairly negative play how can we getting back to playing well and\nWhat do we need to do to finish up this half and I really felt the urge to go back out on because I just want I I just felt like we we had some things there that we were matching up in some spots really well\nBut I wanted to feel good about Ryan and Ryan kind of collective himself and\nYou know I just tried to explain to him quickly and you know Ryan you don't have to put a Cape on your back and fly around the stadium and\nAnd make three guys missing and throw it Dan Marino post route across the middle of the field just play within the system is relax a little bit and if it's there let's take it so we kind of went out that that next driving\nAnd just packed away a little bit and the guy that role in pretty well and he was just on the money\nUh drove down there to to score and that's been a little bit of his story you know is either been looked like\nYou know or made a mistake or two and\nUm you know going into half a we we got those seven points back so to speak and\nA really good but knew it was going to be a heck of a bottle and we had um pinned down they're deep and and um you know we we just we were our backside linebacker was a little slow getting over the top and they got to the safety in the corner didn't fold and to make the tackle and\nOnce I got I got in the open field about ... to the hell heck of a job trying to catch him [noise]\nAnd they got to the safety in the corner didn't fold end to make the tackle and once I got in the open field about ... to the hell heck of a job trying to catch him you know because he could run now and a house\nGains is running down the alternative any riots you\nYeah so ah but yeah I mean we had them back up and you know it was pretty big play now\nYou talked about Ryan will sell it to go back to him for a second is it extra hard for him to settle down because of the arm strength he has like he knows he can make a lot of these throws does that make it that much more challenging terrain him back well he does have a little bit of that\nWhat does that will Rogers I never met a man I didn't like and that's like Ryan has never met a throw he couldn't make you know like he can he's got so much um you know God given ability they're throwing the football that there are some place that he makes that you're like holy cow and then there's some place where you're like\nWhoa wait a minute [laughter] you know and you know that's part of it but that's that's playing that position I mean that's true\nFor the guys that are that are making twenty million dollars a year or two I mean they have to wipe walk that tight rope of making plays and also not hurting the football team and invariably they're going to be some place that that hurt the football team you just hope that you make enough along the way that that you that\nBalances out there there's such a fine line between making plays and making mistakes and obviously it's a thin line but you think about the other things he's been asked to do I mean the quarterbacks counted the natural leader and he's had to kind of assumed that too and his command of the huddle and all the guys got to listen to him is that been difficult for him know he's done a good\nYou know like two to [laughter] it just seems a little bit over the top to me like I'm not quite a fair represent jumping up and what what\nCan happen or what can help you get to that point where you want to be you had what a hundred and eight recruits hear something like that some of the best of the best just talk about how that went how it was\n... I mean the kids that are a wonderful time or staff did a great job with them we solicited a lot of help because of the numbers were humongous\nAre trying to get the kids a glimpse of Virginia Tech and and they got to see a fantastic example of a young football team out there fighting scratching and clawing\nOr to try and beat off beat a a really good um top five or six football team in front of a unbelievable crowd that showed fantastic support and um you know can be anything but positive just talk a little bit but not to interrupt and they're not your ...\nWhen you get that situation like that what happens just for the people what happens like after the game and Sunday do you meet with some of those kids again\nThere are some of them go to the game so late so stay the night so uh what meetings with him the next day like as soon as we get off the bus on ... and we walk and boom it is an hour and Fifteen like at some point the players start going out and warming up and as the coaches players enter the field\nThey're excused from recruiting to go handled their players but as soon as you walk in the door which changed our closest fest you can get down there and it's an hour and Fifteen minutes of\nOr sometimes earn thirty minutes of of recruiting and then um of course we have some of us a staff that handles them when we're not there that helps us\nAnd then um you know many of them stayed an item and come back up some of them stayed the night and came up and washed practice Sunday so they got a chance to see us workout and us actually coach and all of us were so\nMuch more to come on tech talk live with coach went say we continue our conversations across the Virginia tech guy into sports network after this\nHave you received a DUI or other trapped related within the where the heck is he on certain you're official Auburn we have a team that is with you every step of the way\nThey have the experience that comes along with having to spend more than thirty thousand criminal and traffic cases statewide and the expertise to get the job done call anytime they are aiming for your free consultation or complementary copy of my book don't forget to ask us about our free appeal guaranteed to learn how we can help solve your problem ...

third quarter when it's kind of they're kind of came out how do you handle that how do you get the gas back on track is that one of the tougher\nParts of your job do you know the notion of like having a brief team meeting is out the window sure you know you don't have a chance to like\nYou have to train them for those moments beforehand like because you don't get a chance to to set everybody down on a need like we do at the end the practice I'm taking a helmet off and give him a talk I mean it's the kickoff return units on the officers back on you gotta get get going to try and recapture\nThat momentum now we try and stimulate similar things with sudden changes and momentum swings in situational work and all this stuff and we and we try to simulate things like that\nIn um our offseason program in terms of you know you know we think we're doing well but no this this has changed and you've got to do it this way or whatever it is just to try and keep them on their toes so um you know we've been a good responding team and I I Would anticipate that we'll continue because\nUm because we do train them like that\nTalk about some of the little things that happened in that game like when you get that great interception and then he falls down little thing like that then you've got the touchdown call back because of the penalty and little things like that in the third goal what happened on the third and goal when there was the collusion there\nAre all Ryan is under center and the over rotated\nIs stepping manage just bad but the um [noise] they are I mean it's pretty simple let me [laughter] but um you know the the the penalty is a penalty or ... but\nGolly it's a hard one to slow you know the guys not even at the point of attack you're not even doing anything it's like he was you know we're all those guys so hard about it\nA hard one to swallow you know the guys not even at the point of attack you're not even doing anything it's like he was you know we're on those guys so hard about chasing the ball like if you watch us\nPlay on both sides of all we wanted to chase the football ... good things happen when you're around the ball or football ends up on the ground you can recover so we're all of them so hard and I believe watching the film a hundred times\nLike he turns to look and sees it the ball is if people are starting to go that way and Stearns to do training to do chase the ball and he was you know our yard probably are too\nFar down the field and it was unfortunately you have for you for it to get called like that I get it like I understand the whole Arpaio run past conflict deal or live in her down feeling they're throwing the ball that wasn't this case this was just a guy song during\nJust still are all on the same page can you explain to us exactly what the letter of the law is exactly how far he can or can't be down field and when and all those sort of thing so we're on the same pay us three yards\nWhen the balls released so he can be three years then be over three yards from the balls released so you know and usually you know [noise]\nBecause of the run past deal it is a rule that should be enforced they've talked about moving it to one yard my ideal is they have\nIt's hard enough to enforce anyway it's like me eating easier or harder to enforce it on your order three yard if you think about it the guys watching the line of scrimmage he's not watching when the ball's thrown it's a very difficult road and force but there has been a point of emphasis rightfully so because some office of\nGuys are getting away with murder so to speak in terms of live and getting down field and throwing the ball so I mean I get the call I mean you can't complain about it it's the rule is just was kind of an unfortunate they're like I'm not really upset with the guy that had the nerve either like he was\nDoing where we ask them to do the bottom line was a great call though well as well actually one of those yet there's those calls that are great you know they they're the ones that work and it was well executed and the kids kids that a good job with it and they know that we're we're not afraid to to pull the trigger on some of those and some of them were better than others but\nUm that one sure was was pretty until we sell flag Terry sweetly and his kickoff return yeah really proud of terrorists he's carving out a role in this damn you know I just think he's going to continue to get better he's a guy that we felt like it was a developmental guy since the very beginning\nUm and I I think he's going to continue as he goes through time here he's only a freshman I'm you know to to get stronger and bigger and continue to to play a bigger role as we go for he's got good vision\nOr back there and you know has a little bit of
