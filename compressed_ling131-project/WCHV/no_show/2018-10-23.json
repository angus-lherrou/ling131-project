eye on that invasion caravan that is making its way north through Mexico on its way to the U.S border and there are questions perhaps unanswerable at this point\nWho's paying the cost for this massive

sounds like common sense to me\nAnd yet these days you may have to actually defined it they series of decisions by the Obama administration change that including education health care and recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the gender that was assigned at birth\nOf course most of us find that a ridiculous definition now\nI'm not saying that you can't wear any kind of clothing you want to wear wear whatever you want to make your hair look whatever way you want whatever floats your boat you want to wear makeup fine you don't want to wear makeup find your

that giant caravan\nThat is heading toward America's border and it's full of people who have some have burned American flags waved to their own flags from the home countries there from an indicator day desire to come into the United states and not necessarily do it legally either they called themselves refugees\nBut you have to remember that refugee has a specific meaning in the law and I've asked John's mirror to join in\nThey called themselves refugees but you have to remember that refugee has a specific meaning in the law and I've asked John's mirror to join his senior editor at the stream and author of the new politically incorrect guide to immigration John good to have you back on\nBank you couldn't it be although this is a very grim occasion it is until me one this is\nAn invasion I couldn't keep the doors let's just call it what it is these people are no more refugees than Cortez and his soldiers were when they arrived in Mexico\nOr not I would agree with you yeah they're not asking\nPermission to come into our country because they're genuine refugees first of all refugees someone who is persecuted by his government the way Jews were persecuted by Nazi Germany and they sell to the United states\nAnd tragically France Franklin Roosevelt ... away those Jews on those boats people and like you know it would end up like Anne Frank we're not waving Nazi flags they will not screaming about how they're going to carry out on a\nNazi German traditions and culture\nIn the United states okay what when you see people claiming ... and they're waving the flag of the country that allegedly persecute them maybe it's time to be suspicious\nAnd by the way they don't fit the asylum seeker label either do that\nNo no ... on either of those cats they should stay in the first safe country they reach now of course they were perfectly safe in Honduras or wherever they came from but they're pretending they were at the moment they got to Mexico they should apply for for asylum\nOr refugee status and they're not doing it to let a single one of these people not one\nInto this country I don't care if we have to\nSet the Rio Grande on fire the way the Cuyahoga caught fire in the seventies this cat on at\nNight agree with you because John we're going to get more of this and you know what probably set this off most recently and tell me if I'm wrong about this\nDrew Donald Trump adopted a zero tolerance policy and the Democrats treated like a hobby horse and said no you can't do that because you're separating parents from children many of the adults were not the parents of those children writing of them had no connection at all we know that\nBecause some of them some of the parents some of the adults I should say we're told you you can go home do you want to take your kids with you know I'm leaving them here\nWell that's because they weren't really connected they were probably assisting in trafficking those kids but the right in\nIn a child pornography or slave labor and the Obama administration ... or let ten thousand kids go with the people who claimed to be their parents and they found the working a slave labor as an egg factories and I in Idaho\nSo the bottom line is is is that these people will try to cross the border illegally and I've had people saying well you know they can't do this are too big a group I think they're planning to overwhelm the border patrol knowing that\nYou know I mean we see this on a smaller scale do we have fifty illegals encounter a half a dozen border patrol agents those agents may be able to stop half a dozen people or four dozen people\nBut many of them get right on by so if you swarmed the border with seven thousand or who knows maybe ten thousand because this thing has been growing like crazy over the last week or so it went from one thousand four thousand announce seven and\nMay be headed for ten they get to the border and their ten thousand strong\nHow in the world are you going to stop them short of using the option that President Trump says he will use and that's the military\nOh absolutely\nTen thousand strong how in the world are you going to stop them short of using the option that President Trump says he will use and that's the military\nOh absolutely we should use the military and we should we hit a drone flying over them now dropping leaflets telling them that they're not welcome in as they approached the border we should have maybe drone spraying with Cathy or something and these people need to be the ... they need to know that we will use what ever force is necessary\nIncluding deadly force if they if they attack our border guards and kill them if they trampled then\nThen the military will use violent force this is an invasion of our country by foreign mop if we have on this the entire population of Latin America is going to walk across the land bridge into the United states and then the entire\nLarge parts of the population of the Muslim world will get on boats the way they are doing in the Mediterranean they will sales in the United states\nYou we will be inundated it will be over ... is an existential crisis in the United states of\nAmerica and by the way it is we want exist or not\nYou know John these are not all Hondurans are Guatemalans or Mexicans they're finding apparently there are people there from Bangladesh which is another uh apparently in the first the first nine ten months of this year we've seen six hundred Bangladeshis\nCross into the United states over those our southern border so they they were\nThere's long been relating operation relationship between al ... who did the nine eleven attacks and Central American cartels like MS their team\nSo that means that they've seen this is the way to get in don't try to sneak in through a regular port of entry\nFly into South America Central America come north on buses or whatever where you can find your way north\nDid pass the borders and then just enter the United states surreptitiously across a wide open border maybe we should take some of the tens of millions that we're going to take away from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador as punishment for them not helping us with this problem and spend it on building a wall\nWe absolutely have to build we need to build a wall electrify it and set it on fire and this is this is our wages and it's being shunned up just in time for the elections and I think I Know why I mean there are activists walking around handing out money organizing buses and trucks down there\nThis is not a spontaneous movement is no political ... and it's got your sources\nGreasy fingerprints all over it but people say well why why would they do this so close to the election don't they realize it's going to help the Republicans they don't think it will they think Trump will cave the way he caved over separating families and I think if they can get across the border he will cave and the Republican base will be so depressed\nDiscussing spirited that they won't turn out to vote\nNo but but you know John over the weekend I tweeted out that when I saw the video of this crowd coming up to the gates leaving Guatemala and going across the bridge in New Mexico and they simply burst through the gates ... you know rip them down and went on through\nAnd then the crowded that bridge wall you know from edge to edge with with illegal aliens or future I mean they weren't crossing into Mexico legally so I think I could still called them illegal aliens because they weren't entering through any kind of process I said this is the best the ad for Donald Trump's wall but I've seen in a long time\nBut you're right if the Democrats have calculated if we force the president to threaten to use the military and then he doesn't and they cross in\n... Republicans and conservatives will be demoralized by that\nAbsolutely but if they are yeah if they break\nRepublicans and conservatives will be a demoralized by that absolutely but if if they are yeah\nIf they break down our fences and march onto a bridge like that we need to blow up the Brits before they get to it they if they escalate we escalate well we had a I mean I Would try to avoid casually blow it up before they reach it they can't be allowing\nYou clarified that because you know I said well they get to it yeah because they're not foreign combatants but I Would say we use everything we can and what is the United states military I mean our military is great winning wars but they also know how to guard a perimeter\nAnd if you were boarding I'm an artist at the perimeter is now the edge of our country make sure nobody comes in I think we were\nStarting the borders of Afghanistan why can't we guard the border to the United states I mean really a Donald Trump aides to open a military bases\nAll along our southern border use eminent domain if necessary and use use federal money to link them by a by affect it by a border fence if he can't\nBut they failed to remember that there had been assassination attempts and there are people that will tag along with the masses when they're putting a or a variety of yelling and screaming that just so they can get closer to the Kennedy we know that John Hinckley junior was very very close to president\nBefore he actually shot George Wallace was shot by an assassin who was yelling at people in the crowd that they were cheering loudly enough for George Wallace\nSo what people don't understand when they sit there and say well why did you act\nThis why why did you move away or run away or not address these people who are approaching you are in public and screaming at you like what it is with good reason you have no idea what their motivations are at motivations of the main people in the protest maybe honorable if you can call them honorable may be disrespectful but they're they don't need any harm\nBut the public officials had to be concerned about others can they be tagging along with the same thing with law enforcement what somebody approaches a vehicle\nThe officer has no idea if that person is going to ask directions or if that person is trying to get close to them or for that purpose we've seen a tax on law enforcement where two or three people were saying hey why don't you get away from that guy is not you know given the past don't arrest them and then someone comes up based on the outs for being distracted and physically attacked them\nYou know I've seen that myself land so I told you I used to go on a lot of ride along and I'd I'd have officers who say watch\nIf we're going on are arrested for shoplifting or had a convenience store and in particular neighborhoods we'd have a crowd of fifty people standing round who's very quickly and you don't know which ones are just looking lose and which ones are potentially dangerous to the officer but there was a lot of shouting\nAnd then more recently we've seen a tax on General Mattis and others you know attempts to take their lives or rice and it's as though there's just a whole you know sort of spectrum of different ways that anybody in a forty or or a political position\nIs is being attacked a police officer is part of that he's where the rubber meets the road you know when it comes to government policy we have laws we have to have men and women in uniform moon force them and now they're being viewed as as a potential targeted\nBy people who have some kind of beef either against society or against the laws or against the enforcement of laws\nYeah and you know we heard a there's a video out you can find and I I tend not to talk about these people there's only ... anymore airplay but there's a video out as a woman is questioned about a kitten the ... shot a cop and she just looks at the ...\nYou know these are the officers that are going into communities that other people wouldn't go to on a bet with all of their doors locked in their windows rolled up\nAnd you know they're going in there and trying to make a difference or they just responding to calls from health for help from law abiding citizens that live there that you know are trying to have their kids late on a school bus without somebody try selling drugs\nYou know and and how do we get on top of that if the whole community is so distrustful and the cops\nThat they take that attitude that if a cop was shot so what I mean that that you know I Want the cops to go home alive every single night but I also want them to be able to go into a community and get real communication that might help them find the person who's ... you know child trafficking or the person who's selling dope in their community\nAnd that kind of attitude from members of the community is just not helpful at all\nSo it's not and the way that you combat it is you start telling the story of all the good things officers do every day ah we see it all the time and and\nSo it's not in the way that you combat it is you start telling the story of all the good things officers do every day\nAh we see it all the time and and you have to yell louder people say well you know I talked about what happened no you need to yell out or if there's an officer that does something in your community that benefit everybody put it on every social media platform you could imagine\nCall the news until they\nDo a story about it and there's they they're doing things everyday law enforcement officers do things every day that are not in their job description\n[noise] just to protect people you know we had floods in Austin we had a terrible hurricane that came through Georgia and Florida and you can find reports of officer is going to work when their houses didn't exist as a matter of fact there's a company called relentless to enter in Texas the great company\nThey found out that officer some of them their uniforms just completely blew away so they started printing T shirts that said police officer\nSo they would have some way to patrol the communities you know while their families have been shipped out and evacuated they're still staying in the community to protect the people that are strangers to them\nLance is the author of winning cops kill and blue news the profits

D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nHi Dave I'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got a B that three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through at the you know we coordinated it thank you and yeah and my ... when the ten percent\nBut I hear you on your show the twenty percent we'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then and one of those too so I'm just wondering what\nWhat makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nA good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage okay not one All right uh the in when somebody's buying a second home\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you're gonna put down twenty percent on your second because you got the equity coming out of the first one\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second um 'cause you got the equity coming out of the first of all\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. fans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money on the foreclosure\nThere's four so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage he got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference versus ten percent\nAnd so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get you know my on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the ... when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the more get from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared with conservative and\nNow it doesn't make a difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I'll point out then count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're the higher the home prices markets you were in the more difficult this discussion because I wanted to get all the way down to ... percent I Am not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have that stay that way I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan\nI mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you right so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep choking on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous\nGet that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWithin appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PMS dropped so you're not doing PM African one years 'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it\nBut it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that are in tune with\nBeing smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty\nAnd Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so\nI'm twenty five I ah I have I've done pretty well for myself uh I have a dilemma though my killing healers cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to s R T H model what the\nBig game in it and it's a hot yes I paid\nWell below Kelley Blue book value and I have about five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening you go through your baby steps\nIt's going to be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my merged based on\nWhat is your ... your car worth\nA private market is twenty three who I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars best ... uh I have no credit card debt\nMhm are you single I'm Single and what's your income\nBy income is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car that's my only debt and how much do you want to\nAh oh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one said\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year or maybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that ... ... yeah I can I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand an ear making fifty grand if you're single\n...

we have Scott are Neal just yet\nJust can we have All right\nWell we'll we'll take you can and look what we were busy talking here the fact that after dropping three of four and then in the home stand you know pretty\nYou know relatively modest homes down as far as the capitals high expectations are concerned a nice way to start the road trip here with the exception maybe the first few minutes of the second period relatively complete effort here tonight in game one of the western rosy\nYeah I think it was a great road in for the caps you know there was a couple of moments like yourself a second fair and being a second term but other than that I mean even a third when they give up that quick one or they get that power play back in the pot and other water kind of take the right side of them so to me it was a [noise] ah I thought it was a good road period a great way to start a long trip\nAnd usually a heart trip for anybody coming out west no matter where you go but they find a way to get it done the big guys get it done a lot of the fourth line played a a an unbelievable to me\nOr where you go but they find a way to get it done the big guys get it done a lot of the fourth line played a a an unbelievable to me in a ... game of the year and it's that's a sign of things to come up pretty good [noise]\nAnd John Carlson where the ball and to assist tonight then again played north of twenty six minutes he continues to play a big ... minutes even as far as he's concerned he is the second most in the lead now behind only ... dowdy we saw him play very well last year and a contract theories comeback this season sort of picked up right where he left off\nWhat your opinion has allowed him to maintain that level of play and is this even Nate games in perhaps better than we saw last year and what was arguably his best seasons today\nWell he's feeler there is no doubt about it off and somebody jumping in on the on that goal he got on his horse these way back in his own zone he gets on his horse beautiful pass by Ron I'm but a John Carlson made that all play by driving in the ... not stopping so\nHe's got a ton of confidence that he's ready to go um I think there's disguise the limit right now the way this power plays clicking too you know he's going to have the points in there and\nUm I just like to waste plane offensively and he's he's him and his partner get me to do in a good job he trusts kept me going to move up and you trust them to be there and they're figuring out so at the chemistry between those two guys is allowing him to do his thing\nI touched on the power play another two goals tonight Alex Ovechkin weighing in on the power play which has been outstanding for the last decade maybe this year even taking it to another level\nYeah I think a a\nR successes are understanding what's left to do and all through all those years ah\nOur ... at a\nDon't change a lot and you know we\nWent on automatic like who's going to\nHalf four different teams just it's hard to guess was going to take a shot in the auto show Carly or a ... you know we should all the places a lot and ah you know uh\n[noise] one of ... stuff\nAlready touched on all the different options as far as being able to shoot nice to see of getting who's ... trigger happy this year's fifth power play goal already an eight games and that one time or he had from the right face on circle can they cannot sort of basically shadow lean all eyes on Alex Ovechkin end up getting ... thank you very much I'll take care of the rest\nThey exactly you know and you and can you blame them you know not so you pick your boys you just can't if he can continue to follow the puck like that you know as John mentioned the Tampa Bay kind of\nA lightning a power play it just makes it even more potent because you know how you get a game plan against that we're going to take away going to take their sides away the middle of a wide open I take one side the other side I mean these guys are as I can just said they know each other is gonna be and that's a key part of it so\nUh so much continuity between the five of them they know they get mixed up and get moving around um it to me it's just to it's almost impossible to stop I mean they are the only stop there can stop themselves\nAnd ... with the five power play goals he had I put this in air quotes he had only seven power play goals all of last season so already just touche I imagined that total but\nIt's in the number is still alive I mean the shots on gold from ... if there was an area that the cap said that leads to offensive Lee encouraged him to do maybe a little bit more of its shoot the puck you know provide a little bit of deceitful ... the opposition honesty is not always going to dish it off\nEven strength or on the power play his ability to shoot in his um you know his knack now for shooting a little bit more often has been a nice encouraging trend in your number five yeah it has it not only you\nKnow they are encouraging them but it only helps him over more because now he's not a one dimensional player in his lot easier ... you know is leaving there on the side ... leave him down by the goal line\nEncouraging them but it only helps him over more because now he's not a one dimensional player needs a lot easier ... you know is leaving there on the side ... leave him down by the goal line just look for the past 'cause that's what he's going to do now you don't you know as a penalty kill you don't know what is going to do or five on five you have no idea so he's keeping if the defense honest and\nI think that's a nice you know you you have to do that once in a while 'cause that was so much film these days and so much technology they know ever you know the ...\nWhat what players are going to do what they're not going to do and certain situations is nice to throw a wrinkle in there once in a while and keep them guessing\nMan how's this for coming full circle here it was in two thousand six in Vancouver at Rogers Arena\nAlex Ovechkin announces the capitals drowned selection of Nicholas back some and tonight and the very same building Bactrim becomes the first player from that draft class with six hundred careers is\nFitting Lee doing it on an Alex Ovechkin power play tally but another very quietly another milestone for Nick ... six hundred if this first ... class first in franchise history\nThree more system the night for ... another impressive night from Nineteen\nOh I just his whole career is just so consistent I mean the shows up all the time and ah he just does this work you know it all looking for any accolades delicate rain limelight it just goes up there and does this work and he is so good I mean his eye wizard out there and it had been there for a long time six hundred assist a lot of assess\nAnd uh you know like you said fitting that Ovechkin store was about ... many of those have been but uh he's got many more in them and they just a treat to watch\nAnd finally Ken you touched on it in Pasadena earlier but the play of the fourth line tonight on Nick Dowd a very active tonight ... trigger happy a little bit arguably his best game of the season and asking rounding out the outlined but\nThey were out there and some key situations late in the first period late in the second periods strong in the Ford check a little bit from that trio and nice to see the ... and was able to an extent on through allow for lines tonight\nWell yeah you have to if you want to play at a high high philosophy game any beyond everybody in every every all over the place you're on the road you don't get the matchup you want all the time\nYou have to have some production I thought that fourth line was outstanding tonight\nA very ... like I said his best game you're asking his best games have you been here um you know so to me if you if you have that luxury that you can put your fourth line and not worried about getting mixed matching them throwing somebody out you're worried about it uh it just key for for a coach so\nA good for them or they're going to need a down the road you know next couple of games that are going to play a couple of good

those moments where where you if you feel like oh maybe I shouldn't have been so angry about that but anyway uh so let's start out with something that I I don't think a lot of people do let me start with the police were Denver and I disagree\n\nSo the issue of the pipeline came up um and this was first Denver's answer then I'm going to play ... Leslie Coburn answer and who\nAre some people know me on this one so uh\n[noise] for me I'm a critical infrastructure expert in the department of defense that's what I Do if anybody wants to talk about it afterward I'm happy to against a CPA in the MVP the reason I as I 'cause I always err on the side of liberty I also think that there can be I think there can be agreements on protecting private property and grow in critical infrastructure an autonomous infrastructure ...\nLooking at what we have like HR sixteen eighty nine which was a bipartisan bill that Republicans and Democrats who made it much more difficult for private companies to take public property to public or private property to public condemnation just for economic gain here's what you got to prove to me\nYou have to prove that private property trumps the economic development is somebody going through there you have to prove to me that's not just money grab for a company you have to prove to me that our most cherished right at private property will always be\nAlways be protected some near and dear to my heart um if we want to talk about it afterwards we can because the red lights on\nWhen we you will have heard me properly and plenty of occasions to talk about the Atlantic coast pipeline I and how what is being portrayed as a property rights issue is under property rights issue to be driven by the Russians the same rushing you know people who are all of a sudden getting charged with\nQuote manipulating elections which are still trying to find the u._s. code is a crime\nUm by the way you commit fraud you go out there and say hey I'm jak ah and I'm your best buddy and I have twenty of your friends and we all agree against the pipeline I mean that's a con job\n\nIn Facebook should be against it because to me that makes Facebook or bad Twitter if you allow people to create phoney baloney plastic banana you know anything you wanted anonymous egg a avatar accounts just a\nTorch things and to say whatever you want a lot of people don't buy what they see on Facebook and Twitter because most of it is\n... job slick willy misrepresentation anyway it's all campaigning\n... why I really spend so little time on Facebook I I use it to promote stuff we're doing you know so mainly you you have an entree to it I Hope you don't spend much that much time do you get a little alerts from\nPeople I Know\nBut what do you know is being portrayed as a property rights issue isn't a property rights issue\nAnd the next time the Sierra Club is in bad backing\nSomebody's right to own private property and to be sovereign on their private property will be the first but but listened allegedly Coburn answer on that\nAnd the ... the pipelines that pipelines do not keep the lights on in Virginia there and LA unnecessary that going through a sustainable farms\nOr by the way that that point was also brought up by Jennifer Lewis that oh this this natural gas won't be going to Virginians\nArms up by the way that that point was also brought up by Jennifer Lewis said oh this this natural gas won't be going to Virginians so if the natural gas pipeline was\nEnding terminating an Buckingham county in we were going to run some of the Buckingham county power plant sonnet there'd be okay\nThat going to have sections of the ... district where um we have wonderful thriving businesses and they're going to the plan is that they will go through communities like union held in Buckingham which is an historic African American Friedman community\nWhich apparently is the only community it's going through because every time the subject comes up she goes back to this uh ... and never accused Democrats of playing the race card and then if you knew\nWhere there will be a giant compressor station stealing toxic chemicals and venting methane and sounding like a diesel locomotive twenty four seven\nThis pipeline will leak as much methane as the equivalent the greenhouse equivalent uh forty six coal fired plants\nThey will go to class a thousand waterways including the James and they leak into those waterways\nThis is not protecting Virginians so if you take what she was saying there at face\nValue go oh my God why would you understand that this is the department of environmental protection under Terry McAuliffe that said this was okay this wasn't some moustache she owed\nTop hat wearing stove pipe smoking Republican that was okay this this was Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam that have okay the pipeline and when she rattles those statements off\nShe's polling numbers just out of thin air\n\nThose numbers are those statistics borderline statistics those rhetorical statistics or pull down out of if a pipe bursts that's what happens theoretically because we haven't had one burst yet\nBut it worked for the argument so I just figure just just for giggles we would begin this with a subject that I\nDisagree with both of them on and that is the Atlantic coast pipelines so we'll

Robert Mueller was tossed out of court or was told that are either he\nOr fish or cut bait started showing some sort of criminal activity or get out of the courtroom because uh so far all he can say

particular election Gore\nRight and I have a I have ... and I got arrested by the eyes for\nI Am glad lay election\nBut that's what it would scare me and hearing this because I thought about something

reform which when the Democrats says it means the government will choose who gets to run for office because they will give you the money to do it but I also find that all of this stuff adds together that the government will get to choose\nWho and how you hear about candidates for office\nAnd and I can't see how there's anything American about that or if anything it's it's the most scary perversion of a of a a social ... socialized communist style government where we're going to tell you who your two candidates are and then you write in between them\nGo\nThat's you know and so I mean it scares me when they started talking about campaign finance reform while they're also talking about Russian collusion or inclusion in general not even just Russian per se I Am because to me this is setting up a premise that they were going to be able to come\nAbout Russian collusion or collusion in general not even just rushing per se I Am because to me this is setting up a premise that they

story that when we went in to see Trump when he called us and we did not have a positive opinion of Donald Trump I thought he was kind of a blowhard I thought he was kind of a show man I thought his presidency was just a publicity stunt\nAnd we went into that Rob span of over an hour with them just just a ... Larry Kudlow and I and and a Trump and we were just blown away by the guy he is you know he's really very charming and and very uh\nYou know he's one of the most interesting people I've ever met in my life and we had a great conversation with them and asked us if we would we would uh you know work with them on his economic plan and be a senior economic advisors and ... and Joe is he's our ... how it got to say no to\n[laughter] ... so we got involved and it was what what a wild\nRide it's been and and you know as I said you know it'd be drew these ideas up on the chalk board and to see how they're working now has been an incredible thing and and I saw the president you days ago at one of the a Rose Garden ceremony she had for the trade deal and\nYou know I just had a a minute or two to chat with them and he just said you know see this is working better than we even\nYou know and it's absolutely\nIll and you know I just had a a minute or two to chat with them and he just said you know Steve this is working better than we even thought you know\nAnd it's absolutely true is that when when you look at it now just like I said I think it had to be an outsider because I think at some point soon to know how well you have already that was\nYour question about you know could anyone else have done this\nYou know I think what may Trump you know first of all I think what got him elected was that he was as a businessman Joe you're exactly right that he's not a politician you know and he he doesn't act like a politician you know he he's he says what he means it means what he says and\nYou know sometimes we roll our eyes when he says things he's not politically correct that you know one of the lessons of the book by the way is that uh you always have to um you know every audience I talked to I always tell them if you want to understand Donald Trump watch what he does don't listen to\nWhat he says ... seats that's crazy things we all know that ... you know as I say some guys were just she just shut up\nWell I think that his results\nAnd and the fact that he's done so such amazing things for the economy and such a short period of time by the way every economist wheat tangled with you know all these liberal economist Paul Krugman Larry Summers and then it seems like the entire economic faculty at Harvard\nThey all said this is never going to work ... going to affect the great depression is why the American people and he says we can get three percent growth I mean if the ... I couldn't get a hundred percent growth hours Trump and do it and you know here we are a year or two in two years later we got four percent raw\nRight and and we're coming back to a place where you know and this is something I've told my listeners I grew up in New York and I remember the first time Donald Trump of appeared on the evening news news you're much younger but pretty much saying the same things I just wanted to build an office building in Manhattan I think renovate a hotel\nAnd was warring with Ed Koch over it and and I even then\nYou you had to realize that what the press was telling you Donald Trump said\nDifferent from what Donald cat actually said the first place I think that's where all those rallies during the campaign were impactful because you get ten thousand people in the room listening to him and then they'd go home and read the paper the next morning and say well that's not what he said that's patently you don't miss quoting him\nAnd that's where I think a lot of the fake news stuff comes from so you don't even ... you an art we're going into the room thinking was based on the media's interpretation of what Donald Trump said a rather than you know what Donald Trump actually said in this one I always told my listeners was don't\nDon't let them tell you he's here in Charlottesville he bought a he bought a mention\nA and everyone said don't let Donald Trump by the album are all house because he'll he'll put you on a slot machines in it and there'll be linoleum cart and now it's considered one of the top five destination bed and breakfast in the world so yeah it's that's the kind of thing\nSo that way 'cause that's what I think really you know again I think it's the reason Trump won the election and and it wasn't about you know people are voting Republican or Democrat here I mean Trump didn't run as a conventional Republican I don't some of his ideas\nOn trade and and and uh issues like that even more you know like Bernie Sanders that as a Republican but what he did I think the reason people were willing to take this is a risk in this gamble with Trump because there was a gamble you didn't know how this week it was going to turn our people were\nFed up with regular you know a professional politicians that's why you know I always said one thing that people did not want in two thousand sixteen there were two things people did not macho you know what they were\nA politicians in more politicians have well\nThey didn't want another Bush and they didn't want another Clinton\nAnd the other Republicans and Democrats found that out powered way uh but you know people wanted a change they want to and kids businessman philosophy he used to say to me like\nThey both Republicans and Democrats found that out Paraguay uh but you know people wanted a change they want to end but kids businessman philosophy he used to say to me like we'd say he'd say we're going to get the four to five percent growth and you know we say well\nYou know this is can help grow up but that's that's a really hard thing to do to get the four percent five percent of the things you know how he goes how hard can it be you know I mean he would say it's not going to be that hard you know you just start the dial says outlet for like say\nYou know all the dials under Obama and previously under Bush were kind of turned and the anti growth direction and he came in and just switch the dial stood up\nTo the you know the pro position and by the way my favorite chapter of the book is actually the last one and it's just a short chapter 'cause it's it's it's ... it might not have gotten to a job but the name of the chapter titled a chapter is a light switches flick from off the ... and that came from a guy I met a he was a\nA a runs an auto repair shop you know an outside of Cleveland, Ohio\nIs famous Jimmy and uh you know ... I asked them about a year ago I said Jimmy how's business is that whenever I meet people whether it's a CEO of a major company or a ... local grocery store I or woman you know I say ... ... so he said Steve\nKnow ever since the election of ... you know the day after election in Ninety two thousand sixteen\nSaid a light it was like a light switch was flick from off the island ... ever since then I've had more business than I can possibly handle and I get that kind of story Joe all everywhere I go and it's because people have a new confidence in the economy they're optimistic there's a new\nJob money selling Enron how are you know and that's the thing is it's the tens ability of assets to invest a ... and we don't have to wait for the government to be the venture capitalists of record exactly\nIt shows that there was a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to be invested ... of course we had a recovery under Obama I mean we did have a recovery and it was a long recovery will give Obama credit for that but it was a it was a measly it was a weakling recovery and there is a big difference between a recovery\nAnd boom yeah this is a boom [laughter] this is a full ... did you know Joe there are now ... million\nMore jobs and people to fill them\nI Know that is good this is something to and we need but let me ask you something and this is a we're visiting with Stephen Moore who along with art Laffer written a book called ... and the sort of the story of how\nThis you know guy this quote unquote reality TV show grabs a couple of the most brilliant minds in free market economics and turns it into four percent GDP Growth\nWith Dave Brat was hunky in one of his debates here and of course we were broadcast to the fifth seventh district to Virginia and Dave Brat was in a debate and he was talking about Adam Smith and you know to small companies competing with one another and that's where capitalism you have the greatest generator of of prosperity\nTo do you think there's still more work to be done in that in you know you mentioned the the recovery after the the the housing bubble burst into the bank issues um can we still get\nSmaller and more competitive as these companies can compete with one another or are we going on a track were more Amazon's more Wal Marts\nOr you know I think it's the latter look you know relax not forget ... you know companies like Amazon and Google were small companies at one time and they just grew to these enormously beneficial on and you know\nA great companies whether you're talking about apple whether you're talking about uh you know Microsoft I mean the the whole story of the American economy since you know we began as a nation\nIs you get companies that at one time look indomitable shears remember ...\nBut I mean the the whole story of the American economy since you know we began as a nation is you get companies that at one time look indomitable shears\nRemember a serious wrong with that sort of you know there were everywhere just reached Hitler and like in the country you know and nobody could possibly compete with the earth or remember when a TNT was the biggest company way to break them up on my prediction is like I like\nYou know I Love these big companies like Facebook and Google and apple\nAmazon but I I'm here to tell you ten years from now those won't be the biggest companies and they won't be there'll be some new company that comes along and it knocks them off the perch and that's that's what happens in a in a free market economy and\nThat's why we need more people were the one area where I Want to see more improvement is more small businesses being formed you know people who go out and you know put the shingle in front of the door and open up their uh their shop for business\nAnd uh we need more small businesses because they they're twenty seven million small businessmen and women who run small companies and those people are the backbone of the economy and those were the people we want him to tax cuts for\nIt was it was it wasn't for rich people jobs I mean the left left as his right it was for small businesses so they can grow their business and hire more workers and pay them more ...\nAnd we've seen the ... in the middle class growing number or to the point where now the left media has to say well the middle class has more money but not as much more

middle of North Carolina so it's a tough fight one that we can win but it's definitely a clear contrast you know both\nThe cook Political Report an odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race\nOr in the ... report actually listed this is North Carolina what you can explain the exact areas are that are going to be impacted by by this um this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across the country\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls closed what seven thirty if I remember correctly on election night\nOr they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end\nAh look this is a district that goes from Greensboro down to solve very overcome mores of ill\nAh this is a this is a great a district but it is one of the topics toughest districts in the state is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this a twenty two months ago when I was sworn in that this would be a fight for the foundation for who gets the speaker's gavel\nIn twenty Eighteen and voted it come true now it seems like people are waking up\nVoters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls of the few days of early voting but again this is uh\nWaking up voters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls of the few days of early voting but again this is a con harassed race you know for low unemployment ah like we've got growing the economy did I've done what I said I was going to do\nWell you also have the ninth district in in a tight race\nMark Harris is on on deck and Trump or the president is coming into the port me and mark Harris both uh this coming friday night and so looking forward to mark here is a winning the starting with him he's a great guy I've known him for over two decades or so look forward to him winning and serving right alongside them\nWell this is an important race if you're in the thirteenth congressional district in you're in North Carolina including what much of high point or Greensboro all Davidson ... counties of um parts of Rhone counties and and some others you know this is a big raise this is going to be a bellwether race or election counties\nWell exactly thank you so much\nAll right thank you we wish you the best thing so much for being with US Congressman Ted Budd that's an important or race or let's get to our phones patios in but that is the Maryland Patty how are you\nI'm doing great how are you Sean I'm good thank you glad you called\nYeah you know I'm I just wish I believe in ... I Believe and what he's saying I Believe and what you're saying you cannot let the migrants come in and now it's ridiculous it's out of control but it's all about the whole coordinated effort and showing it so\nThat the Democrats crack can't play their same game as\nYou know the ... you know the way they're using all of their their word you feel sympathy and build\nNext trust against the Republicans and trumpet so good at this she's just got to make sure again there's a coordinated effort said that there is seen that people there and the military show of force start sending buses start sending plane all staged they're ready to say we mean that\nThis is his red in line and the sad just like Obama had with Syria he didn't do that this is ... is is that and he's got to show this and handling is right with a really great question where it needed African\nReally not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela or bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't when you're hiring me the Honduran right president telling the vice president that and Pence told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look bottom line is\nThey should be turned back now but if in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border\nWe're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interests of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border we don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed\nAnd ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis they're going to be on the Mexican side of the border\nBecause America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law\nBut if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying\nWe should have food water medicines supplies and transportation back to where they came from\nAnd I think you can do it in as as expeditious way possible with them as much terrorists possible um but I don't think any arrest ever looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border border one of confrontation\nWith American police and ice and our military\nUm our side is gonna win and you're right we should do it is compassion early as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt\nIn our military um our side is going to win and you're right we should do it as passionately as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt you know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero to lose here\nAnd that's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or you know they're not telling them anything that's on us than truthful that they're telling them they're going to get in\nAnd so they're going to be disappointed feelings of anger anger who's going to probably be on display\nSo we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but you know let's let's be clear here\nThis is the United states of America we're a constitutional republic we believe in the rule of law\nAnd the application of our laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky is in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you\nCalled Becky Hi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on\nWell I got a couple of things being from the border town okay that people don't understand about this this law that's kind of [noise]\nYes they come to our border but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents in all are people that are working with him get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's a long term ramifications of them and I had a feeling of thought about why I'm Mexican Government is not stopping some\nMob it's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members the wire transfers\nSo why should they stop them because they're making money off so I think we should stop the why are trained first\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson the Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been ...

P. document technology partner for Charlottesville central Virginia accident on the road near the twenty nine bypass exit ramp but to be ethical accident in the roadway there and this traffic update on WC age we\nRight welcome back to the large large when Joe pleasure to be with you on a Tuesday evening if you\nIn the roadway there and this traffic update on WC Ajmi\nSense right welcome back to the Lawrence Lawrence and Joe pleasure to be with you on a Tuesday evening if you remember\nThe Obama era you'll remember president who talked about containing ISIS or limiting ISIS or controlling where they could go and sort of geographically a boxing them in a Donald Trump campaign does a president who would wipe out ISIS the destroyed them\nUh and and take them out of power obviously not every person who identified with ISIS has gone to this point\nBut ISIS is I guess more gun than we ever thought it would be under a bronco bomb a rich noises is senior editor for news buskers\nRidge why use the media keeping Donald Trump's defeat of ISIS in Syria Iraq like it's a deep dark secret that they knew ... need not tell the public about\nWell it's one of the one of the bright spots of this presidency I mean you know if you if you look at the evening news you get an unrelenting Lee negative story about this president mostly about the things he tweets the things he says\nA sort of the soap opera aspects of all of this if you look at the record you know the economy\nIs very good job growth is very strong unemployed is that a record low and and foreign policy you have ISIS which was headquartered in Iraq and Syria had taken over key cities virtually extinguished in those areas the economy a Porsche this we did a study earlier in the month\nI think that was less than one tenth of one percent of his coverage over the last four months\nAnd this we looked at it for the whole presidency thirty three minutes of coverage of the president's leadership\nIn the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria out of over ten thousand minutes of evening news coverage that his point three three percent it is a positive story but the media are choosing to focus on other things where they can be negative\nIs there anybody you can sort of called them out on this because rich when I was a you know before he became a talk show host I was a reporter and you always look to to best the competition that is that the competition told a story you at least told the same story and tried to get them one be further down the road in a story\nAnd ... and you always tried to find the story that nobody else was telling\nIsn't there anybody in the fake stream media that's willing to break from the pack\nAnd say you guys aren't telling the story but it's a great story and then contrast it back\nTo some of the comments of bomb I still remember when he sat down for an interview with somebody from ABC News and he was explaining very carefully why it was so hard to hit ISIS where they lived in rock or\nBecause it was tough to to get to the target and you know as you explained all the difficulties and about three days later the French for goodness sake went in and bomb the daylights out of Raqqa and remember running the soundbite able bomber explaining how hard it was to get to them and say\nYou know when the French military God Bless them can out do the United states or what the United States president things is capable it really doesn't say good things about your about your capabilities does it\nRight that's exactly right and I would say one of the it's got extremely little grudging coverage but one of the big differences is President Trump chose a policy early on where he de centralized the authority to their commanders in the field\nYou decide what to bomb we're not going to strangle it up and washing the way it was during the Obama administration\nAnd that has helped the or the generals in the field get the success that they have that was\nYou know there was there's been a couple of stories at the very end of twenty Seventeen a listing this is one of the bright spots Hans Nichols did a story for NBC\nBut it it really has been you know pushed out of the headlines\nHe's Seventeen a listing this is one of the bright spots Hans Nichols did a story for NBC but it it really has been you know pushed out of the headlines you know the war is I mean that the Trump part of it is about thirty three minutes the entire\nA war against Iraq against ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing the whole state of it a hundred and fifty seven minutes of evening news coverage in almost two years this is a this is a very very small percentage of the news coverage they're acting as this thing\nIs a big story you you were talking about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen this was seen as a major problem for the Obama administration now that it's not a problem\nUh thanks to impart President Trump and his leadership and his administration they don't want to talk about it I think you know if if they're going to be unfair to the guy and badger him over things they should at least be fair at sometimes and and covered the things that are going up pretty well the the record is better than people generally know that it is\nWell and I guess let me make this comparison\nWhen Katrina happen and it was seen as a as a big you know food bar for the Bush administration uh and and the media seem to love to go back and do follow up stories and say well I remember when Katrina was handled so badly will here's how they're doing now\nI understand that most news is about things that do happen and then it's harder to cover the house the didn't burn down or the bad thing that didn't happen so they could say well now that ISIS isn't doing as much we're not covering things they're not doing but to some extent what they're not doing is the story\nBut if you wanted to do a story you could go to those regions\nAnd said this was a region that used to be dominated by ISIS with all the bad effects that would have on the local populations and everything else\nAnd this is what's going on there now because the Trump Administration has pulled off what Brock Obama had declared to be impossible just a couple of years before and that story is completely doable\nAnd it's actually a very good story and the and the media does love to do sort of the good news stories you know you set up a new program to make this happen and look it's happening and you do the happy story that that whatever it was you intended a program and then you have the alternative\nPrograms that were set up to do some good and they didn't do any good but they spend a lot of money and you do that story as well they could do any of those stories right now\nBut I think they're making editorial choices not to because they don't want to make Trump look good\nI think you're right I think I mean CBS has done is put a little more resources into this and the other two than NBC or ABC and I believe they had their correspondence walking in the city of Raqqa in Syria which was the headquarters of ISIS\nUh they can go there now and walk around and talk to the people who live there and his regime I mean that is a very compelling story we got a little little sliver of it uh but you know given the importance of was to to the United states you think we'll be hearing a lot more about it not a lot less\nI Would think so too are there other good examples you've run into where the mainstream media is avoiding telling me good store I just heard today that we're looking to maybe finish out the fourth quarter of this you're economically at four percent GDP and yet I have yet to see a mainstream news organization New York times the Washington Post\nThe New York times and it pays the salary of Paul Krugman who had declared that anything passed a two percent growth rate simply was not possible and now we may finish out this year with the for the fourth quarter and the four percent range\nAnd I would think good any reporter worth his or her sold would say this was declared impossible a couple of years ago and now it's now it's happening but again that would require the old grey lady the New York times\nOld would say this was declared impossible a couple of years ago and now it's now it's happening but again that would require the old grey lady the New York times to actually say Trump is pulled off the impossible which I think they're getting tired of writing these days\nYeah there's been incredibly little coverage of that as well I mean looking at you know the tax cuts in particular are given a\nLot of coverage and negative court when they were being debated well right if they took effect you saw those companies giving a big bonuses to people you saw you've seen companies with higher growth that led to or not dot today or other or in the last couple of days but big gains on Wall street\nUh and it's led to that economic boom so has the deregulation campaign those have gotten just a a few minutes of coverage in this vast sea of of negative news this year uh it's what's what are the unsung success stories that I think needs to be told\nHey rich last thirty seconds what's gonna happen when this caravan reaches the border which I think they'll do before election day how are they going to ... how are they going to cast this one depending on what happens when those those are you know illegal aliens is what they are getting to the border\nWell they're already you know you've got I think every network now has people embedded in this caravan paint painting it is extremely sympathetically\nBut they won't answer the question of what gives them the right to come in a uh to the United states where they you know didn't file paperwork or anything like that\nBut when you talk about freezing bank account who's bank account would you like to freeze and what would be your legal or what's the legal reason because you know you got a bank account I've got a bank account the government can't come in and freeze your bank account without some legal authority\nAnd I know a lot of us suspect that there is money that is flowing to this group\nThrough a bunch of cut outs that are probably so thorough I told one of my producers he said well how could that happen I said well let's say George Soros who a lot of us suspect\nSo he's got the tides foundation a private nonprofit foundation\nHe'd tell somebody at the ... foundation has already sent money to say some do good or groups in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Mexico and what what do they do with it day by soccer balls for kids and they buy meals for poor people whatever they do with that they've got money that's already in Mexico\nAnd so one of those groups is gets the word go and take some of the money out and help fund this caravan\nHow do you stop that most of it is likely happening not inside our borders and not in banks that we have anything to do it so how it's easy to say shut them down freeze the account\nBut what mechanism do you use to tell a private nonprofit non governmental organization an NGO in Mexico that has money to help the poor\nThat they can't take money out of their bank account and go down in by meals for some of the seven thousand\nThat are affiliated there isn't any other on\nYour head or to Ford would reasonably say what the heck does our plant making wiring harnesses for Ford escapes have to do or whatever it is they're making down there what does that have to do this ...\nIt it is no\nNo no no no because what you're talking about his year lashing\nOut and saying well let's just hurt some American companies and say you could stop the how was Ford Motor company supposed to stop the caravan\nThough that's got to be able to collect the money that they're going to lose business they're going to lose it\nYou're just going to you're going to point of financial gun at anybody's had who's within sight were connected to America and you're going to say make this happen or else well the Mexican government can say Ford\nMotor Company can't tell us what to do the Mexican authorities have the power to do something about this caravan they could simply say we're not going to allow this big group of people\nTo do this but I don't see\nHow you start then lashing out at every American Company saying you're down there so therefore you're part of the problem\nBut we are that's all it could last for days four days or so finally woke up and they realize that we're serious the shutdown last three or four or five days\nI felt that I think the president's threat to Mexico is serious and I think he'll probably ... through Twitter or through ... public announcements before then\nBut when you just say start attacking American companies do back in business and Mexico it'd be like telling companies that do business in some other foreign company like Germany Germany does something we don't like do you\nWatch all of us are shooting at all I Know I Know\nI Know I'll tell you what do you\nI mean like Germany Germany does something we don't like\nTo watch all of us are shooting at all I Know I Know\nI Know I'll tell you what the US government and the military is very good at guarding borders we guard borders as we pointed out last night in Afghanistan we've guarded borders in Iraq\nWe've ... and I think that the United states military is very good at guarding borders they're very good at concertina wire and as far as I'm concerned put a bunch of that on the border and beef up customs and border protection the border patrol\nAnd say to them look nobody's coming across this line and to to some extent we're in a good spot now because if they try to come across in one big massive group\nThere'll be a lot easier to deal with what I Wonder is as they get close to the border\nAre they going to start to spread out I mean if there's one big giant caravan you can probably stop that from coming across the border but if they split up and they started heading for fifty different spots on the U.S border the parts that don't have wall\nAnd don't have a lot of patrols it's going to be very difficult to do that a lot of her I'm not disagreeing that we need to do something I'm just suggesting that those things like ... attacking American companies that do business in Mexico who can reasonably say we have nothing to do with this let's go to Stan Stan welcome to Lars Larson show\nHey Laurie thanks for having me but uh [noise] so I think both of you guys

S. and I think what we're seeing is that our dog is trying to put pressure on the U.S administration to distance himself from everywhere from the foggy leadership on this particular issue\nChoked you ... did Saudi Arabia have anything to gain by murdering ... ...\nI mean you tend to also of course it sounds like a movie live in a democracy here in the west they make such a such an actually it's solving sang had all the magic unable or either I don't know why the Saudis would even take the flu\nBut it looks like a this particular journalist was highly critical of the Saudi monarchy and looking into his prize in Turkey over the last few years it seems like he was getting closer to the Turkish leadership that's also I'm supporting I don't want to take\nAnd I don't want to give us too much credit but he was effectively endorsing and supporting\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and ... and the eight ball fast who was all the problems they they do have more democratically governs in Middle East just a little bit but also a very problematic looks because we also understand it the Democratic pretensions\nIdeas on that but it's nice among monarchy voters says popularly elected Islamist government's view crucial he was on that turkey side of the fight I mean of course doesn't warrant the Saudis taking any kind of action like this especially from a freedom for journalists\nA free press a point of view but it looks like he wants to eliminate the especially crown prince and the effort to eliminate this\nUh important force that he saw in the journal is he was up to remind our audience a columnist for the Washington Post\nWhich is a pretty influential if you think about it and I think they want it to me this and move on the way and yes has done really against internal enemies are inside Saudi Arabia as well\nSo I think this is the line with his actions and then at the end the crown prince of leadership style or the um do you have to give him credit\nDoes that mean that they would have done this thinking we can do this without anyone finding out because we had to know that there would be some blowback if they murdered journalist who was tied to the Washington Post the United states would be called upon to respond as I understand turkey lots of journalists all the time\nAnd and I would imagine that they're probably people locked up in Saudi Arabia for over ...\nIt's fun I as I understand in Turkey lots of journalists all the time uh and and I would imagine that there are probably people locked up in Saudi Arabia for a for going past the rules in that country as well and yet those don't cause international incidents but most of them don't involve people or or green card residents of the United states\nYes exactly and um and even you also know that the journalists had a good connections with us a\nA central institutions beyond that just the Washington Post I think it's fair to say that he he exiting more than a journalist perhaps it was even an activist I was looking out for U.S interests and I think that helps\nA you know a hype the problem but also turkey has a lot of these here and the fact that it has this leverage either on has a place his hands quite to out here and the house by by hiking up this issue so in the last\nFew weeks turkey has been steadily leaking information day by day and thereby ensuring that this issue keeps dominate the wellhead wind globally\nAnd ... one of the things I understand the paper that had originally claimed in Turkey that they had the audio recording of ... death now says well maybe we don't have the recording\nSo some of the information that was pushed out early to try to get a lot of attention to this that you had this murder happened inside the Saudi embassy that there was audio tape of it\nThat you know it sounded horrific and then we find out the certain bits and pieces that were pushed out early to get everybody amped up above the story don't exist\nYeah man or a\n... yeah well the problem is nobody has really hurt this takes pride and that's what President Trump has been saying as well that she wants to see the evidence but the Turks are claiming they have\nThat particular newspaper that you mention really glad you did mention that he could even today much owned by the Turkish government that effectively adults propaganda machine and I don't even go far as to say that that newspapers are as the largest\nSources of information we in Turkey um\nAnd it only carry the messages that are pushed by the Turkish government so it's a highly problematic at\nThe only source of information that we have on the monitor and the higher ordeal surrounding it is just come out from the Turkish side I wouldn't look at\nThe newspapers or even a some forces coming from the Turkish government as credible it's very important that as the United nations that have called for that we need to have some more transparency so I Would like to see other sources cooperating with the Turks are wondering 'cause we can't really trust that ...\nTo ... I got thirty seconds what's the right thing for the United states to do because one of our best asset to in that region is Saudi and there aren't any good replacement what should the United states do at this point\nIn your life is hobbies are important right now for the U.S especially with the sanctions that are about to come again on Iran I think the U.S does need cooperation with Saudi Arabia\nWe heard secretary of state Mike Pompeo today say that as some Saudi officials who might have been as possible for the harder it is a ... it could be a denied he ... he and I said\nCapable and I've seen some interviews with these people saying oh yeah we're workers will come and work hard well that's not the point if you're trying to escape persecution that would justify refugee or asylum status that's not just people saying I'd like a better job in a better rate of pay that's not going to justify status on the border isn't\nThat's exactly right so this is this comes back to the issue of the core issue here and that is right now we've got a problem in our asylum\nProcess are sound system and we've got loopholes in our laws as you point out especially with children that's making it difficult for us to enforce our laws um right now you've seen a spike in families at the border since the end of the zero tolerance policy I think it's been like Seventy five percent increase that's like a couple of months\nYou up and so now everyone knows\nIf you want to get into the United states bring a child as you point out doesn't even have to be your child just grandchild through and as long as you can hold that Keith together\nFor a little while he does get together for a little while you get three right now and on our and our immigration courts are burst thinks the themes and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough\nUm that's something that Congress needs to change\nFirst states to seems and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough and that's something that Congress needs to change\nWell is there a way to stop this group before they hit American soil because I Know that a lot of people don't appreciate does but if you get your feet on American soil then you're entitled to full constitutional rights if you're stopped short of the border then you don't have any constitutional rights whatsoever\nSo but is there a way to do that the president has threatened to use the military to stop this but it does the military set up two feet south of the Mexican border or three feet north of the Mexican border\nYeah see and that's the problem I think the reality is that if you try to use the military first of all there's limitations on what you can even use the military for we have certain laws that prohibit the military from engaging in certain law enforcement access because you don't want the military Kelly used being used for law enforcement\nRegarding a border he is the job of the United states military isn't it\nI I agree the problem is is that when you get asylum law to the issue if these people are supposedly coming across to claim asylum then that's a law that's being broken and so that's a law enforcement issue and that's really where the rub comes in it and even if you get put\nThat the military at the border you Dan would have to say okay uh what you'd have to ... it would have to cover every stretch of the\nOf the of the border and if they got as you point out uh one foot across the border\nAnd what do you do they claim asylum and all of a sudden the military has to bring an ice anyone I think\nIf people are going to come to a thousand or ... how many thousands of miles it is to get here they're just gonna keep on trying until they get a cry\nNow David I Know this is all of a situation where neither one of us has full details but\nThe president early on said to Guatemala and Honduras stop this group or you're going to lose your foreign aid which is something that is within his control I Believe you know the Congress can allocate the money and they have appropriate the money for foreign foreign aid but the president controls how's that dispersed\nOr the president is also said to Mexico you stop this group which they don't appear to be doing right now and if you don't stop them you may just lose that us MCA trade deal and it's and and I ... and it appeared I I thought at the beginning when the president made that threat by tweet\nOr that Mexico was going to take that seriously\nIs that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits but we will stop them in our country or is it to Mexico's benefit to a ... some it snows at at President Trump and say we're going to let them keep on going you figure out what to do with them on that once they get north or your border\nYeah I mean I think this this has further complicated by the fact that right now you are looking at a incoming New Mexico ... so even if we had a perfect partner in Mexico they were going to be exactly what we wanted them to do\nThat's not necessarily the case in you know a couple of months the new incoming next to Kevin ... has indicated you know less willingness to cooperate with the United states at seven now David out that was that was the campaign so we don't know but still that's not a good sign\nI very much appreciate
