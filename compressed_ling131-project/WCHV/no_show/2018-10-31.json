college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home correct in addition\nTo the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund of three to six months of expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that\nAbout the\nGood okay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that\nSix is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can show what I Would do with this money is I Would ever market for school and mission trip\nBecause you guys are obviously LDS right\nWe are yeah OK cool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college\nTake the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund and your name\n\nWith us in Springfield, Missouri river salary you may not talk to you too what's up [noise]\nUm my husband and I\nWe just finished ... you were on baby steps to and\nFor the last five years we have been building our home paycheck to paycheck and um\nIt's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it a kind of get things rolling a little bit but um\nWe got an offer to give the care taking position\nAnd the guy a thought a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home\nIn the same town we live\nUm do we tell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed well we're at a point it means a paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home\nUm but then we got that offered to live and how basically for free and he pays a dilemma here and take care of\nI got that are okay so that's so you've never lived in this other house no okay\nIt's gonna be a little tough to sell it and the condition that San ...\nLike they can't get financing on it\nRight and so you're going to take a whipping a what will it take money wise to finish it\nRight and so you're going to take a whipping a what will it take money wise to finish it\n\nWell I never had a professional answer on that but probably about\nEight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income\nWell my husband he worked forty hours a week ...\nWhat's your household income\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working\nWell we have a business\nUm that doesn't make it out and running\nIt doesn't make money\n[noise] his income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nGetting the care taking condition or there'll be making about forty eight hundred\nCash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part in till you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore\nThat science so I mean he could walk into more on fire you pretty much I changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand it's not completed\nSo probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because you you it's a further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers out\nBecause they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling tool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise]\nHow much will be borrowed against it so far\n[noise] the house itself we owe thirty thousand but there are some property attached to it so altogether it a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property\nYeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property as well yes okay All right yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so\nAs soon as possible\nContinue signing money until we yeah\nWe all have you know I should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're gonna get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm\nVery very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term\nMeet very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's turn around and get it sold as fast as possible\nNow if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first celebrate so an acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved\nOlivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nCouldn't hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I just had a question and I had a Mexican amount of debt and I'm I'm wanting to pay that off the air that ray [noise] I'm about an hour so in our coverage for an end to the action and an idea that it's going to therapy so [noise]\nAnd I hear your regular income ... budget and pet therapy at the end it likely not going to get paid and how kind of had to quit that have not really sure way to put it in the budget [noise] or how big of a priority to make it\nHow long you been clean and have any kind of\nGood for you well then what is it\n[noise] um actually addiction ...\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now there's just something you need you need some accounts or walk with you as you finish this life transformation in that that is essential to you having a life\nWould you agree with that statement yeah now what I Would do\nIs is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not going to still be going to their therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise therapist is not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen\nIs is that as you continue to address your income injure outgo you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing you're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year\nWe ought to be making more money right\nLet's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the debt mess to but for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start by but it's not like you told me you've been you know clean for two years\nThe time you calling for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you\nYeah [laughter] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money\nOkay and as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK Now getting the money no it's not all or nothing it's going to be gradual it'll be incremental you'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or years four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now\nAnd you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and cut more and you know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right mhm yeah [laughter] okay\nWell I Want you to finish turning the corner you've turned the corner with you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then as you\n[laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turn the corner and let's let's gone out and then as you make incremental progress\nMore and more than money from the new incoming your increased income to\nThe death shot but for today we want to take care of a movie [noise] you need to be taken care of\nYour daughters are dropping your show\nThis or whatever I'm sure [noise]\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money ... how often or you're stressed about bills and afraid\nUm and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a recovery is opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise] and uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on our will and so because we had the special needs is a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation\nWe uh you know I'm a we've been discussing a special needs trust on world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal\nShore ah originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps\nFive um the uh and that we would\nYou know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course\nAh you know his his teachers are boring sport too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's [laughter] he's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um\nAnd we don't have to uh [noise] uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations but uh\nBut now as we're as I'm getting into it and we haven't found anything quite yet but it would come down to the wire one of the things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust

fourteenth amendment said anyone who's subject to the jurisdiction and that's the wiggle room and it is they tried to to\nTo the slice bologna simply as to what jurisdiction means but the ... the pope

health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do it to the deficit and debt and rationing health care and it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that\nAnd then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of the playbook that the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse you know look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but now they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nStrong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable lungs up\nWell it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to it\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one from my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look what we have done with this economy\nOn the national international stage as well or with the president and when it comes to sitting down with North Korea heading for nuclear is

vote for Nancy Pelosi and boats\n... in any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs his vote for below sea because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi boat with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ...\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings a look at the\nThe agenda Democrats is it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to limit their eyes open borders\nThey want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or death city considering they ... how many there are countless I read in Iowa that I've seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors in plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high\nCan even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right\nMy opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care\nAnd of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you know this and are blisters and all this impeachment\nMhm now that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department and intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those

you do you bet\nWelcome a ball the best to you and six days ah it's tough out there nobody can predict what certain say but I Will tell you they don't I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me\nAnd I never you never really have a feel for how the house is going to go twenty ten might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power for forty years Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nAnd also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against their forty five retirements and\nA headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first midterm but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving\nOf Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and serious reforms in Washington and I think the same thing\nYou know you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty to an app specially after Obamacare\nIt's reforms in Washington and I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb on me and it was just a white powder and twenty to an app specially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats would that that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to hear this a brass means to poll out today I had to go back and double check it showing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval rating stays at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nAnd I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not\nBefore and and all the media likes to go after asked me to ... I don't know why he's a great guy in a smart poster but you know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that raspy used in was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact\nOn the midterm elections but again it's all up to now the interesting developments as a relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico and up\nNow you have and I look there's always the most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey\nHope an opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are a sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life\nAnd that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen the president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants\nAnd from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage it'd be clear point two percent\nOr you know last source our quarter reporting that she identified him as Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away um but\nActually the Mexican ambassador to the U.

Dr ...\nThank you for having me\nDidn't push the right button that that happens from time to time that you wrote what I thought was an absolutely brilliant piece that I Want people to read it American greatness about what you see as some of the internal contradictions of the caravan of\nWhatever has now fourteen thousand a hundred thousand or seven thousand people that are aiming to march all the way to the American border where do you see those contradictions\nWell I mean\nDon't you think that the entire open borders movement is sort of predicated on a grievance against the United states is in a phobic or racist or national as ... and yet people want to come in here so the obvious\nConclusion is so bad why wouldn't you just stop when you get across the border of Mexico and enjoy as similar cultures similar language seminal were\nEnvironment and you wouldn't have to go into this area that people and they open borders little and has a shortage says so hospitable immigrants and ... that's one of them\nAnd Mexico as offered said you can stay here if you want to have an ... doesn't that actually change their refugees that if he's if you say I'm fleeing persecution you get to a friendly country in Mexico says day if you want to will will help you if you know get set up here and you say I'm no I'm not interested you're no longer a refugee are you\nOne would think so but also one of the\nPretext of why people are living in Las Vegas and loses the lady as we cause it to\nThe lawlessness of some for America where the country's excluding Costa Rica has created such a form of violence they have to leave but then the answer to that\nLawlessness is too low asleep cross the Mexican border and then ... enter the United states\nAnd then laws they continue to resolve again\nAnd that almost begs the question I mean\nOur east Central American countries lawless because of the collective values of the population and some some cases and that is if people don't see that contradiction that they're breaking the law because they're angry about others breaking the law then why would they come to the United states and not assume they can continue\nTo break the law which causes reasons for them to leave in the first place\nYou know Dr I literally play the sound by last night that the drift Jenkins of Fox News God he was interviewing just some random caravan go or through a translator and he asked the man why he was coming to America and he said well\nI'm coming to America to ask for a pardon for the class three felony that he had been found guilty of in America attempted murder and uh I think Jenkins is a little taken aback this guy was just talking like yeah I got an attempted murder and I think I'll go to America and see if they'll cleared up for me a\n... not a not an accusation but a conviction and and these are some of the people that are coming north and the care of in\nThe eye\nUh the ... not ... not an accusation but a conviction and and these are some other people that are coming north and the care of it\nYeah I I think is also a contradiction here in the United states that a lot of the advocates\nOf open borders are welcoming the caravan do so in the abstract but the concrete manifestations of their advocacy will fall on Hispanic communities what their schools will be impacted\nOr crime or increase for African Americans will have to compete with entry level jobs are just rural people where I live where we've had a lot of gang incidents by people improperly admitted on Central America into California and I can attest pushed and that\nIt's sometimes like ... and the ... used to be quite safe but the people that you'd get\nWant this to happen the polo sea so that Dianne Feinstein which for show or a or the joy of Mark Zuckerberg's they don't seem to have a capital you there to select neighborhoods are walls around there are states or private schools for their children that they are always immune\nFrom the ramifications of variety allergy I think that's what gets people angry because they feel that it's an elite enterprise at sort of a pure metal alliance between a very poor abroad and the very wealthy at home without consideration how that affects the middle class is growing the United states\nI'm Talking to Dr Victor Davis Hanson who's a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author most recently the brand new book coming out to in March of next year the case for Trump and of course the there is one of his parents' books max of ... state of becoming so among the other contradictions of the caravan\nIs it you know I mentioned this moment to go there they're not truly refugees too in that case why why are reporters and worm American citizens seeming will seemingly willing to buy the story that they're refugees when most of them in the interviews I've seen them say I want to come to America because the jobs pay better there\nYeah I think part partly people are naive and they always want to be under privileged on that may lead to some of that one of the the more likely I mean this was more or less time\nOn to 'em criteria one was that when that happened in July was a media spectacle of children separated from their parents and the it resulted in immediate drop and Trump's approval ratings for about four or five points and the surgeon fundraising the Democratic party's you don't mean\nPrimaries and ... and so I think people thought\nPeople being sympathetic people bought it and make perhaps here as well thought if we time another caravan and lives in or near midterms then we'll have the same crisis effect Trump will probably react in a way that does not\nAppear therapeutic are sympathetic and made me right before the midterm Lincoln across that approval rating is six or seven points five points\nAnd down ballot battle held back because I think it's kind of our long and her\nChildren on it but the caravan come and saw him on find and then that knows right on the eve of the metro\nAre these people coming north and are those people who've entered recently are they likely to assimilate into America the way other generations have seen people from Europe and and uh from even Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe\nAssimilate into our culture and become part of what is the American culture all Americans but but with characteristics that we bring from all kinds of different background\nAnd no I mean I live in an area that second third generation Mexican Americans who came legally and measured numbers\nYes and no I mean I live in an area that second third generation Mexican Americans who came legally and measured numbers are and the ... and they came with people as you mentioned all these other countries are completely assimilated in America and the great\nBut the impediment so that ... caught processor usually with it come from this area in math without legalities without ... without skills rotate them and they outreach education from people\nCome in young males Latin America it's not a high school diploma without a high school on average\nSo that means people are going to comment on clay speak Spanish I have not have the skills immediately to compete be dependent on\nA public entitlements will give them just enough to get by but create sort of a ... when they see the vast wealth around them and they're forced to work and then the level of jobs without access because they don't they're not educate them not legal to upward mobility so we know\nWhat works and what a ... unfortunately we noticed it on the left field that when people come illegally and math and without easily assemble assimilation scale\nThey tend to vote and block the people who call us with some entitlement that's been true since the nineteenth century and I think that's part of what's driving and you look at California it's split them up to open a blue state barbecue because of Latino immigration so has\nThe government says you're not an American citizen so he sued saying well yes I Am I was born in the United states is subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and the court in that case says no you're not a citizen when you were born at the time you were born you were born subject uh in large part\nTo the jurisdiction an own sovereignty to your tribe so you were not\nIn that in the moment you were born you are not subject completely to the jurisdiction of the United states and you are not a citizen and so that was something that as you noted since it wasn't on the fourteenth amendment Congress or years later passed a law granting citizenship\nTo Native Americans or should they accepted that she should they should their tribes be okay with that and so that was not something another fourteenth amendment and in fact something that the courts and and everybody involved the greed\nOr even though they were born in the United states the geographic United States they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states under the fourteenth amendment\nNow Amy I'm Talking to Amy swear whose legal policy analyst in heritage here's the throne of your issue except I think this one's got a simple answer too but I'm a non lawyer so you know I don't worry about billable hours I don't have to make things complicated\nAh the president says I can for those who are the executive order and I of all these losers who's very large you didn't like what Obama did and I said no I didn't like it when Obama\nSaid I Want to train federal immigration laws says you have to cook the DACA kids out because that's what the law said and he tries to fix a law my son and a piece of paper is though that is ... you can change the law by funding piece of paper you can't\nPresident Trump does not proposed to dreams the constitution or amended who does not proposed the dream federal law he merely says\nAll the way along the federal bureaucracy has recognized or has said in effect the the the fourteenth amendment says if you're born here no matter what your circumstances you're an American citizen we're now going to change that interpretation can he do that with an executive order\n[noise] well so what let me start off by saying that it's incredibly hard to speculate because we don't have\nAn executive order in front of us don't have the language of what he purports to do with it but that being said this is very very different from a for instance what you saw under DACA where\nThat Congress passed a law there are laws regarding the deportation of people who are in the United states illegally and the Obama administration essentially said we don't like that we're going to prioritize so that certain individuals are not deported and also on top of that even though Congress gave us no authority to do this we're going to uh make it so that\nCertain individuals have legal status or outside of what Congress has stated that that's a lot different from a president saying look\nThere is no clear authority especially not from the Supreme Court not from Congress as to what the\nFourteenth amendment means with regard to the children of illegal aliens and so it would be well within his his\nConstitutional authority to save\nA instruct executive agencies who issued passports and Social Security numbers that they're going\nThere's no authority to save a instruct executive\nAgencies who issue passports and Social Security numbers that they're going to to execute the laws in a manner that is\nConsistent with this very limited view of of who is and who is not a citizen that given that Congress hasn't really said one way or the other and at the Supreme Court certainly has not ruled on that but\nEspecially not in the last hundred and Twenty years ago so it's two very different situations there um but again hard to speculate we don't actually know what this executive order might say\nBut at least we finally get tested that she will I mean I'm sure it'll be fairly quickly challenged by someone although do they have to wait until somebody is through harmed in the eyes of the law by the implementation of this before they're going to actually ...\nAh yeah it might make guesses\nYou would see just like what the travel ban almost immediately\nDozens if not hundreds of lawsuits being filed asking for an injunction almost certainly one would be granted by some judge somewhere with a nationwide injunction uh and and it would ultimately given the gravity of of the question at the serious nature of it it hits at the core of of the constitution\n... there's no way that would avoid the Supreme Court\nOther than they dismiss it on some sort of jurisdiction all thing um but but ultimately it\nIt's a question of Supreme Court hasn't touched for about a hundred and Twenty years uh and\nShowed an executive order issued there there is a good chance at that if the executive order does anything meaningful it's going to make its way to the Supreme\nCourt will use Ernie down your mind that the five originalist will vote to say we're going to go with the original meaning of the fourteenth amendment or do you think there's a question there about how the ... vote\nI think there's there's always a question when you're dealing with medical especially when you don't have the order in front of you um you know and and it it's always hard to speculate what I can say is that it has heritage is position and that is the position of of many\nOriginalist scholars that it is very clear based on the jurisdiction all history or sorry on on the um the legislative\nHistory that the original intention what Congress intended to do with it what do you give citizenship only two children who were born in the United states were subject to a complete

much money for a laptop just as always stuck in my craw and I thought well one day they'll probably make a laptop it's the same cost as everybody else but apparently their business model doesn't support that so what do they come out with that was new\nWell a lot of native ice and he'll be insisted that they have a new I've had the I'd had pro is a factor it's actually a better processor loops ... the ... is a product that many people thought had been completely forgotten and got a repressed as well\nIt starts at eight hundred dollars to I've had pro is talking about massive toll point nine innings display of vaccine lighter than the previous versions starts at a thousand bucks\nOf course you know you can snap the pencils or the side of your I had pro not a big deal there but ... also got a refreshed so not majoring is not new products a refresher on ah some old familiar classics\nSo they've improved all the products but nothing really that jumped right out they said there's the new retina display chair seen the retina display on some of their products and it's a very pretty screen them if you're looking at photos and things like that it's it's great if you're watching a movie it's great but but nothing really dramatically new right\nNow this was not a major product announcement a lot of times ... the sort of off cycle announcements right before the holidays to announce new things we didn't see anything that we hadn't seen before a lot of updates on existing products you mentioned the high rise retina display and that's been out for ... years and then I approached with about time that the air Sadat display\nAll right let's talk about Congress I mean Congress we talked about almost every day but are they going to do something\nAbout Google and Facebook when it comes to data privacy and uses their job to safeguard the data or to force a private company to safeguard the data of its customers or is that the job of the company and the job of the consumer to be uh\nDave Guard the data or to force a private company to safeguard the data of its customers or is that the job of the company and the job of the consumer to be a you know consumers aware that there is a threat out\nThere yeah yeah and certainly I think that it has to start with the consumer the consumer how to me ultimately responsible for knowing where their data is going\nAnd if you promise the Internet at all in the last couple of months you notice the results of the genie PR the general data protection regulation that's from the new but it affects websites everywhere you've seen that do you accept these cookies notices\nThat is a direct response to the European Union union laws and the question is will our Congress enact similar laws\nEnsuring that companies often end users\nTo collect information about them and their data privacy now I I Would argue that most listeners and really even probably you and I\nDon't fully understand what that warning message means we click it to get to the content we're looking at we assume that every website is going to be tracking our behavior and tracking some information about us the question is how much\nHow honest and open and transparent are they about that and it gives us give us as the new regulations require\nThe ability to take our information out of there and say I no longer trust you I no longer wanting attracting my data cleans delete it and do the company's then follow suit it's a bit of a complicated issue and its convention as saying what if anything Congress can agree on\nTo propose to the American people that say hey this is how we're going to protect your data but I think even before any of that happens bars it's important that we take an active role in protecting our own private do you\nSuppose that any of these ... companies like Google and Facebook might say to you we understand that some of you have particular data concerns I worry about that a bit Brian because of the new year of what I Do for a living and some of the crazy people that of occasionally come after me or my family\nUm but frankly that's been at the ebb tide for a while so I'm I'm Glad for that but there were times where it was truly frightening so would they ever on for somebody like me well you're going to have access to all those but you may pay a little bit more but will agree not to grab your date at all because you think that is that a you know\nA private company would say let's do things that meet the needs of our consumers some of them don't care if you're gather data other people care intensely why not why not have the private company meet that need by saying yeah you can have access but if we're not getting your data we need to pay for some other way\nGetting our data I mean it's important to point out that the reason these companies want your data is because that's where the money is Facebook can target more effective ads to you if they know a little bit of pouch or in some cases a lot about you and so you're saying large you know hey I Want to pay ten bucks a month for Facebook to\nHave a privacy or a free version of attracting free person if you will so that you get all the content of Facebook but to contribute to pitch in to the kitty for example you're willing to pay a monthly subscription and I think as\nThese rules and regulations get rolled out and people have a more in depth conversation about privacy some business are gonna have to take a look at that now\nThe Facebook so that kind of Google's of the world could probably afford to have a few million users to opt out of tracking with no big deal but if you're a small start up and that's how you're making your money based on the data and targeting advertisement\nYou may be looking for another option and frankly I Would welcome that if it's a service like Facebook that I use and and they can provide a level of service maybe a phone number I can call when there's a problem I'd probably be happy to pay nine ten bucks a month for something like that if the value proposition was there and I knew my data was here\nBy the way we had a tremendous little success peace with phase I mean we've had our troubles batteries for over the years but but wait to hear this land to do a broadcast from a University of publicly supported the college Republicans said come down Lars and you'll speak to our group\nYeah that land to do a broadcast from a University of publicly supporting the college Republicans said\nCome down Lars and you'll speak to our group and you do your broadcast from here and we will up we were celebrating the second amendment week\nI said I'd be happy to do it well the last minute the college shut it down because as you know I carry a gun everyday although for me to do that is completely legal it's within the law and the university has no power to stop me will the university than threatened the students\nThe ... they said we'll take away your funding for your college Republican club a will will ah sanction you use students maybe drawing you know pulled up in front of a disciplinary committee and hearing all these things\nAnd in the past I never would have been able to do much to respond because like it or not when you do a broadcast you have to have permission to be on somebody's you know to use a room or whatever\nAnd and I plan to have you know as many kids wanted to stop buying and talk during breaks and that sort of thing well that didn't happen because the university denied this phase could denied the access to the Internet connections so I said to my producer let's go up and we'll do Facebook Live stream from the campus and we did exactly that and you know that\nThing has had so many hits it's somewhere in the I think it's four hundred thousand plus on that piece of video where I just stood there and the ... and ... on the campus in the student union and explain what had been done how the students were threatened how they were told you cannot invite this person to campus\nThen how they were literally threatened with disciplined as ... as individuals students it you can't do that to a young man or woman who's Nineteen or twenty say you may end your college career right here now because you invited somebody we don't like\nTo come to the campus and it got a tremendous response from around the whole country\nWell and and let's talk about Facebook Live and some of these other tools and you know we're talking about privacy and how we can pay for the how these companies can pay for these products everyone from you know think about Google mail and all of the products that they released largely for free well they're not for him because they're using your data to be able to sell advertising and\nThat Facebook Live broadcast was only possible because you opted into allowing some of your data shared advertisements to be targeting you\nAnd the four hundred thousand people that have that that video so yup on our on our Facebook is where the audiences and for broadcasters like yourself and myself\nAre that's where we need to me and it's great that they find a way to pay for those even if that is with our privacy but he comes back to that we have to be concerned about our own privacy and there's no sense and waiting for Congress to decide what if anything they're gonna do take an active role take it to that\nYep absolutely Brian thank you so much for the time\nYou got a happy Halloween That's Brian ... you know happy Halloween to you as well that is Brian Westbrook you find what he writes had Brian Westbrook Dodd come on and tell you about ... you know it's not smart job sites that overwhelmingly with lots of resumes you know what his march zipper critter dot com slash Lars unlike the other job sites\nOver the past ten years that's a lot\nNow there's a lot of people who are Christians but there are that's gone down quite a bit\nOkay so the the number leaving has we now have eight percent who dropped out of Christianity\nIt was something like on the order of Seventy eight percent per claiming themselves to be Christians and now as down around Seventy\nWhat is whereas we\nHave now you know the nuns ... the so called nuns which have atheists agnostic atheist which is are probably in there and mostly a son that's like twenty seven percent\nYou're a philosopher what what causes people to turn from conventional route religions to religion's really have to be described as on the fringe\nWell if if a religion is not going to say it is true and their religion is only going to say it as one of many and that you have options\nPeople are going to say you know what maybe this religion isn't true maybe this religion is just one of many options and they're going to naturally go to some place that does say hey this is true these weapons are saying this is true and that Christianity is false and people are hungry\nFor this kind of certitude that ah that we're not providing them frankly\nMaybe they're right in in saying that has become perhaps in some ways more uncertain world or just from that standpoint and you tell me what you think of this doctor Briggs it used to be that we got the truth from three evening newscast and radio and your local newspaper there's usually one\nWe got the truth from three evening newscast and radio and your local newspaper there's usually one I'm most big cities had gone from many down to one\nAnd so you you know if you saw a story and it was the same story on the evening news on the radio and in the newspaper you thought well I Know what's going on these days with the Internet and with all the multiplicity of sources which I enjoy\nUh because I like being able to track well you know this is one version of the story let me read for more and see if they all match up and see where the differences are but that can also lead somebody who say well I don't even know what's true I sat down and write on the Internet research to particular news story or topic\nAnd and I got six different versions and they all seemed to be valid that could lead you to believe that nothing out there is certain\nI think that's true for a you know matters of news and day to day events and politics and the like but uh as far as religion goes here after ... metaphysical\nStarted to your after answering the questions and you can go and read that there's\nYou know differences of opinion and that's always been available for religion I think most people always understood that there were [noise] you know the Hindus and ah and Mormons and the Buddhists and all this kind of thing so that was always there for people to explore if they wanted to\nAnd I think that this is probably at least in America or another reason people are fleeing Christianity is that it [noise]\nIt seemed it seemed to them to be more conservative you know we're sort of breaking a part of the country right now at least as far as the pain is goer bifurcated\nAnd a good reason that people are leaving is that the Christianity seems to say hey look we have these universal ancient truth and if you want to be a Christian you need to hold of some of these is becoming distasteful\nTo a lot of people who don't want to acknowledge those truth\nWell gosh you know I'll admit I have a dog um if I 'cause I'm a Christian but Dr brings I almost get more worried that the religions that go along and get along and say\nOh you can be a Catholic and still believe in abortion you can be a Christian and still you know in other words it's it's it's like ordering at a Chinese restaurant one from column a one from column B and if you don't want anything from columns see you don't have to\nI mean if you're looking for ... to the church says well you don't have to believe in everything we believe in to be able to be you know a Christian or a ... or you know or or Muslim or whatever the Muslims are pretty strong or this is the way it you're going I understand they buy for occasions to\nUh primarily between uh you know Shia and Sunni but but do you think it's the lack of of religions taking a stance and saying this is what we actually stand for and if and\nYou know I think that's absolutely absolutely positively of the largest contributing force Muslims are not a are increasing because of this reason I Know that there are some differences as you say\nBut even though sex or increasing and not just because of a you know increased birth rate there's lots of conversion is being made because uh Muslims are willing to say this is right and there it is right this is wrong this is true this is false\nAnd they're and they're and they're determined and those beliefs\nDr brings it's a pleasure to have you on Dr William ... is a senior writer of
