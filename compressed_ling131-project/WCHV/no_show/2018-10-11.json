should amazing how ... works and does it take much effort to make things happen\nWe'll soon that was the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before they have to be eight no\nFive all work eleven to work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little\nUm but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after I'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week\nAnd that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial when falls or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but at pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur ... are are you sure that this works uh primarily from the field or is there a science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer\nBecause you have these major changes\nWhich are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience\nPeople get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know\nSomething major his change all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future and so in a way that starts\nAll their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future and so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paves the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I was trying to figure out what is it\nIs a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism um that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into\nUm the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group in twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else and she was one of the people who is intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job\nSo can I tell you any everything about how this works\nYou're absolutely not [laughter]\nThere's a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that power of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you\nWhich are convinced that work [noise] aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at it\nStudying groups over years\nUm you know I've run I run these year long master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were going to do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then others summer when the don't get results in the group\nWill I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do is skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away right there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know sought to themselves yeah right\nAnd they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is\nOn here and are you interested in the human\nIt's healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the ...\nOh you mean a physical healing well yeah because it is it's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions we had a woman\nWas stage for cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know

was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so suddenly\nConcert once they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they\nWrite a leader of a story they write in an intro they have to do who what when where and why and how and and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nAnd if a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is\nThey don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so what you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want\nAnd the other thing I notice George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like um I have one group one master class a intention group of eight\nAnd they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery [noise] and I said to them why what\nDo you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child and Joe needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you\nYou know so it's it's really about first of all figuring out what you want\nExactly and then telling ... yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with Lynn Mick Jagger in about intention let's start by going to Thomas ammonia California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb it's really a pleasure of comment and then a question um I was just you know your audio a lecture programs one called living the\nFields and the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player\nI just want you to know that they're just have so much information now you unique about retro causality\nRetro intention and you cite a number of experiments that\nAppear to prove that\nWe can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not fixed in stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite ... how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop semi just rented retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention\nOne I tend to do though is\nYou can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic\nTime being one big smeared out now\nAnd that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that\nAnd this is a weird thing um we don't change the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show\nBut just to answer your question when I tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nTo moment in their health just when something just started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship and it then deteriorated\nAfterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at some things we just just did\nLike that and go back and change your response to that teacher and you say no I'm not used to sit math I just don't understand is now I Will later\nLater something like that or imagine\nThat that healing that that illness\nDoesn't blow up into full blown disease I actually had somebody who got ... from an infection the bank and imagine that time and I swear to you know she told us her skin was starting to re pigment\nIn the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something\nAnd it's in his sense released it for them going forward so it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with ritual intention because even standard physicist now are saying to us all um\nYou know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here a rich go ahead\nYeah hey can you hear me all Gary speaker phone alone good pretty good okay 'cause it's\nKind of hard to hear you I Want to thank you and when I'm your conversation is so right on it's almost like you have\nAll the time let me give you a a thing um I grew up\nKind of Catholic and I heard the story that you know some people will never die in a bar Feinstein says energy on these changes farm so you know that kind of back me

Mick Jagger Glenn in the book the power of age what would you say was the most compelling aspect of it that you came across\n[noise] well I think it was the probably that so many instances killings and I think that it was really shocking to me that\nIt wasn't just health that was healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that um but for instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this\nShe was one of the receivers in a power of a group and she wanted her intention to be that her family's business expand in all directions and be prosperous in all ways\nAnd then she and her husband had a computer support in business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because\nThey had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about\nA decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive so she can't during the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark\nOpening up their car doors and money spilling out\nAnd afterward her feeling about it for fear and her depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she hates as a hobby and she was a given offers to do\nHer painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training folk program that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of age group not only perform magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity and I think\nAnd I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch\nEverything in people's lives begin to heal\nCan you do develop intention in your dreams\n[laughter] that's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know were intending you know somebody calls a dreams R B roll you know we felt weird weird stuff going on there and dreams but\nThey are often times ... cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying you know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow\nI was really interested to find that that\nUm a lot of people a lot of people pre dreamed that nine eleven I'm a ... tax um Rupert shelled rate did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of\nPlanes going into buildings that ... a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank\nAnd the the somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time it's not beyond the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happened were thinking about it\nThe key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his\nIllnesses you know his pain and I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of a group together\nBecause let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill\nThe pain in your you know if you've got a pain in your left so I'm left\nBig toe you know focused on that he really he

you know after they've done the intention maybe they feel a little bit more pain but it usually resolves and it's so much better\nSo I've never had an instance yet where somebody has really got worse

us talk about this uh anyway so hungry litigated but Tom I Want to do what\nA circle back because I don't think you and I've spoken since the Kavanaugh hearings began a and I ... and it's amazing to me that I'm Still amazed at how far afield our public discourse can go every time I think it's gotten weird enough\nAh like when you came to cut the ribbon on Hillsdale driving people were screaming and yelling at\nYou hounding on our car yeah I mean when\nI was one I thought that was a low point but it it just continues to get crazier and crazier\nWell let me do a few things number one I'm going to go completely off the beaten path and say only but you do can use AC DC bumper music and get away with a he's got a brother who is a big wheel and washing out yeah um yeah I don't know if you knew that you hadn't edited and yeah I mean the discourse is terrific I think I'm just the way that\nPeople act I'm so second I'm trying to stay out of the fifth district price but I'm so sick and tired of of ah the Democrat nominee talking about how I'm many Trump I Will tell you this I've spent less time with Donald Trump and she spent all day and to say Hussein\n... she had dinner with them I probably spend Fifteen twenty minutes in the same room with the president not including the state of union and that sort of thing what Mr\nRight after the debate or the Democratic party candidate in some of our Hollywood friends picked up on their three million Twitter followers were you feed a some ridiculous statement that uh because Denver Riggleman Z\nA daughter works to help victims of sexual assault uh they they excerpted in two words out of context\nOr you know in in ... when you have three million followers on Twitter and you're some Hollywood type ... these are battles that don't get on wrong\nWell yeah it's ... look we got to trial coming up with the guy who threatened to adopt\nMutilate torture and murder me because apparently he didn't agree with our political views that's essentially what he said\nUm you know if you go to go track a new check my partisanship writing I'm squarely in the middle I mean a by virtue of my stands on things like who the heck cares what you do behind closed doors and who you do it with so long as you're of age with consent\nAnd they you know ... when when you champion a marijuana reform because you don't think that it's fair that the federal government enforces lousy of some people will not against others\nAnd yet somehow your your your your extreme right and the and the words of of the left ... we've got more votes and the fifth district at any candidate in the history of the fifth district for any office including president by about ten thousand\nRight no I don't do that but but you you think that somehow I was until the sun and again this is I I don't know who who the who the person running for the Democrats in the fifth district thinks they're running against but I'm not on the ballot\nI'm so she should shut her mouth and again contemplate the fact that she spent more time with murders and the rapist named Dayton crusaders saving them brag about it and multiple books on TV that I've spent with Donald Trump or she calls my mentor\nAnd I and I and I've kept my powder dry until this point but let's let's talk about the issues let's look people man I tell them what we're going to do and then do it is what I've done my entire political career and this is shameful\nAnd I you know when you wound an animal that it tends to attend to lash out\nUm but I think it was a guy named Brock Obama who said elections have consequences and and we're going to settle this at the ballot box everybody needs to take a deep breath\nWell do you think that the behavior of you know not just a Leslie but those those she seeks to join in Washington the the Chuck Schumer's uh and and uh Spartacus\nUh although I've taken to calling them ... or Spartacus because I like the movie the bird cage a and I like to think of Cory Booker as a hangs area but in any given a you know the the way these people behaved and the Kavanaugh hearings it seems to have\nSparked something amongst those who voted for the president last year and I don't mean just the two years ago I don't mean just Republicans I'm Talking about the Democrats were like\nYeah we had an of Obama voters voted for Trump right it or they stabbed before one in five\n... and I think more of them are in this walk away movement than ever before we visited with the guy runs walk away in the Potomac area\nAh and he he's been doing events with the Tea Party from up there because this is a group of people are like this government has just gotten out of control I'm In a way that is dangerous ...\nThey lie and they ... to find words out of your people describe Cory Booker is a moderate why because they say so and then I get attacked for being a feeling of the Freedom Caucus let me be clear there's one reason well to\nFill it with three in the summer when I said I Would be when I was asking I keep my word and number two it's the only group in Washington it seems to give a dad go on about the profligate spending that will eventually\nDestroyed this America that we've been given by people who worked sweated bled\nOf all colors shoes and and and faiths are ... and and and and but somehow that you know that that's the mantra extreme extreme extreme extreme on and what not wasting money on up through all that money after good on on things that have repeatedly failed\nI agree with you I I still find that to be fascinating that the Tea Party was a broken away from that that very simple taxed enough already a move but I think the the walk away folks are are very much what what about this and I was telling you a little bit about this guy who was caught with the two hundred pound bomb\nA but it ties into the the Bernie Sanders guy that shot up the softball\nI'm a ... you you mentioned the court case we're certainly this isn't political discourse anymore this is\nI Want a riot to keep you down we have a a fellow here who went to an album rural school board meeting a and got a threatened by you know fifty people in the parking lot because he said you you can't limit people's free speech rights just because you don't like the Confederate flying I mean where does it end or does it end in something horrific happening\nI mean you know the percentage of Republican elected members of the house and Senate\nWho've been hospitalized in the last fourteen months makes it more dangerous than being a police officer for Thirty years it ... in the United states right as far as acts of violence and these are both politically motivated attacks I speak of ... and a staffer who was shot\nAt and Rand Paul ...\nAnd it but apparently that's not enough right so I've been saying this and I'll say it again or there are a myriad of reasons that I'm delighted to be leaving that place called Washington number one my first allegiance should be but it hasn't been out to my family and myself as it relates to doing the right thing to get get myself in in my family where we need to be\nAnd number two it's not it is but one something horrible happened to them when I got there I thought there's things I Can't talk about on this and I thought that it might be a some sort of terror attack in the end sooner or later it will be\nWell as an alarm clock functions so it's back to the good old days of clock radio so you don't have to wake up to some annoying a pre packaged technological sound\nYou can actually listen up to the dulcimer tones of your very most favorite his radio show host or certainly uh me too I of course understand my world I'm waking up to go stories and alien abductions but that's just because I get up at Zero Dark thirty\nIn the morning coming up tomorrow and mackerel Haiti is going to join us she's one of the investigative journalist that on earth the Kermit ... story and I got to once again big ups to the stone field stadium fourteen folks I don't know who makes the management decision but that was the place where\nUm death of a nation got some screen time in Charlottesville for a couple of weeks and they will be showing guys now tonight starting at seven forty tonight\nUm and uh but don't sleep on this stuff 'cause it death of a nation was only really here for a couple of weeks at the stone field stadium fourteen\n... ironically within walking distance of our local Planned Parenthood folks but and macro any is going to join us also a doctor Robert Epstein or what are the folks who did the research behind a creepy line which is out\nOn Amazon Prime uh giving you a ticket\nUh giving you tickets or wild to our battle of the bronze listening for your chance calling to get that or if you get free tickets but you got to help me with a fundraising once you're they're raising money for the flourish boutique let me get some emails coming in this one from sue\n\nAfter listening to our visit with Tom Garrett she said the Democrats couldn't get gun control laws passed so now they're pressuring banks like Citibank bank of America not to lend money to sellers and manufacturers have guns and ammo will sue it's even worse than that some of them are saying we won't even process so if\nYou have a credit card from I think bank of America's toll credit or they will not processed purchases of guns would their credit card\nOut now to their credit Wells Fargo has said exactly the opposite so are they are um Obama called that sue goes on to write operation chokehold\nThis is coming at the same time the left is encouraging violence against the rest of us in form of ... and other radical groups we need to be able to defend ourselves more than ever\nWas even more over the net sue ah I've I open a can of worms again yesterday the young the story of the woman from Guatemala\nAre here are worth her weight and ... or whatever it is a member of the movie with the bird cage\nA this Guatemalan woman seeking refuge after passing all these US embassies in Mexico\nAnd Texas and Louisiana in Tennessee and she's now here in Charlottesville all the way from Guatemala because Mexican asylum isn't as good as American or certainly central Virginian asylum but she's here are seeking asylum because thugs in her home country wanted her land\nSo in an effort to take it they burned her home down in it so if you take that story at face value say well this is the kind of thing that had Guatemala had a Second Amendment\nShe'd have been able to put a couple of a extra breathing holes in the in these folks if they tried to do when they do or property\nShe then also goes on to say you know on the news story that there's several of these white nationalist one visit with the\nUs attorney Colin\nTomorrow morning of these folks from California that were here a white supremacist groups a white nationalist groups or whatever I'm In Charlottesville facing charges now well there's another story in the daily progress this morning sue probably trigger you as well\nAs the appeals are going on and a couple of the guys who were arrested for taking the tarps down\nA Wayne and Christopher Wayne of Richmond and what is the other guy I'm from Lambert\nBut they are in Charlottesville circuit court Wednesday or not guilty pleas and ah they're moving forward but the miss application or the incomplete application of justice a\nWho was salts David Dukes Mary Annette out in front of Charlottesville city hall and I'm Sorry I'm not giving them any more ... than that I don't know ... just because their ass hats doesn't mean we have to be proud of assets that are opposing them I I I Will choose a third way\nBut just because one ass hat assaulted the other as hat and

with us um and and I wanted to talk about\nThe importance of this race cars you send out a message after the cabin on\nUm a appointment and the swearing in is that you know they're still more\nAre coming from the Supreme Court when there are still lots more court a with judge ships being filled by the Senate as well talk about the importance of keeping the majority in the Senate or to the even just level headed December my conservative Republicans anymore just you know seen people\nWell yeah when you got that Cory Booker Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris wing of the Democratic party that's going to screen for what they're going to screen or in already are screaming or on the national front\nA it is obviously important pick up some Senate seats across the country wherever we can get them and obviously from our perspective the more conservative better\nAnd they're good prospects of doing that right now Kevin Cramer is not really conservative but he's Republican looks like it's well ahead of camping North Dakota\nI'm both Arizona and Nevada\nRepetitive those are the most likely seats for Republicans still is we're not doing anything there because Dean Heller mix Sally or not conservative I'm chewing\nRepublican seats where the Senate concerts on his activists Tennessee where we talked about already you know Marsha Blackburn selected she'll be the most conservative woman in the Senate ever um which would be a great addition and you know things like the Kavanaugh hearings only drive at home\nUm and then\nTexas Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke is raising more money than all other Democrat challengers in the United states combine while and um it is amazing I mean that the amount of money and the Texas race has been astonishing and that Ted Cruz\nIt is amazing I mean that the amount of money and the Texas race has been astonishing and Ted Cruz is the only incumbent we're supporting and uh for obvious reasons he's so good on on every issue\nUm and he's willing to fight the leadership when they're wrong and not that that happened not bend [laughter] and um oh don't you know that's\nA whole nother story and their ten Democrat senators defending seats in states that Trump won we're supporting five of those ten and um you know it's an incredible map\nFor Republicans and I I Know in Virginia we uh we we we we follow the course of course race with Tim Kaine and ordering would be a much better as well and and that goes without saying\nIn Tommy news has been acting like somebody who's all of a sudden got some very bad polling numbers no they haven't been public polling numbers but he has he has turned the the night cruise boost on his campaign so I don't know\nIf ... you know shoe leather approach who's been going but he's been making the most out of a couple of hundred thousand dollars\nA raised a so far and uh and I'd see it seems like Tim Kaine has been sweating a whole lot more but you I mean John James I met John James's C pac\n... and here's a guy in Michigan running against Debbie Stabenow a you know John James ... awesome candidate a and and you brought up to other places that are one Claire McCaskill is another case where I how's Josh Hawley doing in that race can how can we know\nJosh Hawley egg\nIn public polling continues to show just a little bit of ... within the margin\nBut he is on the outside\nI'm McCaskill has more money\nOr that is truly a race where he can just stay competitive he's never going to have as much money as she does but if he can just stay competitive on the money front shouldn't win that race yeah and um that's true in Indiana with Mike Braun overtaking Joe Donnelly\nUm and just yesterday we saw\nPulling from West Virginia that has Patrick Morrisey within one point of Joe mansion and um ... some of the left these\nUm or ticket mansion for voting for Kavanaugh which is a joke anyway because he literally waded in the wings serving waiting in the wings until Susan Collins cast your vote so he knew he didn't matter\nBut some of his left wing base voters had moved to a libertarian in the race they're not voting for Morsi but they're also not voting for mansion and it remains to be seen\nWhether they keep holding their breath in the corner is Joe Manchin all the way through election day but um and Matt Rosendale creeping up in Montana state auditor there were just starting that campaign in Montana and um and you mentioned John James as well and so there's opportunities\nFor the Senate map on the Senate map are really very good\nThe the the challenges there's so many of them with really good conservative candidate that you end up not getting to other races live ... ... is a fine candidate in Wisconsin where Trump won\nA she's a state senator who was the leading edge all the fights earlier this decade against unions and for budget a balancing rarely and and uh everything Scott Walker was doing shit\nEight against unions and for budget a balancing rarely and and um everything's Scott Walker was doing she was part of the engine behind that\nAnd um and yet she's struggling with um with\nBaldwin who is always a fairly weak income then but Wisconsin is a tough state\nAnd um you know we need a little more we need a little more detail and for\nFor candidates like Leah ... mayor I and I and the same is true here in Virginia I mean do you what what would benefit corny more than anything is is a bigger shift coming out of cabinet that Virginia is kind of a unique animal because of the D.C suburbs\nYeah we got a lot of federal employees that don't like the swamp dreaming that's going on I can but that said also the seventh district I Know that you don't weigh in on house races except when the seventh district of Virginia a and that raises gotten the ugly as as has the fifth district race\nIt really cool program this community and I'll let them described it to you so I have had the killings from Georgia's healing house and a representative from the volunteer team

da\nAnd when I Walk like it's coming from all these individuals' sources and all look like it's real\nAnd then sure enough they leak that's their insurance policy that struck him page talked

with Rod Rosenstein you have now three people\nFor people as of today that are now saying Rod Rosenstein absolutely men at when he talked about wearing a wire on the president to get the president to

that it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders are in the eyes a database I'm not sure there's anything I could speak to\nAnd they don't send in Republican it's been reported in the Washington Post about two years ago there were Fifteen hundred times in which the president in this was when Obama was president ah was minimize meaning the yes you are gathering up so

they end up using the bought and paid for Tony Russian dot the aid that its own author doesn't stand by\nIt was used before the election to secure Pfizer warrant against the Trump campaign associate

they didn't do it once they did it four times\nIt is unbelievable the abuse of power\nAnd then they they leak disinformation Brennan and company\nAll to influence the American people with lies and propaganda misinformation before the last election then when they lose the election well in comes the insurance policy and immediately strategy and the media league strategy is oh let's just create the impression that all those horrible stuff happen with Russia and none of it did\nI say that we what we did have a plan of Donald Trump didn't accept the results of the electorate meanwhile they had a plan you know they never had a plan or thought that Donald Trump would win that's why I keep saying to you that in twenty seven days you have the power to shock the world again\nAmerica now needs

seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com how's this for a conspiracy theory we've actually use that as tonight's Twitter poll question we try to make a question out of each and every day's news\nAnd some days is more interesting than others but this one is intriguing should President Trump\nHas talked about Jeff Sessions possible replacement\nWith some obsessions subordinates and I imagine this you're working at any job and the boss comes down and talk to people who work for you under you\nAnd he's saying who do you think we ought to replace Larson with when we get rid of them that kind of thing the Washington Post the venerable Washington Post and left leaning so they're never going to paint Trump gonna favorable light reports\nPresident Trump talked recently was Jeff Sessions' own chief of staff about replacing sections as attorney general according to people who've been briefed on the conversation signaling the president remains keenly interested\nIn getting rid of his top law enforcement officials the conversation between ... a Trump President Trump and Matthew would occur as seems somewhat nebulous it was not clear for example whether would occur would take on an interim\nJob as attorney general or be nominated in a more permanent capacity or how definitive the president's intentions were on a long list of indignities that section has endured from his boss Trump's discussing replacing him with his very on top paid kind of stands out\nOn the other hand I Want to give you a perspective on this\nBecause I'm not a legal expert enough certainly never served in office like this\nBut Jeff Sessions has deeply disappointed almost every conservative I Know that I've had the opportunity to talk to in fact every time we take the show on the road Washington DC a wind up talking to members of Congress and their staff\nI ask them what the heck is that what Jeff Sessions\nHe comes into the job and everybody I think almost every conservative thought very well of Senator Sessions he seemed to have a steel backbone he seemed to have a real command of all the issues that he took on and it gets into this job and all of a sudden he\nDisappears it's like he's not there anymore because he had to recuse himself and we've talked about whether or not there was actually good legal reason to recuse himself from the Russia investigation which led

and emails we'll get to that Kanye West have\nJust a little bit later on this hour but ah I've got Frank ... with many who's a a foundation professor at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed this ... welcome to the program thanks for the John\nLarson thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of the president but frankly I I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we needed\nAbsolutely right I mean we were bound for stagnation remember when people talked about ... percent groping the new normal now we've got four percent yup it said it could never happen and we at a\nI'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by you know really nice people but they just were up to the struggle of take it on to them you\nThey weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he we we are getting rid of him eventually I mean now at the end of the year\nUh but but this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nThe disruptor cat food they write you know and the thing about and I'm Glad you mentioned Paul Ryan I couldn't agree more as a thing as the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I worked on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president and I I I ... we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all races creed and all that I mean but we're looking after the people who have been left behind\nAnd I you know I'm I'm afraid that the kind of internationalist wing of the Republican Party all in favor of you know free trade agreements and and all of that they had lost touch with them and and then the end\nYou know we succeeded I'll tell you one thing about the book I debate left wing earth and and they say workers kind of we own that word and I say you know you used to there used to be a Democratic Party\nThat looked after ordinary people and that was not both parties but you've given that up and you know what we ate their lunch\nIn fact doesn't it seem and I I look I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man working woman\nI keep wondering uh policies they adopt\nSeemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of folks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the mid sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well\nAnd and so there there it's the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nBy the way that's up from about fifty six thousand above five years back I mean we're we're doing pretty good I mean the wages are going up but you know the thing about the the dams is they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with it in terms of of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans in a you know who who are are misled into voting for these guys\nYou don't miss dramatically you just said something that made me think from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and sometimes they're used terminology ... that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms and one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that\nFor my audience the way you see it\nAll I Want to hear from the dams um you know you start by saying what's their race what their gender and so on\nAnd uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong race or the wrong grander that does to your your your there they're not terribly interested in you but mostly you know it means that they're obsessed with you know critical concerns like\nTransgender bathrooms bicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job or I Know it's out the oil worker who's who's worried about about you know what regulations are doing to the economy\nSo you know they they've gotten invested in frivolous concerns of the people who got you know who made it\nMade me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason University School the school of law and the author most recently\nUsually the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed\nI I think you've spoken to something is really important because\nWhen you become an a lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I'll make the house payment this month of the car payment or can we really afford to take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class\nAnd so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to build in or out in pretend that you care about that coal miner who's being booed Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job for ... running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left this is where the the series justified as sad and it's where\nThere was this big old union battled back in the Nineteen thirties and Pete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I I thought this is great you know I Know which side of the elite is on I saw the coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump so you know\nBut you know talking about the elite I Love you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway I'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to class 'cause I got these relatives who are working on the assembly line in Detroit and I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently was telephone injustice what how does that figure into the whole equation the oil and\nYou know I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works Russia is before a judge reaches a verdict pill form of the you know the party bosses Neal communist days you'd say what should I Do right so the telephone you know using the telephone to determine what was going to be the result\nAnd I said you know in America we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law in Russia we got too much but here we got we got to search going on for the great Trump defendants and and you know mostly is is just kind of ordinary strollers like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of\nThe line for the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause\nI don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talked to the right to tell the Russian ambassador is going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI does that say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have\nEvery jot until from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into a into a process crime\nSo you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement as the FBI confident talks in most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly wherever we are in the country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate said Frank 'cause I've had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents\nTop sheriff's deputies you hate to start acting like when the police show up for the FBI shows have you say I should treat them like a treat the G are you if I was a a an an occupation of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party\nTo tell the president who should be there and you heard a lot of that language of the last week well he may be qualified but he's not the right man for the job\nWell the person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president the Senate can say this president you nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her but in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply a from that and put 'em on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one democratic voting the right way now I mentioned this\nLittle off it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump sitting behind a resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk from him\nAnd Donald Trump listening for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes now I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy\nNow why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy all I'm find to be put I'm I'm okay with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit\nUh I have a conversation that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of people have okay say you know first of all in a letter to a lot of jobs are so the fathers of the job and they say we're getting more money for have more\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute in the eighties and then I and\nThe prisoner re just shot a\nShot right which is actually far harder it's going down right now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problem area and saw the super\n... says while the ...\nSo uh I think it's the way\nGives you power in a way he's talking about the hat that does keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan and he's saying this how gives you power and\nWhy you know my dad and my mom separated so I have a lotta male energy in my home and also a ... a\nMale and doing all that you know everyone but a cat has just made me feel that the guy they get all the time like the guy\nSaw it was something that is how it made me feel like Superman made a Superman that they are now\nThat's Kanye West saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero\nI Know that a lot of the left to sit this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to he says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said to young women\nHave more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and none of that ... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say that programs that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them\nAnd you make Superman case for me it got it looks as you look around ...\nAt that point I didn't believe that one out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was one I miss but I I dropped that one out because yeah he was sitting in the oval office Kanye West managed to drop a couple of swear words\nBut his message was all conservative and this is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who was both black\nAmerican and successful it's sitting there in front of the president of the United states saying I admire what you've done I support what you've done I'm wearing this hat it turns into Superman and wanting the world is wrong with

completely different level it seem last night as good as he's been in the past and incredible game out of him in a four point effort setting up Alex Ovechkin for do we fix up one of his own got to be one of the best players only right now given what we saw last night\nThat he had a standing game last night and he's had a really strong camp I'm right from the the first minute they got back into Washington he was a ready to pick up where he left off and the last year which was a obviously had an extremely high levels so\nUm you know happy with a thought just as off into play but some things he's doing is helping out in our power only kill but here as well and and adding a U.S some different elements to to uh is overall game which is a fun to watch\nIt's good to see Michael kept me back at her last I'd had a couple of murder penalties but what was your evaluation of his return on the line up last night yeah I think\nHe was this skating as noticeable um\nAnd it it's a different maker so um you know not many guys can a skate like that and certainly I think it's usually served for a a good partnership with John as an as in the past and um you know I think uh um you know as he gets a further along here and gets more comfortable with everything he he'll settle into some things but ah [noise]\nUm I I like the first game than the obviously hasn't played for a while and then after some times in one of those that type of an upper body Andrew sometimes there are some tentative ... site and see it and then see any of that at all so I thought he had a\nA good game and it was a ...
