estate on the exchanges or Georgia Tech\nAnd exactly jolly while I was getting a couple of fresh defensive ends in there\nSo this particular series on the bows and there was a\nI'll be a six yard game to the Virginia tech thirty eight guidelines\nThat could end for they need the thirty four to the yellow jackets they lead thirty\nFive and I want to censor the bias Oliver dies Memphis ... straight

certainly most of the other hand off and other Utah Mason through at contacted at the five spin through that contact of Diablo\nYeah you know we really the way they were attacking us we want to try to get our edge guy to get up the field and turn the quarterback back inside and and we did that just before half\nThat kept that ate up a couple of blockers and kept her Mike clean and I'm actually see we should have we should have a defensive tackle or a linebacker so many that should be free\nIf they're blocking the way they're blocked they were loaded up there should be somebody from the inside out you know the only thing is that what they did they loaded it up and they were just able to keep running outside and keep running away from those guys and\nYou know we've got to go back and look and see maybe our our support could have been better\nYou know from the perimeter but it's so they did a nice job just getting numbers and loading us up and um\nAnd get on the ground and and making place it's hard to get tackles for last year one opportunity there and Ricky I thought he was thinking scooping scored yeah we actually jumped on it well that's the one thing these guys put the ball in the ground twenty two times probably going into this game\nAnd that was the one they put on the ground and obviously a the ball kind of roll back in the dirt directions that out in space and and um

again we're just so they played talking day being Georgia Tech played outstanding in in uh like I said they the bottom line they controlled was grim which\nThey they beat us up on the line of scrimmage and that's the bottom line well how about going forward from here it's not going to get easier job you know also cause with Dylan and yeah ... yeah well you know I Know a\n... he's been hurt the running back down you know I Know they're counting on him to get back in a\nI'm going to be a lot of saying they're going to draw the line up and man handlers and we got to come back and have a big time we can practice I think\nYou know food hit it with the with them in the locker room we've talked about we've\nYou know we've got to the kids have to buy into the process you know because we won last week doesn't mean it was just it was we're going to go do it again you know it was a it was it wasn't pretty last week and we had a fighter tail off or sixty minutes but\nWe've got to learn to come out every day and work to improve and I think they've got to buy into that process that you've ... at this level there's such a fine line and that fine line as you go out prepare your opponent you go out and work your opponent during the week\nYou just don't show up in on Saturdays and assume that's going to happen you got to go do it Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and then get ready to go do it on friday and then that's that's where our younger or young kids I think\nYou know they want to believe and they're wanting to but being consistently good is that that still the they've got to buy into that process that uh you know at this level it's a fine line 'cause there's water there's eighty five scholarships on the other side of the middle of the field to in a\n... and and that's where we got to separate ourselves from it through our work ethic and through a preparation so\nUh and and improving its just not working it's improving and that's what we can do this is a unique game because of the fence and they did a great job I talked to a ball afterwards you know I've got a lot of respect for him and\nI said hey you kicked our daily said you guys you know you said\nYou saw the good Georgia Tech teen and I said I don't know from week to week who who's going to show up for us and\nBut he says you got our good Georgia Tech team and and they played that weight

I think twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars and how that the bank to bar over droughts and stuff so that could uh\n... while the bank charge you or anything if there was a dinner they will\nBe it well it was ... that was charged to our account\nOr no but if it's identity theft or bank shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and I said there was nothing they could do about it\nA rock and change but\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card debt I'm if I'm One of those little Walmart hard you know so we don't even go through the banks\nBanking and we just have a debit card that I'm just like one of those little Walmart hard you know\nSo we don't even go through the banks anymore\nIt's just a debit card but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars and overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm but\nI'm near in that time because that was going on we got behind\nOn our house payment and I'm a couple of more thanks for the smaller notice that we had well we got the smaller and I said but we're still have a hand on our house I've talked to the house and loan people and they're working with us\nBut we're having to pay extra amount sonar mortgage payment\nSure how old are you going to\nFifty nine so I'm fifty nine and he's sixty and mom Seventy nine of\nThem are you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nYes it's a disability all three of us and none of you were able to work you\nKnow I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that what is the nature of your disability um man is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he\nHad um he has a head and broke his back and he has a um\nA piece of the bone that somebody can close to his nerves back then he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat the later and mhm so he's got like twenty five percent of his heart is beaten so\n... ... ... um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crushes right due to the sixth and gum and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you've kind of started doing there with the crouch\nAnd even in his shoes obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could do like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and showing it on ...\nFor a dollar and two dollars ... she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that doesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously it involves a keystroke on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only ... ... your world it would change your life\nMhm wouldn't it it really well I guess or be dramatic and hold his mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her eleven forty seven yeah she passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here mhm um and how much is your house\nUm they were four Seventy eight but they've increased it to five\nSo that was that's one of those on your nails that's just due to taxes and insurance going\nUp with a wreck so you know and what's the homework\nOh it's worth a ride at a hundred and ten a hundred and ...\nWe only oh twelve five on it I don't want to go to the you know we had it paid off sure would be good when mhm yeah\nI think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some\nThey ate out sure would be good when mhm yeah so\nI think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do\nI you're obviously not going to do anything that's physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that and I'm not picking on\nYou know I'm just trying to help you are but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem in right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change you feel\nLike you were rich like you were multi millionaires or something it would change your life that\nMuch and so in is that possible yes that is possible very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to\nPut a bunch of strain on you physically\nBut um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have been told your conversation was on my own sell them something right and that that's possible thing you can do um you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand dollars a month that would change your world and that's\nThat's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem that you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband and you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here and it would change everything for you I thank you for the call open phones a AAA eight to five\nFive and two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nToday and how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's\nSo my wife and I graduated college about\nA little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes are definitely getting on that but we paid it off about half the best point I'm\nI'm Wondering in your eyes or your parents or a financial perspective it a good time to attack I think at night and kids because she the wife's getting credit pushy and that is I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one that won a kid's faster than sharing a shot of several she won but I'm a I I don't think that there is a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but\nAre you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to be ready to have kids in God's says it's okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people they need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids um you know you don't have to be in a certain place\nYou're going to be fine a child is not to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of it\nIt's yeah it's really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point\nAnd so the actual cost of a kid is just not that it's not devastating but again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape\nFinancially smart and you're already moving in the right direction you want to start now it doesn't bother me at all this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that

twenty five years old and\nI'm buying a house is not a bad thing or your first goal is you know when you're working on it is to get clear the death the second goal is to have your emergency fund of

fixed\nRate and where the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay now my guess is that is going to be pretty limited on the house that you buy with your income\nYeah it's a hobby I guess I get paid you know ... and every other week and I take 'em you know without overtime or anything like that yeah around eight hundred bucks or so\nUm for a week or ... or ... you can only watch them

Olympics they face it on Twitter you know telling us people that we've had a young man of media\nOutlets are here in Los Angeles who changed his mind about abortion we'd have very young girl who had been very ... definitely pro choice people have written stories about her now who said that this singlehandedly this still singlehandedly changed her mind about abortion\nYou know we both have people who had abortions you've seen the film and you know who have written to us and I think to some thanks very very much for making the cells so\nI think we've done something that's that's quite unique here you know I'm\nOne of the things that was a there was a split very unusual that the case was that the\nThe the the jury needed to have and the difference between a legal abortion\nAnd murder explained for them that distinction needs to be explained to them so you know in the in the movie that's one of the things that we saw with very important to represent that big of a I think it has never been told in the movie before so we basically took the trip ... transcript the testimony from the\nYou know legal abortion list and had some ... in the in that it's in the movie\nWhere they describe the good abortion and as opposed to murder and I can tell you that the jury alone with alone with the audience at the year that I think I don't I don't see a difference\nIn my mind works in weird ways and mackerel Haiti or one of the investigative journalist that brought Kermit God's nails horrors to ah to the sunlight and then lead to a ... on the screen at this\nInvestigative journalists that brought Kermit God's nails horrors to uh to the sunlight and then lead to a ... on the screen at the stadium fourteen in here it's stone field um this through this week at least um\nAnd if you keep going senior their business people if people are filling the theaters most cases except for like an said they'll keep it there are but we\nWe're actually talking about this regarding drugs in the war on drugs in the last segment and um I think the that we've created this to boo around for the abortion really is\nThat we're not allowed to talk about it so it almost creates the fertile garden where a guy like ... can be this horrific serial killer hiding under this guys over\n... you can't talk to me I'm ... I'm going to abortion clinic and do you have a right to do this in a row the weight and\nAnd and it's created this world where polite people don't want to talk about what's really going on but then it ... it empowers somebody like ... to to ah get is nuts on\nYeah no you're absolutely right you're you're absolutely correct that you know he gets he gets to you know he got he got away with murder basically ... years most because of the fact that it would have with abortion and its hands off abortion you can't do anything\nAnd I you know it's tragic actually realize\nThat if it's a Republican governor governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania who who kind of has a hands all over the case he he you know he ran on a pro choice chicken came to the governor of Pennsylvania and said hands off of the abortion clinic\nAnd so for Seventeen years Seventeen years not abortion so that was not inspected and if anyone had expected that you know to find the\nChats walking around in the procedure rooms\nAnd all the rest of all the rest of the stuff of what's going on in the seat that but they didn't bother you know I think the fact is that the reason that you say you know at the same time as his portions and it wasn't getting inspected you have a nail salon things being inspected\nAnd barred downwind and restaurants\nSo you know that the the there's a there's there is some kind of cover up in general these abortion clinic which which do you know it does bring up a lot of very interesting question the question that people need to be asking if people want to ignore this subject people don't like if you don't like thinking\nIf I just don't think by the ... you know people really do need to think about entering gauge or nothing will ever change\nAnd let me ask you this as well on top of this because in find it on Twitter at guys know movie or write letters working people send a letter if they were impacted ... let me just to ... you mentioned lots of\nFolks who sending letters where's the best place for them to send those letters of somebody here was impacted by seeing yeah we are now taking\nSo they can they can write privately owned like on the Facebook page and pick what it costs the movie Facebook page that's a place to write and they can write you know I'm a direct message to to last that nobody else can see but they could also right public they on the page but they could offer right privately I mean and we have had I mean we could get it published a book of of letters from people\nThat have been very very powerfully impacted by the story and some people put their stories up on the federal Twitter but some people to put them up on Facebook but some people as I said a privately written to him about how much this is meant to them and how how glad they are that we made us and how they've come back twice or three times to see the cell where we've had a lot of people saying that\nI'm sure I think the feeling that go to a very long life actually I think people it's going to have an impact for a very very long time\nWell I remember the first time you and sell them came on the program and we were talking about this and it struck\nMe that it it's sad that\nIf you listen to the abortion advocates they still run back to where they were in the seventies when I was a kid and when roe v Wade was you know ruling the Supreme Court that this is going to protect women from back alley abortions\nThese when I was a kid and when roe v Wade was you know rules and the Supreme Court that this is going to protect women from back alley abortions and that's exactly what it drove them to that this was actually the kind of horrors that we're trying to supposedly save us from right\nYeah yeah and I think you know I think that's an awful lot of disingenuous\nAnd communication from the Planned Parenthood pro abortion people you know why or why all the secrecy why is that we don't know why it most people in America don't know the low in America white uh most people don't know\nThat you're going to abortion with the low in America and that you go to a portion of nine months way that people don't do that white people don't know\nHow it's done how do they do this ... how do they do this the second trimester or the third trimester you must talk about it and by the way it's nothing wrong with the ... of the White House why doesn't everyone know firefighters\nAnd if we talk about secrecy is very helpful by the way to Planned Parenthood it's very helpful if you ... and if it's ... the subject and\nYou know and have people think

I don't view it'd be a monumental task I Would imagine but at what point do we need to start screening male or at least packages the same way that people get screened before they go on an airplane or or is that a ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's\nWhere is that a ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's come out of this case and I'm surprised that they don't do it more often I Know FedEx and UPS\nOr do some kind of screening and to try and determine what they're shipping\nBut the U.S postal service handling billions of pieces of mail a year it may be much more of a difficult task but you would think that if you're going to implement that type of procedure you would start so with packages and work your way back to potentially envelopes and or anthrax\nDetective risk and that's exactly what I'm thinking of and I know that I fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the to some extent that thing is color coded it makes me think that\nMay be an automated system could at least spot some of the more obvious ones because I you know I Know that some of this is a closely held piece of information but I Know just by looking at the system\nThat things show up differently on that screen depending on what kind of material they're looking at it are they looking at fabric or they're looking at mental are they looking at the inside of a laptop and what does a legitimate laptop battery looked like and what does the laptop battery look like and what does a ... piece of plastic pipe look like if it's\nFilled with some kind of powder I mean it could be ... or could be full of explosives\nAnd I would imagine in this day and age uh we've got such good technological tools that you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria kicked out on the side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIs an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that before should\nLook at an airport when you when I go through the screener\nAnd no matter what ... Iran it goes there if something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it out of the machine kicks it out of the conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt I don't know why we couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nAnd you wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know that a computer never gets tired you know if it's scanning looking for particular characteristics it never gets tired and never has been off day had him never has the day when you didn't get your second cup of coffee and the computers should and now I'm not saying the machines are everything\nBut if if you need to scan hundreds of thousands of baggage is I don't know how you could do it unless you had an army of people saying they're looking at screens all day\nWhere you wouldn't do it we don't do it at the airport where we do is we have a screener who is alerted by it the computer screen that there's something\nThat calls for secondary screening at that with this package and that's what kicks it out so if you're a package was delayed by or if my package was delayed by a day or so I wouldn't mind if it needs a secondary screening and therefore was put into separate line\nAnd had to then be done by a human or even a second machine to us to a third\nPoint where a human then looks at it because I think that the safety of our postal employees and the people who are delivering the mail and people where it's going into a male Roman circle buildings around this country\nYou know the safety of our people in our citizens are paramount to law enforcement as well as everyone else in this country\nNicely said now tell me that is what else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law and\nOh tell me that is what else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law enforcement can come on someone who is looking to do us harm and\nHow quickly law enforcement agencies around this country this happened to be cool does the NYPD the FBI\nAnd the joy terrorists task force and the postal inspectors but you know it it shows what law enforcement around this country and what cops do every single day and every single jurisdiction to keep our people safe and how quickly they'll find you if you plan to\nDo an act of terrorism in this country and threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction\nThe police will get you they will arrest you and you will spend the rest of your life in jail\nSay Iraq is now looking at fifty eight years with just the five charges they've charged with today I think they'll add additional charges other things are failed it will be a life sentence either way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years is a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it if not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know and I know you're not you know in the position that crime lab is do you think he intended for any of these to go up or merely to have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nYou're asking for something that goes way outside of our usual behavior I mean most of the\nTea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and in D.C on television they were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example of January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration\nThe crazy women's march ... you know the\nFact is there's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally an equitable okay it's already in the law was would you like and we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\nAlthough I said I wanted to mention visit Madonna telling telling us show of support Trump and that's not wacko\nIs often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well\nAnd yet you know that if a Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in it a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become\nBecause we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off and the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories\nIs that when I went from being a reporter on both television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers in people I knew who say you're concerned of and I said yeah\nI'm a conservative ... well I never knew that\nAnd I said what did you think I was a wife you worked on television I thought you were a liberal I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do\nThe other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard or in other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does\nPrecisely the same thing or something so similar there is nearly identical we're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one was Fox on one with CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z\nAnd I thought during the entire eight years of Obama I never once saw them say with no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the but there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when ... where one broad Obama was asked\nJuno that the IRS has been going out and denying us\nWhen when ... where one blog Obama was asked\nJuno that the IRS has been going out and denying as conservative groups free speech rights by denying their applications for tax free status all he had no clue what he said oh the first I knew about it was one I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat was a bold faced lie you can't make us you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet and then turn around and say\nNo I was completely clueless as ... and I made the point of the the president of the United states should be arguably one of the best informed people on the planet he\nHas put tunes of people around him from all these different agencies whose entire job is together every important piece of data in the world even stuff that that secret and then to boil it down\nTo just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran and we're going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him\nAnd say this is what you need to know how could a guy who's so well informed claim to be so ignorant of what was going on in the only answer is he was lying and yet I never saw CNN or MSNBC or near the rest of those ... or the New York times say the president claimed\nWithout in any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on to the ... during fast and furious or the IRS during a the the cheating on conservative groups he had no idea that the EPA was out taking actions that would lead to the release of toxic contaminants into the Animas River\nHe had a in other words according to Morocco Obama bronco bomber was arguably the single most clueless president in American history if you believed his denial of that that's what's going on in any case at least the man is in custody he has been charged with crimes\nThat give convicted will put him away Caesar say they'll put them away for the rest of his natural life\nWe've got a lot to

I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both insulated and kept the juice worried belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't do great in the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nDo you are absolutely right that the the other thing is that a policed Irene a generates less waste water and also occupies less space in the landfill\nPolice tiring a generates less waste water and also occupies less space and landfill and the other thing is that we have we now have bacteria that will degrade a Styrofoam and and other plastics in the landfill so\nYou know that this that these objections these attempts to band things are just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology it go fundamentalists\nHey I Want to ask you about something else 'cause about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we're talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia\nOr we're seeing a stuff come through that's that's a marijuana get shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship\nAnd I asked him we had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that go through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid that liquid or possibly explosive you know I don't know what color explosive comes up as ... I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through\nBut my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said\nIf you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carries\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that\nThey may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicked set aside and and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... and red flag and pass a law or in fact it's my understanding that checked\nBaggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strained just doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters or could probably sail through and then maybe do it just for packages that's a very good idea or as\nI just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket suing kill all the\nSalmonella or the other bacteria or the ... it's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all but it was ... a lot of the contamination and probably for lettuce and salads because it seems like every other week I'm hearing about some other kind of solid product it's making people sick and I keep thinking you're radiation good solved that but\nYou know will trigger the bears to act aggressively\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts and Virginia Auburn the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try to keep him confined up there\nAnd try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know ah go ... on a\nBoard member from a jails to try to get you know our catcher in the release program to complete it at our local jail but you know aside from those nuts um yeah we we are short a few nuts in this town and I and cross for ... Virginia and the mid Atlantic is is seeing this for quite a bit a\nWith their anti are coming to the side of the road\nSo maybe more hunting do you suppose that's a positive I mean you get ... I went archery hunting for the first time this year I've been ... modern rifle before that and I wouldn't want to shoot a rifle in places is crowded with humanity is the commonwealth is but I wouldn't mind going back and trying to put an arrow in a beer or two but as you say that's been restricted as well\n[noise] ... yeah and and with the national park or running along skyline drive a there's so much protected area where it's very restricted um the bears be obese survival is they know where it's safe they know where this\nUh there's so much protected area\nWhere it's very restricted um the bears will be survival is they know where it's safe they know where the family is you know this family grows larger and larger and larger uh it uh\nIt's just going to keep you know you multiplying itself uh so I think you know good management of heard you're a hunter you understand that probably the best your natural is our hunters because they don't want to over ... because then they have no\nReal meat for next year if they hunt the her down to nothing and uh and and that's where it is is of course that feeds\nThe or the left wing green ease the this idea that we're over a growing despite the fact that we have in eighty five percent of our\n... arable land is in protection in one way shape or form in our property costs are going through the roof so we can't even afford to live around here so I don't know how they can say we're over developed but they do\nI mean I I just wonder uh gosh how do you solve this have you again on a more a governor Northam that's your your democratic ah he ... he probably believes a welfare programs all the ... seemed to do that\nAnd he thought about bringing in large trucks full of nuts I mean not for a antifa rally but a large truck full of nuts to maybe feed the bears so so they're not wandering around on the highways\nTrue story he just delivered six million taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood and several hospitals are for birth control amongst poor women are sounding remarkable you like the case that broad Kerry bus before the Supreme Court\nAh for you know a albeit now technologically possible to have temporary sterilization or that might be something they could do I don't know what the clinics are for the bears but I'm sure that would probably be the humanitarian way is to provide you know perhaps abortions too the bears if they're over populated\nI gotta tell using is crazy in the commonwealth come out west out here you've got environmental groups who want to do to\nTo bowl like Asian on here because I Can't they can't get that does to reliably take their pill every morning I'm On I'm not kidding they wanted they they wanna guard da da da da da\nAnd and then ... on them so they get my gosh yeah so they can go and get busy and and the problem is is I understand is that they do they actually have a bad effect on this because there is a natural process of Astros that if you let it happen if you don't\nThen I guess it can actually make the does appear to be available all and I'm not kidding about this I don't know they actually make the does appear available all year round instead of just during ones one specific season ... of let's get busy and and then that\nBrings in all the all the males and they've they've had that problem and I think in New York state and a couple of places that you know I'm Sorry to hear that you have more of a nut problem because I I thought all that in flux from Richmond was causing enough I've been a problem with the bill was too\nAnd it's only a week and a half to election day so\nHow's it going to come out I mean what what's the big one going on in the commonwealth right now\nOn the it's a ... a Brad versus out Abigail Spanberger well he ... he ...
