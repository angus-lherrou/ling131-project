I you know and and I get to service the American dream Lars I mean I came from food stamps and I get to run for Congress to me who gets to do this right what other country you know gives you an opportunity like that and then you know it's funny I'm Talking sort of normal\nYou know English ease writes Virginia southern boy let's have a good old time you know and let's go kick some butt and for her it's all about resist Trump G H Trump and anything he does she hates and she's very very clear about it and she might she might have Trump more than any other candidate in the country\nThat is that that's interesting it's interesting that you're up against somebody like that and that Virginia voters my embrace her\nWell I mean we just we had to pull this morning and we knew that there was one of the ninth hole say we're tied and the other ones we've done pretty well\nBut it's been interesting that\nUm there are certain sectors in my district you know Charlottesville and end up closer to northern Virginia I don't know if you know the SARS my district is bigger than New Jersey and parts of Delaware it's Twenty one counties bombs or seven hundred and thirty thousand people spread on this massive district it looks like a dragon writing a scooter I'm the way that it's sort of gerrymandered into\nYou know right now though we're probably about ten points ahead so we're feeling pretty comfortable but it's been a real slog\nNeeds a new candidate NO NAME id but I've had to learn my learning curves been straight up but I got to tell you what right now we're feeling pretty good\nWell I Would imagine you would be you know I Would imagine that the folks and look the commonwealth has become more blue it's not quite blue eyed but it might be purple especially the northern end but it but it's always struck me as a place that was really a freedom loving plays\nUh where were the people there for the most part I Want to you know a different kind of government than most of the the left coach for the ride cos I'm stuck here on the left coast surrounded by liberals but I find that when you ask people about specific issues there often more conservative than you might guess based on who gets elected to Congress\nThink it's who's coming into into the commonwealth you know we are genuine was the first comment but I'll tell you Lars\nSomeone who gets elected to Congress\nI think it shows coming into into the commonwealth you know we\nAre Kenya was the first comment but I'll tell you Lars ... Virginia born and raised right I I mean I was born in the bustling metropolis of analysis right and\nMy dad live down near Charlottesville and then clothes and the county um I've seen a huge change since ... you know I was a kid and yeah I was in the military went around the world but what I'm saying is that it seems that and I know this\nIt sounds like almost there's no common sense coalition left it's almost like there's this progressive and I made up this word ... where people saying that the ... I Can't I have always feared government or even being in it and and supporting the constitution limited government has always been sort of where I'm always err on the side of liberty\nAnd when I see now is is that people seem to just want somebody to take care of them in a sort of scary\nThat that American Dream or that that individual lives on that we all\nThink is part of the fabric of our country the DNA\nOf our constitution it seems that some people now saying that the government is there to help them or protect them and I think the government is usually there just to sort of um enforce equal misery amongst the populace and so I I'm just trying to get this liberty mean back to this liberty same\nBack into this campaign but also back into the commonwealth 'cause this is where I was born and raised I Love this I Love this place Larson meadows I'm an optimist I Can't help it\nAnd I want to see you do well see I'm One of those ... I find there's I it occurred to me the other day I was thinking\nMost of those on the left or more about well let's do things naturally and let's say you know and all that I said look to me natural is not a group of people who are directed by government they're individuals I mean for most of the history of human beings on this planet\nWe've been self directed people and occasionally we organize into towns and villages or or larger communities like states and counties\nBut but we do that to you know to to say we need some things done that can really be best done by a government agency and it's tough for individuals run in jail or a police force or or a military and thanks for your service but\nFor those very same people who want things to be natural but the natural order of things I think is not to have human beings being told this is how you're going to live your life so I'm all about pushing for liberty in Virginia as well\nUh what's your website so people can help you out with

off this hour in Los Angeles Hi Amanda how are you\nThere I'm I'm doing really well on your cell\nAnd better than I deserve what's up\nI'm a great question is ah my parents died would you know that and I and my siblings responsible for that\nYou who who is the student loan debt on and did you sign for it\nAh my mother and my mother I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so she borrowed money to go to school and she signed for it you didn't sign for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you're saying yeah OK\nThat's the case you are not liable for it now when a ... when she dies if she has that that that will be paid by the sale of the items that she owns before airs receive anything so when you die what you own\nIs sold to pay off your debts and if there's anything left that's distributed to the heirs\nAnd the thing so when you die what you own\nIs sold to pay off your dad's and if there's anything left that's distributed to the air's\nOkay\nBut you are not let let's say she dies penniless and she has three hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt the student loan debt people getting\nNothing no one will pay them no one is liable to pay them okay\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar paid for house it would be sold and we would pay off the student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there was a three hundred thousand learned that three hundred thousand dollar house they would you would get nothing they would get paid\nOkay because she's a sell 'em refinanced our parents um I'm trying to get into the tests what houses and I'm On top of the student loan debt\nSo you're you're basically saying she's doing stupid on parade\nYeah my father is um kind of given up trying to a teacher and he he gets kind of keeping their finances are separated from what I understand yeah which my brother is still living at home and\nThey were joining us America this is the day Ramsey I'm Glad you're here Joanna is with us in Los Angeles I Joanne welcome to the day room to show how can I help\nHide anything to taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUm so we're currently on maybe one on we've been on it and come on and I'm David you were in the process of getting a life insurance\nUm it was important too I uh I mean I have spent a summer that his dad took out it ... the I have a full term policy on him when he was younger and he wants to and then finally take that over and make those\nPayments um I don't know what that is the town but we have for Ken I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child and yeah I Would go to this is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to half a million dollar\nOne that should be canceled okay if it's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive ...\nRight yeah yeah and like my main concern is you know we found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own view it as a guy doesn't matter if we had a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah they are out of a ... a ... and like the greyhound on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married a long you been married five years five years they've not address this issue but strength the strength it really I mean they should you should address the issue is that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should\nBe and really the policy ought to just be canceled because I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy on this is a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money so whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned by half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got determine blaze\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad\nOr I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be doing it over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's the ... like I don't want to be paying for something I didn't know any of that because we have only take it it's\nNot only do I need it because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan right not plan has now changed yep 'cause you you made a decision as as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nYep 'cause you need a new mayor decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question regarding out part of my retirement savings say come as a thing called a pension from my company [laughter] and that overall is about eight percent of my\nTotal has had a ...\n... oh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they buy two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be about eight percent of my total assets you know and and the question is whether the gap has a lump\nSum yes or ... ... okay\nHere's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die\n[laughter] okay when you die that money's gone 'cause it's a pinch of yes and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits\nThe money's gone it's gone and if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five\nPercent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nRight\nYes I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nStill it still love you died in you know you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent\n... low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like you're networks didn't exist from a million\nA yeah it's a closer to close that it's probably about four oh well\nYeah total total network to assets house and so forth\nNo ... well ... congratulations how old are you\nI'm sixty three\nWay to go how much of this did you inherit\nI'm probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from my my my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened a\nA a millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nOr holdings patterns or because of the amount you inherited is\nPatterns a\nHolding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... maybe ... percent\nIt's home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means lives they are a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nThe stupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that [laughter]\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid\nThings but then you can minimize those new things along the way in a way of a modest lifestyle live below your means um void\nSo do you think you'll still be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably the probably the higher if they if they minimize those stupid you know maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple the math on networks to your benefit at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there\nIt's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love this millionaire subject to this show in treating\nYou're going to be hearing more from room to solutions on the promise of\nA problem is this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nCommon theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites\nPutting needle work I was a financial advisor then your company is you're talking about your right one K. and stuff are correct yeah not just grab one of the smart buster pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom Saddam to even if she's\nJust so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a little income than have to generate a lot she's only couple of hundred bucks shorter months mhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe that does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this house has really poorly managed\nDon't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it is kind of thing goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in LA but the last year I think it ...\nIf she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building are checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained are checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah than let's cash it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds from the smoke that threat that China would do something good question thank you

important then as soon as important of course\nAnd um when I was going to say we've gone through a bunch of stuff that has included finishing recently at our church were involved in doing some refurbishing I think I mentioned about the windows and so we've got this fellow who is just a\nA real artist a and he's getting ready to retire his last name as Cain wing came but he's a he's a stain glass specialist as he does this with church windows a lot and um and does this refer sing so when you have stained glass\nAnd our church does in many to Gores um there is the possibility\nOf the law and more throwing a rock or\nKnow maybe a kid playing ball outside lots of things that are dangerous to the survival of the stained glass and of course not the same thing like replacing a piece of glass to get into that mosaic right and fix it you know it's like incredible\nAnd with these hours or I think they'd be considered antique at this point yeah right true which is very old pretty old so uh in doing so\nBut these fires are I think they'd be considered antique at this point in ... which is very old pretty old so uh in doing so he is making these covers that ended the windows measure I think five feet high ten feet so they're pretty big right\nAnd so he's making these covers out of tempered glass that will tempered glass that will fit over the entire window and he's got this ventilation\nLeave or we had Plexiglas editor yellow and I love your hair you couldn't even see the stained glass from the outside on them lots of going to do so much better\nOh it and he's doing the you know he's doing what needs to be done to the stained glass to make it you know and all along up yeah there's there is some blazing on there and they'll fix all of that and\nPaint the windows around it\nBut there were a couple of uh of rotten sills the church was built in Eighteen fifty and so uh there were a couple of rotten sills on the window and I was charged with fixing those cells there were just two of them\nBut like I say there five feet wide and\nWhen they built in Eighteen fifty they built the entire church out of bricks and so it's nothing but bricks I'm\nI think about two sixteen inches thick the walls are well right and and then the window things set in their while they're laying the brick and then they laid the brick around the frames\nAnd so these pills or just you know have been there since Eighteen fifty in during the weather and everything like that but two of them out of a bunch of them I don't try to count 'em right now something like that\nThey're actually Cesar ... twenty three windows I Believe something like that but not all of them have the big sales and not all related to break anyway so so you got to dig these guys out and then you know and and then slide and they're still in there and it has to be of a species of wood\nIt's gonna last another hundred and fifty or who would like to think so [laughter]\nAnd go into all this trouble in the end the glass itself\n[noise] I'm In theory will never yellow or anything and I don't know if somebody hits it with something a tempered glass is pretty strong and when it breaks you got to replace the whole thing because it'll just shattered pea sized pieces\nIn any event so in search of the would that would be best use\nUh found a product called Spanish seizure have half or mentioned this before may be that Spanish cedar is an amazing would product I mean it is real would okay first place we're not going with some of the manufacturing things\nBecause the durability factor\nUm you know going with the news of\nPlastics are are composite materials just just not gonna fly okay\nSo I I found a source for a needed for about six pieces of wood\nTo fix the rotten portion of the frame we're able to dig back to the portion that wasn't rotten and then make an attachment cetera ups lay in a little bit of that\nBut in in finding the Spanish cedar I found a source and and local and everything like that and they I you know asked them if they had they suggested so I went by to pick it up and they said well\nWe didn't have for about six is all we had in the length you need is for by fourteen and

host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because today we're going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nBelieve it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because they're\nStress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those of you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional\nIn Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right now as a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy now and the muscles the heart is a giant muscles over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress ... okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night\nAnd how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it\nHas to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith Kelsey um being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system ... the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down\nA great movie absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nRight and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for not kill max is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd I want to let you know the doctor ... has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners\nSo when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for me so if you're feeling the symptoms of stress\nThe lack of sleep the low energy pain in stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress\nYou know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you trying\nOwn health or osteoporosis you want to improve your heart health your digestive health and even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to ... formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information\nAbout why your calcium needs change with age Cal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative book\nAnd forget Chris I'm going to give away after three of my comment formula for the first one hundred color so it's really important for your listeners to pick up the phone and take advantage of that will\nThank you for doing that Dr Pincus I really appreciate it folks this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for every member you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight one for a while if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pick us on the\nPhone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium and how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because of this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby well\nThat's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm you know a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr biggest you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles museum actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take this ... formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back mhm and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference with about a half\nHour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem now what about heart disease\nOr heart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing\nUm we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one\nIt was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw or the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula that count max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nAnd that is amazing and when I use this with professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and and the add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system well so the very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fishing and ... and many of them\nIt's also blocking further absorption\nBusiness and it's really it's really a rat race or who sounds like it's a vicious circle it sure is\nAnd we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula\nThere is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eighty two three

negative effects that every day stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how your kill max\nInformation you should know\nUse your host was when it [noise]\nIt's not so unusual for parents to provide some financial support to their children to help them get started in life\nBut a recent study shows the dollar amount to parental financial support has exploded here to explain is ... CEO and founder of age wave which code developed this study with Merrill Lynch\nCan tell us what's your research showed as to how much support parents are giving their kids annually now\nWell ... we've always known the parents you know support and provide a lot of care and love\nAnd financial backup two children two toddlers I mean that's just considered sort of normal that's just the part of the exercise but\nWhen we saw how much that was calculated to be back in the Nineteen sixties the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen was twenty five thousand dollars today the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen is two hundred and\nThirty thousand dollars which is a lot yeah\nBut the real shocker came\nWhen we went beyond the Eighteen year olds there's been a lot of talk Chris the last few years about boomerang kids and the idea that a twenty five or thirty year old because of the high cost of rental housing and paying down college debts\nAnd you know inability to kind of get launched a lot of those kids are living with their parents and we found that indeed that is true\nThirty one percent of all Americans between the ages of Eighteen and thirty four are living with their parents which is the most common living arrangement among early adult more people do that they live with a spouse roommates or by themselves\nBut what really knocked us out of our seats was we began to calculate beyond that you know having your child sort of in your house and you're providing groceries and maybe letting them watch your Netflix we found out that there were five hundred billion dollars in addition spent by parents on their adult children\nSubsidizing their cell phone bills the rental costs helping to pay down debt\nSending them modifications which turned out to be twice as much as what those very same people were putting into their retirement accounts which was two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year yeah\nI was going to ask about how that compares to the retirement numbers so it seems like a lot of parents may be sacrificing their retirement years to keep their kids going\nTo study launched some of the reflections our pay what what those kids do they even realize that they're taking so much from their parents other people have said\nHey you know what parents seem to like it it's sort of you know the next stage of the helicopter during an hovering wanting your kids to be competitive to live comfortably to be happy\nTo get the best shot at a good life\nBut the concern is is that those very same\nWell intentioned parents and maybe even well intentioned kids could be jeopardizing their own retirement security because if you have on average seven thousand dollars a year or going out to each child\nThroughout their young adult years that's a lot of money and many of those very same people can't even afford their own bills and their own retirement savings building that nest eggs so to take so much of their resources and continue to support their kids is worth of discussion\nWe're talking with Ken ... CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of ...\nGosh it we're talking with Ken ... is CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study\nThat reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids we're talking about millennials kids here I think what age range or the parents who are contributing all this money or these boomers primarily or younger\nIf we're looking at what are called early adults with your Eighteenth thirty four year olds that side of the Census Bureau and sociologist categorize that the parents are going to range anywhere from forty to about Seventy\nSo they're boomers and Gen x ers often in the peak of earning years of their lives so they might be feeling kinda flush but on the other hand we know that about half of those people have almost nothing save for their own retirement so\nIt may be short sighted for so many people and by the way in Ninety two percent crash of parents are providing some ... of the early adult children so it's not just middle income it's not just high net worth it's not people who are modestly resource it's kind of everyone\nThis has become the new normal and we have never before in American history and maybe world history\nSeen a situation like this I Know I was born in Nineteen fifty one I was growing up when you turn Eighteen or twenty or graduated school you're pretty much on your own right and in fact if you ask for money a handout from your parents I was something you were a little bit ashamed of\nAnd you work in a live at home with your parents because I was saying today it's become quite normal and it's hard to know if these parents are powering their kids by helping them out or as they say and ...\nAnd therefore weakening them but this discussion has got to be had this is a new phenomenon these young people are taking a little bit longer to get launched and their parents had generously are trying to help them along the way but they may not be able to really afford it\nCan't why do you see the millennials struggling to launch you know their own lives is it because of student loans or is it the cost of living in the rent cost in major cities is there a single factor there\nI think there's a few forces one of them is that back in the Nineteen sixties the cost of a public college was about five hundred dollars per year for tuition now it's about ten thousand\nCosts for a private college back then was about three thousand dollars a year now it averages thirty five thousand dollars a year we've been worried about the cost of automobiles or gasoline going up but there's been no big outcry over the fact that tuition for colleges has just been skyrocketing\nAnd so for a lot of young people who want to get ahead they have to take out loans by the way more girls take out loans to boys because more young women are graduating college than guys are\nSo that's number one very expensive number to those college loans can be three four hundred dollars a month every month on top of that urban environments housing has become extremely expensive and so here he's got these twenty five and thirty year olds who are straddled often with college debt\nThe other thing that's happening with these young people is it they actually get along really great with their parents back for example an earlier era there might have been one TV set and the few telephone so people kind of how to share if they lived in a home now a young person can live in their mom and dad's home maybe help with the chores\nThey can go in their own room and watch Netflix if that's what they like and they come and go as they please\nSo it's become more accepting unacceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kind of ...\nYou have so it's become more accepting unacceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kind of like to help out that may be just the biggest challenges weaning them off of this idea of continually helping their kids\nAs it is a challenge to have these kids kind of get their umbilical cords cut and got out on their own\nDo you have any advice for parents who might be listening who are thinking hey maybe I Do need to cut back is there an easy way to do that\nI think it's a series of discussion first of all I think if it's a single parent or there's a couple parents\nTo stop and say oh this heard this program let me make sure I understand what's going on here are we doing that oil yeah we are can we afford to and women is the exit strategy going to come into play\nWe talked to young people in focus groups and they said well yeah parents pay your phone bills in your health building your car insurance that's just what parents do\nSo they didn't think that they were being mean by asking for that they start that part of the parent project\nSo to answer your question I think parents need to think seriously and responsibly about\nWhat they can afford that they don't ultimately wind up in trouble financially and having to be a burden on those very same kid the ...\nThat they're trying to be so kind to and there needs to be discussions between the generations on top of\nThat in our study Ninety percent agreed that financial education should be taught at high school a lot of the parents were saying you know we've tried to teach our kids were not even exactly sure how to teach them in this modern age\nAnd social media is having a big impact on them there needs to be some standard basic level of financial education so people can learn about managing debt and the value of compounding and living within your means\nWhich is no longer that certain out there in our life so a combination of taking stock drawing boundaries that just cutting your kids off tonight\nBut developing sort of a game plan so that in one year or in three years and making sure the kids get that and then being sure that they've got the financial education to be able to make wise decisions\nCan die called CEO and founder of age ways age wave developed this study we've been talking about with Merrill Lynch can if people want to learn more is there a Web address you could give us\nAnd metal dot ... dot com and slash parenting and the entire report and also some

um yeah trust me now [laughter]\nIt's\nIt's one of the things you want to make sure you're good come down to like problems like that right just ask tell me about the ones that cover and flying around her sheets are but I I had a um I had a salad earlier in the week every once in a while I eat healthy for lunch\nAnd the dressing you know I'd open it up as a little pouch and I threw it in the trash can and like thirty seconds later it's like\nYou guys come from you guys are like little ... and just it's a little kid and it's like yeah like like a lot of the Woodward I open the door or Letterman and it's like [laughter]\nLike amazing I Need it like do like a discovery on them and really do my research and figure out who they are and where are they coming from an hour they breathing and you know they live in the walls and are they in my head nappy hair\n[laughter] uh but anyway um [noise] where's that going with any [laughter]\nBut it's just it's just a nice transition zero through the ... the weather here is this and the seasons yeah a lot of that that insects stuff is is thankfully wrapping up we're not seeing anywhere near as many mosquitoes and things like that as we were which makes it you know more pleasant to be outside and everything but one thing\nIf you if you haven't done it yet you're really behind the eight ball that you're getting that way very quickly now\nNow that's fertilizing your grass for the fall we talk about do you do in your area to get over seeding and and your your lawn renovation for the fall but says this is also the time of year to be to be fertilizing if you have a fertilized yet um\nTypically we talk about putting down three applications through the fall season I were prime time for the second so if you missed the first one you can you can still get the second or third down\nAnd just increased the rate a little bit to compensate for missing that that first one\nBut I'm One of the things that is really key as I was reading about it earlier in the week you know we talk about that are fertilizing the fall and there's lots of good reasons for doing it but I'm the one that I wasn't quite as familiar with and I don't know maybe some new research I may be just sleep and you know he does but\nIt was talking about a lot of the fall for the the fall and winter rise or type fertilizers\nHave a lot of of potassium in a much more so than normal in her food or that's that the three numbers that are on the bag the potassium is the third one ...\nAnd it has a much higher percentage of potassium is in the fall and winter type fertilizers than the traditional you know normal on food\nAnd the potassium really does\nA phenomenal things for the for the turf this time of year in helping to strengthen it against the the stresses of winter up and to get a good\nStrong sturdy root system establish hoping to go into a Twitter doormen see potassium is one of those elements that\nNitrogen and phosphorus the other two elements in the in the fertilizer it's very easy to see what they do a nitrogen makes it green and on top growth and lots of a leafy vegetative growth\nIt's very easy to see what they do a nitrogen makes it green and on top growth and much of a leafy a vegetative growth\nThe phosphorus helps with rooting in and and the flower production which bar production is critical for turf so you don't and and um\nAs a result you don't see a lot of of um phosphorus in in lawn food except for uh the starter fertilizers that we use or when you're when you're initially put down seat\nBut that ... that potassium is is one that you can't really point to any one\nBiological function within the plant that that controls it's not just one thing potassium impacts everything that goes on within that that plant and this is true of all of your plans\nAre so\nOften times you know potassium as is very important for plant growth\nBut oftentimes we don't see a specific thing tied to it so you kind of I don't think about it that much but uh especially as the turf is getting ready to go into its its fall and winter dormant period\nThat potassium is very very important for the general health\nAnd and vigor of the the turf not just now but as going through the winter and it's it's worth their survival mechanisms and all that\nAnd then also for the green up at the health and the have the um the recovery come spring so make sure that that not only fertilizing now but that you usually know whoa fall and winter formula that has that increased level of potassium to make sure that the plants get what they need\nIn order to be doing everything that they need to do this time of year and and and going forward and into the spring and if you do that you're going to have a much much healthier law not just now but like I say in the spring and it's going to be a much healthier\nMuch more control much more um sustainable green up come spring than than if you didn't fertilize now and we're running around trying to get some fertilizer on it in the spring to help it green up so uh\nDo do don't miss out on that opportunity\nIf you'd like to join our conversation when we come back from the break our telephone number is nine six for one zero seven five we've got to take a quick break you're listening to this no nos garden show on WC H ve we'll be right back\nWhere you found a place where you can find Washington Wizards fashionable on the radio right here where you might just being [noise]\nSunday night at nine fifty this show time as the wizards take on LeBron and the Lakers\nJoined me they Johnson ignored counts or as we bring you and John mall and the Washington Wizards all season long\nRight here in central Virginia on the bill one of those seven five ten twelve sixteen over you see a ... am and FM Charlottesville the dollars\n... and pottery mildew and dog would bore\nA pretty persistent insect problems so there are tough one to keep in good shape but if it isn't good shape benefits as big as you were saying it very well could be worth moving\nI Would say if the homeowner used our landscape planning tool and describe the planting position or ... or a situation rather that they have I Would guess the dog would would come up as a recommended tree because that really is a good spot for a tree like that so\nI don't think this is a tree that's on the wrong location at all um so they would have to just weigh\nThe costs of transplanting versus buying a new one a transplanting a tree of that size you know that's several thousand dollars probably I mean it's a big root ball and some are\nPotentially a small crane you never know how big the ball's gonna be and what it's going away but um our tool the landscape planning tool is designed to put the right tree in the right place 'cause I see so many\nGood trees put it in the wrong location and it just ends up costing the homeowners a lot of money and maintenance uh interferes with the house and just when it's getting to the size words give me benefits and ends up you know outgrowing it's location and you wish you never planted it there and that's where we are trying to avoid but\nThe dog with a beautiful tree and I would say you're a listener that it's absolutely worth getting prices from good landscape companies who know how to transplant trees because it very well could be worse\nA listener that it's absolutely worth getting prices from good landscape companies who know how to transplant trees out because it very well could be worth their their effort sounds like a beautiful tree\nIt one of the things that you know we see this all the time to do exactly what you were alluding to you know trees that are fantastic\nTrees there they're great for for um you know have great landscape value great ornamental value and everything and in in our great additions to the the the value of the home and and the property but they\nAre planted in the absolute wrong spot there either too close to power lines or they're too close to\nA sidewalks in driveways with the wrong kind of root system that ends up causing damage to the the ah paving they're they're too close to the house with the the roots and start getting into the I'm getting too close to the foundation\nThey start ah you know you run risks of um damage from storms and things like that\nSo those are like this is a great tool to help look at the property look at the the different ... you know you're you're\nA site specific elements in the in the landscape and the determine what kind of tree what size tree what hyper root system is going to be the best to put in what spot around the property\nYeah and you know when I started this project it was originally on the tree preservation and but then I realized you know I looked around that there were no services that provided what we do which is a database of trees and then we ask you for the parameters of you're planting location and like you say\nPower lines hard scrapes the house and things like that we want to avoid those problems for homeowners who are planning a landscape renovation are just putting one tree in this fall right\nSo we want to we ask them a series of questions and then they push go basically and we give them a list of appropriate plants for that spot based on their size and their characteristics and the ... zone that there are in\nAnd then in each one of those descriptions we give them a link to Google Images so they can actually see the plant that we are talking about but I'm hoping to avoid exactly what you said and I see it you know I've been doing this Thirty years I Can't tell you how many times I've seen beautiful trees and I'll just say wow that's a horrible spot\n[laughter] tree grape tree too bad you didn't put it out in the sun somewhere with more room to grow that kind of thing so I was amazed at\nThis tool wasn't available I did a whole a patent search and everything nobody's doing it this way so\nWe're really the first to build this kind of digital electronic Web based data base that they can access and it's very affordable for like twenty four dollars for forty eight hours to\nAccess our database where they can do it in monthly um but in any case we have what Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred plants and trees right now we're going to just keep building that database a and getting it up to who knows four thousand five thousand trees and plants that they can access and\nUh decide if they are the rights tree for basketball\nI think it's such an amazing tool I mean one of the problems that we run into almost daily is you know in our designs you know we're you know trying to do appropriate spacing and and you got to the job site and you put the trees and shrubs and in the areas\nUm that you think hey we're we're doing everyone a favor we're not over packing the landscape and we're giving things ... you know room is facing mature and the trees are in space you know\nHey we're we're doing everyone a favor we're not over packing the landscape and we're giving things ... you know room MySpace mature and the trees are in space you know several hundred feet off the house you know big shade trees and then\nA lot of times you get out to these projects and homeowners uh see the way things are laid out in their immediate reaction is oh my gosh we need these trucks closer we need the trees you know closer to the house and you know\nI I Want I don't want to see my neighbor let's I Want them screened immediately instead of having you know eight trees in that silence to sixteen unless you had them you know closer and so from a design standpoint we see that and we see homeowners trying to\nYou know take us in into an unhealthy direction but then we also see it on the other side from a development standpoint I Can't tell you you know we we plant thousands of trees each year and a lot of them are for developers a lot of them are four minutes apologies\nAnd even in the ... municipality side in the development side we see a lot of the same problems and issues that we see on the on the micro homeowner level level oh yeah and so\nIt it's just that it's just a a complete cultural change that needs to happen from development to H always I'm just a sense of responsibility of where we are planting trees\nProjecting what that she's going to look like in the in the next uh thirty to forty years after ... and and I was just blown away when I was on your website tree matrix dot com\nAnd I could see a model and the scale of what was happening not only above ground with ... with that tree has matured but I could see developmentally what was happening below ground with their food system just blew me away is just amazing\nYeah great and from the preservation side the talked about earlier you know as you do a random you know thinking about doing it EDITION on your house\nOr putting in something like a swimming pool or a you know a major heart scape element one of the things that this will do is it also gives you the ability to look and see what the impact of that construction might be on the root system of your existing trees as an ...\nYeah it's all about the survive ability I created this about\nWhile I thought about uh two years ago and\nCame up with these five parameters and the way that I'm a mathematically there's various components of each of the parameters so I came up with basically a little algorithms so you can put your existing structures on your site plan where the you know does that we'll redirect group growth and then\nMap out you're critical root zone overlay your new plan and based on the parameters it'll give you a ...\nPercent likelihood of survival and my experiences that if you don't get to be Seventy percent or above\nThe likelihood of that tree surviving is not good so look further below Seventy it is ... them less likely it is that it's going to survive and that's where I Want to get too which is like yeah we've tried to adjust all these parameters and we still can't get to Seventy well my feeling is don't save it then don't waste your time and money just accept the fact the tree is not going to make it\nBut you can adjust the parameters and increase your likelihood of survival and we're talking here that three to five year period of um\nAh when trees typically die after roof damage from construction if they died right away we ... we wouldn't have this site but\nTypically it takes three or five years so I'm trying to give people an idea of what they can expect based on the impact of the tree and hopefully take a lot of the uncertainty out of tree preservation and that's what this is all about\nKeeping camera we've got to take a quick break\nThe tree and hopefully take a lot of the uncertainty out of tree

he's doing and I think you'll be able to take care of it are there have been also a new developments in the bomber case\nSomebody sent those devices do all those prominent politicians all of them on the left including CNN although we're told the device was not a an operational explosive device but it doesn't matter\nIt's an act of terrorism to send somebody something that looks like a bomb and who's responsible for it well the\nFBI the N. Y. P. D. and all the other agencies you'd expect or going after that right now and in fact I think the president is properly saying\nThat some of the vitriol and the hatred and the divisiveness in this country\nIs being driven by the mainstream media now CNN of course is squawking that well no it's Trump that's why we got a bomb while you didn't get really a bomb but you got to terrorism device there they're going after us because Donald Trump's been talking about is I think that's a loaded hogwash or Bernie Sanders if you prefer\nBut that's the claim they are trying to make in other words everything bad that happens in this country is at least in the view of the mainstream media somehow the fault of Donald J Trump so Chuck Grassley the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee has called for the department of justice to investigate some of Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is\nAbsolutely right on target as far as I'm concerned if you try to ruin someone man or woman\nAnd you make false accusations under oath in testimony to Congress and you have perjured yourself\nYou very richly deserved an investigation and if you broke the law then as far as I'm concerned let's start throwing the book at people who tell lies to the United States Congress another round of bombs reporter around the country I'll tell you who got the latest packages\nViolating peace that all ... from the first time I visited I found the staff to be held for encountering perfect apartment it became available and we got her ... cross country and settled in just ten days we're pleased to their transition in large part\nSurface team that how to settle into the community then our lady as he is now for three months [noise] actually take medication\nMostly it's ... she said I\nLeave the not for profit faith based community funded by the Catholic diocese of Richmond nine seven three eleven fifty by\nJoe Thomas here at the SPCA rummage stores twelve anniversary\n\nWelcome back to the Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Thursday night and on the phone with\nMe right now is Andy McCarthy Andy I Love having you on because of your debt the knowledge as the prosecutor put the blonde shaken prison you know the federal law and I and I we also appreciate the grand jihad how Islam in the lab sabotage America or you can find a way Andy writes a National Review but Andy\nI Want to get your take on on where uh what do you think is driving this\nAnd the life sabotage America or you can find a way to end the rights of National Review but Andy\nI'm going to get your take on on where uh what do you think is driving this bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were devices sent to a total of ten different address who's now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America\n[noise] well I think war is that the abandon with which the media got out in front of what we know about the sensitive which so far is not a whole lot\nUm they were really staggering to me I mean the the trends parrots determination to try to make this about Trump\nAnd even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggests the Trump a sort of it in sided this or that his rhetoric um is so unique\nAnd uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling I'll have a piece coming out on a column coming out on National Review about this tonight but you know just when you when you move out of the world of\nPolitical uh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and get into the real world of like prosecutions in the courtroom and a jury common people's common sense I'm most\nNormal people understand that nobody\nGoes out and commit mass murder attacks on the basis of anything they hear it a political rally no matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorist behavior to suggest that it's driven by\nOr something along those lines it's just foolish ...\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say give all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros\nTo Maxine Waters to the Clinton the Obamas and to CNN I guess it's not a far jumped to say well maybe it is politically oriented whereas if it had just been\nRandom targets are kinda like uh the the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski than you might say well we we don't know what's driving him except that apparently hates technology\nYeah well I I'm not at all hesitant about that last I think that we're now at a\nRipe enough points in what's been learned about the investigation that we can clearly said as a political motivation here\nYeah um but we would be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not\nAnd whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my faith is not that you draw a conclusion that something's politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggest that the president's guilty of incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America was actually a convicted\nPeople or at least one person of incitement in court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult proof in the courtroom as it should be because\nWe have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech um but you know court ruled proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally regardless of how skilled the demagogue\n... or ... or ... you know some other skills speaker at a rally may be and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up and they say yeah I'm I'm really\nOther skills speaker at a rally may be and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up\nAnd they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us and doing to our country nobody leaves from that to say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit mass murder attack well and maybe they'll decide to go raise some doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and it showed up some ... or you know\nA bomb people into a\nInto oblivion oh well\nThere there might even be people who say I went out and punch somebody in the face because I was so far to but a political rally but then when you try to turn around and say handy it's not my fault I didn't actually cause it the person who riled up cause did\nThat CNN buying into a a kind of I'm not responsible for anything gets the guy who was talking to me and saying words to me\nWho inspired me to do that and I look I anti I've covered some cases they uh\nUh what was a wide area and resistance case where a Tom Mets gr inspired people to go out and beat him into depth with baseball bats because he was black uh I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say\nYou had to say I'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color\nAnd and they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that ... that held up on appeal\nBut was CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's fault two days after the New York times published a uh uh uh some assassination pornography in the form of a fictional story about the assassination of Donald Trump\nAnd then there are calling for unity and and closing the the the divisions between is it's it's rank ... ...\nYeah I look I I\nCompletely agree with that they look lost it there's a doctrine of law called fighting words ... uh which is an exception to the first amendment or it's it's over the years been cut back on an awful lot since the Supreme Court\nRecognized as in Nineteen forty two and there's a lot of good constitutional law experts who think that it's a completely moribund a doctrine but what it basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful\nTo you and your presence and you\nYou know turn around and uh and and clocked me\nOf on account of it um you know I\nHave a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I\nInsulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say I'm the doctor and has been cut back on a lot\nIn recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attend a political rally and then you are you know you go away from the rally and you have some distance in terms of time and space\nTo think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act\nAnd we say it's the it's the fault of the person who's rally you went through that simply it it essentially says that you have no agency for your own\nBehavior which is just ridiculous\nAndy I I you know I'm the non lawyer near the lawyer but I've read that case a you know years ago because I I thought this is interesting if you walk into a bar and say something so vile to a man about his girlfriend or his wife that it could be the verbal equivalent of a punch in the in the nose\nAnd you might arguably say for something that bad you might you might get away with punching him back for his words but\nBut I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician but I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats\nBut but I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician but I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder Maxine Waters Hillary Clinton you know and some other allies like Madonna fantasizing about blowing up the White House\nThat if they want to start going out in identifying people who said let's go out and do violence because of this presidency you're going to find a lot more offenders on the left or then you are on the right the right tends to be pretty I don't law abiding I think mostly conservatives are but where do you think there's going to go we got about a minute left in this interview and\nI think they're going to capture the the person a person is behind this pretty quickly was there's an awful lot of forensic evidence that they have and I'm like when I investigated these cases Twenty years ago video is now ubiquitous so I I Would think they'll they'll capture this guy in very short order\nShould be interesting because it's awfully tough to route rap those packages in tape without leaving your fingerprints in your DNA all over it and of course having a courier deliver them\nGay marriage has been imposed on fifty states by the Supreme Court and people are talking about polygamous marriage being being allowed by the courts how about religious liberty we used to think that was fundamental\nNow you've got you've got Christian businesses getting sued into bankruptcy 'cause they won't take part in same sex marriages\nFree political speech the left used to be for that now if what you say make someone feel unsafe the government can step in and arrest you for it and finally how about the idea of academia seeking objective truth\nAnd letting a free range of opinions you know be on campus even if it hurts people's feelings because that's how we find the truth\nNow they're they're silencing free speech on campus and all those things the left walked away from the American consensus and embraced extremists use and now they're screaming at us for being fanatics because we still believe what we did when Ronald Reagan and\nGeorge Bush and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton that Harry Reid all agreed on all these things we didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed to now let me ask you something since you and I are on the same page on just about everything every time I've talked to John I'm Talking to Johns in Iraq from the stream and you've got to read this piece he's written\nUm if we were to draw just as hard as you and I could could we come up with any kind of similar ... list or something like it I Know you I don't believe in the artificial moral equivalency where Lutz liftoff the fall to both sides but\nIf you tried to find that is there anything that the right has walked away from where it was on the same page as the left Thirty years ago\nI Can't think of a single thing honestly\nNow I Know what I'm thinking of single thing we're ... we're we're not calling for America to be a monarchy or a Christian government we're not calling for people to be put in internment camps were not calling for\nRacial supremacy we're not doing any of the crock pot things that they are accusing us of there they were just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacist evil heterosexual heterosexuals patriarchy patriarchal monstrosity\nSo the left to move the goalposts out of the stadium and they're calling us lunatics 'cause we're still in the fifty yard line\nNo do you think that some of those the divisions caused by one side walking away from the consensus points is what's causing all of this turmoil lately violence in the streets bombs sent to a bunch of of liberals a political liberals and we don't know how many more may be on the way those are delivered in the mail do you think\nSome of that is because we're we're putting Americans in ... in a position where the two major political forces in the country ah one has walked away from the table in those dozen or so items and and that leads people wondering well then what am I supposed to do\nA riot when they're no longer consensus\nAlso I mean the the ... another item of consensus is when you lose an election you accept that yeah\nBut but the left didn't accept even that Obama's\nElection two thousand eight was supposed to be a permanent fundamental transformation of the country ... the the election twenty sixteen that was supposed to be a formality like election in East Germany where you just certify with the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary the life was outraged this was supposed to be a permanent irreversible\nRevolution under Obama so they really think that\nThey're under foreign occupation by foreign enemies that's why they have to have a resistance resistance is what you're doing the Nazis occupy your country not win Ohio votes against you\nAnd I noticed that when I was little good you weren't even born John but when Nixon you know said\nOhio votes against you\nWell and I notice that when I was a little kid and you weren't even born John but\nWhen Nixon you know said okay I'll concede the race there were folks who said no no we could fight over this winter we could win this one you know because there was probably cheating on both sides there were certainly treating on the Democratic side he said for the good of the country I'll do that I think that's what the left thought was going to happen in two thousand with Gore and Bush\nAnd they fail and that drove them crazy and lately that that sort of we're going to to rush the barricades and they'll they'll simply open the doors for has happened with Kavanaugh when they said well we're going to throw all this stuff down they'll cave in and Republicans have finally grown the spine\nAnd said no we're not doing the cave in thing anymore and get over it and I think the Democrats realize this is not going to bode well in the years ahead and probably not two weeks from now either\nThat's right that's right it and I hope all your list as they're going to vote in the national impeachment referendum on November ... because that's what it is\nThat is really what it is because we end up with a a Democrat controlled house not even the Senate you know they'll go ahead and tried to impeach Trump even though they don't know that they would get a conviction in the Senate they'll do it just it was just so they could say they're going to they can do it and say you\nGot on a charge Kavanaugh and the whole cabinet and probably Mike Pence they're going to be complete obstruction is our government or the process of government will come to a halt and we'll be some third

Lars Larson Joe pleasure to be with you on a conspiracy theory Thursday night we call a dad because on Thursdays we usually hear at least a conspiracy theory or two\nI gave your mind yesterday I think that this bomber is either a full on not or a Democrat if that's not being ... and uh and I have a feeling that the reason it's being done is to try to draw sympathy to the Democratic party that thought it was going to get a big fast blue wave in the November midterm elections\nAnd I think they're going to be very disappointed in fact most of them are already starting to talk down expectations for November the six\nAnd on the border the secretary of defense James Mattis is expected to send and is sending he says eight hundred to a thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border not remember they go down there and joins some of the forty thousand or so a border patrol officers were already there\nParts of the border are already shut off by barriers of one kind or another\nI have a feeling that if more military help is needed Donald Trump will be selling it yes sending it in a world where bombs and harassment are commonplace oh by the way before I started to this Christian deals in the head of the department of homeland security is just told Fox News that violence against the border\nIt started into this Christian ... and the head of the department of homeland security is just told Fox News that violence against the border agents will not be tolerated now you can translate that any way you want but the way I see it she's sending a message that if the caravan of people's shows up\nAnd they insist on forcing their way into our country the way you can see them on YouTube forcing their way into Guatemala and then out of Guatemala into Mexico if they plan that kind of rush for the border\nI have a feeling they're going to be met\nBy enough force to make sure that they do not come into this country and if you don't like that look at some of the interviews and I've listened to as many as I can get my hands on her my ears on\nAnd what I'm hearing from people is I'm a hard worker I Want to go there and work or it's really a lousy economy in Honduras none of those are legitimate reasons to claim refugee status in the United states of America\nBy the way in a world where bombs and harassment or seemingly becoming commonplace one congressional

seven emails go to talk\nNow Lars Larson dot com and we talk about a ... a lot about Veterans Affairs on this program because we've known as a country for a long time that the VA has not delivered the kind of health care that you might expect I Know that some of ... veterans\nHave had fantastic healthcare from the VA unfortunately we've had too many veterans who literally died while waiting in line metaphorical line that is being put on a wait list somewhere and that's just not not right well I Believe that's being corrected by changing the law and buy a new ... during\nThe secretary Robert Wilkie who's been nice enough to join his before secretary Wilkie welcome back to the program\nWell Becky large thank you for having\nUser new development in the form of an online portal that's actually going to make the veterans' health care veteran can you please tell my audience route that\nYes we'll be launching in the next few weeks of the first phase of a V. A. dot Gov which will be a place for veterans to get information on everything from health care to education benefits you know\nThe last time we talked about the having hundreds of eight hundred numbers hundreds of of links to different websites that that made the process of actually getting in\nTo the system almost unbearable so this is the first of a a two pronged assault\nThat we will be making on that the the second is what is going on right up there in the Pacific northwest in Washington state and later in Alaska where we will be a beta testing the electronic health record\nWhich will for the first time\nAnd in Alaska where we will be a beta testing the electronic health record\nWhich will for the first time that connect a veteran from the time that he enters the military processing center as a young recruit the time he walks into it to be a net will revolutionize the way we provide cover\nWhy don't why do you think it's taken so long to get to that when you would think that the people working within the ... system would have said we wish we had the same kinds of capabilities that you know the average or retail company out there in America right\nWell I think or is it something that you you talked about for years I mean you've made your living on on the preaching free market ideas and appreciate preaching the notion that or if we're going to have official government if that is possible\nIt has to be closest to the people that government serves and a BA has been a typical\nGovernment institution there are hundreds of thousands of good people who joined VA\nBecause they want to serve veterans but they've been held back by uh nineteenth century prophecies and regulations and the beautiful thing about where we are today is that we've got a president who does not care\nAbout what went on in the past I mean he ah I think somebody else was called the great disruptor but he certainly has when it comes to the the system and he's he's not going to tolerate business as\nWell and so secretary well Kerry I'm sure that some people are going to hear this is a great computers that's going to cost a bundle of money but at the end of the day does it have the potential not only to deliver great care which is what we care most about but also potentially to be more efficient and less costly than the current system\nIt it does it does in the sense that it\nWill provide us rapid scheduling it will\nAnd this is the most important part in the president will be announcing reforms in the state of the union in January this will be the basis for the opening of that amateur when it comes to veterans choice and health care and that's the ability of the veteran\nNot to be tied to a system that maybe ... miles and miles away from his home\nIt's going to be a system that in many cases almost all will allow that veteran to choose whether or not it's better for him to get care closer to home than in the VA center I'm that's what's truly revolutionary about what's coming and the beauty of that\nIs that we do have a consensus from the Congress and they've given me\nAs the secretary the authority to create this new system the president does on board and you know it's right in line with with our philosophy of government a government that serves and his and his singularly\nDesigned to serve or those people we are mandated to help\nSecretary well can you tell me that is because I imagine that most of the pushback from any of these kinds of changes like a long vets to access private medical care from the system that serves the rest of us I've had veterans tell me themselves that they had good results by going that way when the ... been willing to pay for it\nBut I Would imagine it also has the potential for some VA employees to lose their jobs have all of a sudden\nYou know all the local hospital the local civilian hospital is doing a lot more of one kind of procedure another and it's not being done at the VA center that means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that\nLocal civilian hospital is doing a lot more of one kind of procedure another and it's not being done at the VA center that means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that have you managed to conquer that part of the problem\nRight well the president has been very clear about um the relationship with with arguments and he has said\nThat there is no prerogative there is no prerogative for unions or any other group federal employees in general um when that prerogative comes in between a veteran and shell\nAnd we have said that clearly the president disapproved of course we are now hung up in the courts but that's to be expected\nOr you know we we're we're blessed with a lot of dedicated work but um we are very clear\nThat a union members who are medical professionals envy hey\nIf they're going to stay the way they have to disclose their time to taking care of patients not spending as as some do actually many\nSome nurses doctors spend a hundred percent of their time doing the work that's not what are the veterans expect that's not what the public expects them that's certainly not with the um the president of the United states demands\nLet me ask you about something this is another issue that came up and is Nathaniel Bedford Forrest I remember that name from both you know junior high school and high school there was about ... of that man who was a Confederate general uh east but he also became the KKK is first figurehead Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd one of your employees a deputy director of Europe VA option small disadvantage business utilization had that portrait up in his office but he said I didn't know that he was connected to the KKK and so they've taken this down\nYou know on one hand I understand why somebody who knows history that well might be offended by on the other hand it just seems like this is where where\nScrubbing every bit of American history and most of our history is filled with people who would not be politically correct by today's standards do we end up scrubbing all of the history and I want to get your take on on on the fact that there was a little controversy about this\nRight well let me tell you how I was arrested now first of all and that plays a this individual or pictures of George Washington and what have you been in his office right\nAs soon as someone complained he took it down so there's there's no complaint with the impact he he removed it\nUm and that's what he did great\nI'm I'll tell you how I'll address this um when I was a for confirmation a there are several\nMembers of Congress who are demanding that Mr Lincoln's words from his second inauguration of grace at bay where he says that we shall take care of those who have borne the battle and his widow an orphan or be taken down from the VA\nReally um I actually have those ... yes I actually have those words\nYeah it took me six seconds on on on Google on Google defined accessory after the facts\nWilling in you pointed out and I remember the fight we're Arizona said if you're not going to enforce the immigration laws we Arizona will under a good governor and the Obama administration fought it tooth and nail and at least in the gorge one and they want under the premise that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws\nAnd you would think that that that would make it very clear about the other thing that occurred to me you're a lawyer as you point out in the column and we pointed out before but isn't there an equal protection issue here I don't suppose the rest of us who are legal Citizens United states\nCould bring a massive ah you know go to a case against the class action case saying we're being denied equal treatment under the law if a certain class of people get one kind of treatment under the law and American citizens get lesser treatment believer and\nActually a really great idea of one of the grounds on which it's illegal to ... to discriminate as place of birth and nationality I'm In this case I mean the assumption was discriminating against people who weren't your fellow citizens no it's just the exact\nOpposite on people who are not our fellow citizens who commit crimes are being ...\nPeople who weren't your fellow citizens no it's just the exact opposite on people who are not our fellow citizens who commit crimes are being treated better by prosecutors are less likely to be charged with charges at all or charged with\nA maximum crime they could be charged with in order to to make sure they stay here we got to keep the criminals here\nWell and and you know that there are at least a couple of places in America they are going to have a vote on this on November the six to get rid of sanctuary status and I think the voters are going to vote to get rid of it but how do we convince\nSay the New York times which things that is terrible that Jeff Sessions would go to one of his deputies and say would you please research there's and then and then the the New York times is an outrage from the deputy comes ... says no I couldn't find anything like that and the law and you find it in six seconds on Google\nIt it's it's pretty amazing but there is an element on the last ah it it's been with us for a long time ago just hate\nAmerica whether they were um you know selling selling or giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union rooting for the Soviet Union over our own country um to today where they are rooting for the caravan to come across they\nJust want to destroy the country now I think most elected Democrats\nUm aren't that hateful\nDriven by a passion to destroy our country but they're certainly bucks up by those people and and the position of most elected Democrats is number one uh the the the masses of third world are\nPouring into our country oh look they vote for the Democrats were all four of them and number two it's just gotten to the point that whatever Trump is for their against it's worth mentioning that not very long ago Harry Reid Dianne Feinstein even Iraq\nObama were against this influx of illegal immigrants bringing their path olive jeez I'm their\nPoverty their medical problems to our country when we have our own people with pat ... poverty and health problems that we need to take care of\nAnd and in fact we've been running a sound bite I mean it's it's amazing that the New York times is forgotten the great ...

I was drinking too much and\nDecided to quit the booze now you'd almost think that that kind of answer would get you more plaudits that it would critics but you know that was one of the October surprise in any case is this the October surprise\nI guess it'll depend on who it ends up is\nResponsible for those bombs if it turns out to be somebody with a Muslim surname I have a feeling that's only going to amp up the president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives then you're going to get the Democrats\nThe president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives then you're going to get the Democrats doing something really odd and really two faced because\nThey will say well if this was a conservative than the blame goes to Trump ... which is a bit akin to saying well if it's a lefty who commits an assassination or commits a terrible crime then the blame falls on all left days\nAnd you understand there is a double standard of the media about that you can cite example after example where the media will say well just because this happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone and they especially do that if you have an act of terrorism carried out by somebody who's a follower of Islam They say you can't blame all of Islam\nFor the actions of one member of Islam but boy if one person with a gun commits a crime than all gun owners are suspect that's the double standard that we routinely see from the left wing media and believe me\nNo matter who they catch and I expect they will catch somebody fairly soon involved with these bombs or devices most some of them were not active bombs at all they were just devices made to look like bombs no matter who it is I think\nThe CNN and MSNBC and the New York times the Washington Post will try to find a way to blame it on President Trump let's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson trout what's on your mind tonight\nLarge in less than ... years love yeah thank you very much Mm\nMm no problem I got I got I got a question is becoming a cross my mind for a while with all the rhetoric cholesterol and out\nInciting violence and one able to check 'em while they're down yet I can go on and on called and they did it ever make you wander it's been making me wonder are they are they is the last Bush in\nFor another civil war I mean they're even all the people from other countries will you remember the\nDemocrats lost the last several wore a\nAnd and the Republicans won and thank goodness for that uh but but are they pushing for another and by the way they'll tell you all those weren't the Democrats have today Oh yes they are and we can you watch a couple of the national Susan movies\nAnd you'll see the evidence and I have to give great credit to punish for being able to do that but do they want another confrontation I think they think that's the only way to remove this president and here's the case I'd make they demanded in September of twenty sixteen\nDonald Trump you have to say that you will accept the results of the election now that demand came from none other than Hillary Clinton\nAnd yet at the same time reporters weren't asking Hillary because they didn't think it was possible Hillary if the election doesn't go your way will you accept the results of the election they never asked the question and why\nBecause nobody nobody in the mainstream media thought it was going to go that way I did I thought it was going to go to Donald Trump and so did a lot of other people and obviously enough Americans voted for him that he won the presidency and they went nuts on the night of November the twenty sixteen\nThey said we can't accept this result and I've always been proud that I live in a country where there's a peaceful transition of power or it has been up till now and we said\nYou have an election and no matter whether you like the results are not you accept the new president\nAnd if a sitting president gets beat after four years you accept the new president and if a president served two terms I think at this point Donald Trump is the odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts and they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have to it\nTo serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts and they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have to impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not\nBut in this in December and January the Democrats vowed we will never even let him take off as we will find a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office and then we got past the inauguration\nAnd they burned a few cars the left did you know all the pink hat wearing ladies\nBurned cars and you know bright it in the streets\nAnd that didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have him investigated for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians were going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections\nAnd I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that could be the last minute October surprise\n... hold it until after the election if you hear stuff starts to leak before the election from a mall or investigation\nThis will prove to the point that a lot of us believe and that is the deep state is at work in America and the deep state has benefited both the left and the right at various times if Mueller's investigation leagues and the parts they leak say he's going to announce after the election that Donald Trump has been involved in some kind of collusion\nLook they've been running a collusion hobby horse for two years more than two years now\nAnd they haven't waited too long well I don't care if it went ten years but the the real test is and how long it when the real test is have they come up with anything they've come up with some tax cheats they've come up with some people who got caught on process crimes\nWealthy people that's not fair we're going to reverse that I'm\nA ... a hold on to reverse that doctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\nYes um so what they're going to have a very difficult time doing that a particularly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't\nI won't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves\nEven if they don't raise taxes uh they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward consumers rather than business the last tax cut the the purpose of it\nWas to increase economic growth and then indeed does that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital he did that by reducing corporate tax rate\nFrom an average of thirty five percent down to Twenty one percent and he or reduce personal income taxes for everybody including the upper class and the upper classes the one that creates new ... D\nCapitals so the first tax cut was geared\nTo economic growth um ... there is a feeling that uh the higher income people and they did made out better than a middle income people so now Trump is pushing another middle class\nTax cut if the Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died if the Republicans don't he's not likely to get that\nAnd I think the uh uh investor community as saying a look all the famous Trump has been doing to stimulate growth which appear to be working I don't have a difficult time keeping that up\nIf the house of representatives flip\nDr ... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation\nBut the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast well water use too fast and can we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing we we didn't have much inflation\nDuring all of the eight years of Obama before making a briefing on to it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive\nAmount of road if the fed would stop crunching the economy\nYou know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that a ... point the twelve month inflation\nYou know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that exact point the twelve month inflation rate for the last couple of months out fire that's better than the two point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we\nPushed interest rates up new home sales the last five months to death existing home sales have death so I'm there doesn't look to be any inflationary pressures\nYet and I think the Federal Reserve is over reacting to this similar to what you just said we can get much higher quote what Ronald Reagan cut taxes in Nineteen eighty one went into effect\nIn Nineteen eighty to prop modeled his tax cut after Reagan right when Reagan tax cut winning in eighty two in Nineteen eighty four the economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half\nPercent so the fact that we're up in the four range and tomorrow the third quarter\nNumber comes out oh probably be the high three we're nowhere near at overheated economy the Federal Reserve I I Believe is over reacting to this they should do a little more slowly with interest rates are true interest rates are still below historical\nNormal but they've gone up so fast that uh we're having a negative impact on interest\nA sensitive sectors like housing and automobile\nSee Dr ... that's the concern I've got is that and I and I'm Wondering let me ask you straight out do you think the fed is reacting only because of the metrics or are they reacting somewhat politically as well to to crush on the economy that is making Donald Trump looked like a chance\nI certainly hope it's ... I Hope they're not trying to\nPush the economy a President Trump appointed\nA Jerome Powell to be a chairman a so he's got his person in there and always been a little critical of them uh\nLately I I'm not sure what the motivation is but they don't need to do this as fast as they're they're doing um are growing at rates were under four percent are now approaching five percent that's going to hurt the the housing market\nDr ...

about just that\nAnd we began our conversation by looking back at last season not even the Stanley Cup playoffs but the regular season as a whole I mentioned it multiple times on this broadcast certainly I felt last year his thirteenth NHL season even before the playoffs was arguably his best season of his career\nYes he put a bigger numbers earlier in his career but given what the camps last the previous offseason given how much they needed Alex Ovechkin at\nTimes last season about his forty nine goal eighty seven point campaign was absolutely terrific and\nBegan by discussing just back if Iraq last season's campaign AS number one on his list\nTo take all my years or so your finger [noise] uh\nOverall it was a good year um you know of course it was just for a few schools every year but it's it's hard to do and\nFor me and ... I ...\nWant to get over a individual awards who was in\nSo many and uh [noise] was and I have a chance to be close to coming up on the\nMyself for playoffs and\nDuring all year to be in the real good shape and the glass and I think are where\nYou know to me it just all the gym was a an unbelievable a shave mentally and hope for\nIn a moment ago you felt Jews you are all better prepared for the post season how do you feel so\nOur house or you know [noise]\nIt felt to if you are all better prepared for the post season how do you feel so\nI don't know how is that um you know I'm\nJust a mentally wise like I was rash enough to do\nWhole different things like ah I guess that long ago for a party in these you know I'm a longer shifts longer shifts yeah I can\nI can be a physician you know I knew I'm going to win that about a hundred percent because I feel so good rights or you know it doesn't matter which and beer thoughts or time or\nA Frisbee games so\nI'll give you a quick example and that it was during the regular season but I remember\nYou would a goal and it was a game against Ottawa late in the first period I think it was you chase on and ... years right at the end of the first period and you went the other way and it was like three was the end of a Ninety second shift and you had a few like that you know three on three goal in Carolina it was like a Ninety second shift or those\nExamples of what you're talking about live so what went into remaining freshly I think that's\nHow I said it's all combined together towards a you know uh we were uh all the time on different things but uh the most important thing for me it's just my condition [noise] how's the weather like stealing has my artist feeling like how can like if I'm\nLike Laura play can I say another a shift\nThem brief so that's a whole or this or a small things but it does is it important for me I mean\nDid that start with training the previous summer and and how similar then with this summer had been to that um\nYeah I think we were at some some new a stop to my uh\nOverall I think during the whole year a stick stick to the system with a new one works for me you know and uh [noise]\nI'm time's up for the game I feel like Jesus like you know uh and I play a game I was tired and I'm not going to play more\nYou know and or something like that or even if it's a ... you know for losing but you feel like it's like I can do much more efficient or in that position you know like a just a mentally stuff you feel fresh as the year starts now again yeah\nThink I'm Still in as a shade tree with share a let's say like we'd have like a month and a half two months to a break and now we have to work again in a you know um because of what\nThose sort of things that you did maybe two summers ago and this past summer that allowed you to remain fresh conditioning wise and and that maybe it or didn't\nI didn't change a lot a hostile stick to the\nSince uh they want to other started working I was in my coach what uh what am I trained her but [noise] um\nHow sick all those little things started working on for me it was for the uh my teammates and the uh there was a\nOne important costs are\nSo as far as the ... how much of a away just to have\nThat off the shoulders and getting past Pittsburgh is just how how different is it this time now as opposed to a year ago even I'm\nYou know it feels much better obviously a film looser uh feel a\nChampionship but it's a it's a different atmosphere you know even in a lot of them\nYou know because we will mail with the fact is we know possibly Haji ...\nMake good stuff from Alex Ovechkin a portion of my conversation with him last\nWeek at the ... capital lights but part of the larger feature for the hockey

post game can salmon standing by outside the caps dressing room\nAnd Ken big picture from a capitals perspective nice response this afternoon they felt there was a lackluster effort on a Thursday night in Edmonton Calgary also was rare to go to the following their blowout Lawson who am I from Thursday to Pittsburgh but the capital's a nice response today and nice to come home with those two points yeah it is you know\nIs following their blow outlaw sun home ice on Thursday to Pittsburgh but the capital's a nice response today and nice to come home with those two points\nYeah it is you know it doesn't matter how you get it but you get it I mean he had some guys are different guys in line up a copy played I played a lot you know uh so they switched up a little bit and things which would be the lions but they find a way and that's a\nYou know a defensive we thought they were a hundred times better than they were last game I mean it's a they didn't give up a whole lot and when they did Phoenix made this topic to her Scott said it's time to stop so\nUh yeah there was a you know a lot of a sloppy play you want to call them a second period but as Morsi the neutral zone and everything so it didn't really hurt them but um yeah it's a when you get two or three here so far you go home for a couple of days and go to Montreal so this could be a real good trip that they could figure out a way to put two points in the board Montreal\nMan you're outside of the capital's dressing room I imagine it's all on a happy Feliz for Phoenix complex as they came off the ice collectively ... thought after allowing two goals and the first spirited seemed as the game went along maybe in the first period he was fighting it a little bit maybe he was getting a little bit more comfortable as the game went along it certainly helped the ad a quite a bit of protection in front of them as you noted\nAs well yeah I agree with you I thought he looked ... second third and then the overtime to and even though it's true though so you know last one in a shootout he didn't do so well but uh he played um so I thought was a solid I mean he did what do you have to do made the stops when you have to make them\nA and you have some help in front of them especially in the late part of the game and the third period I mean they they packed that in pretty good in front of them you know a calorie very dynamic especially that one line just couldn't make it happen so uh you know I thought he was good and these guys were excited for them they couldn't wait for him to get in that room and I heard a big cheer so a good for him\nAnd a couple of the other changes in the line up this afternoon Madison bally's minutes we're limited but\nHe was joining the rush the odd time from the ... came up late in the second period a big block in front of Phoenix complete talked about defending in front of Phoenix Copley Madison bally again in limited minute skated just over I Believe twelve minutes in the game\nBut his first actions since October fourth was nice to see him get back in there and not look out of place today yeah and that's not easy I mean you you can\nPractice all you want facts as hard as you want but it's still not the same and you get out there in the game speed and uh you know a little bit of pressure coming off a bag game and a little bit of heat on the team so I thought he did well he played well or he didn't look at a place for the confidence which is tough to do not playing a lot\nLike you said made that big block their key block on a two on one eighty and humid nice little job there but the\nUh he was good and that's what you need I mean if you want to stick around you have to they don't care if you've been three weeks four weeks five weeks when you're in there you better play good and he's proven that you can and so\n... when a hunch made a couple of changes getting Phoenix completely ... started here Madison valley in there and then the movement\nAmong talked about how best to be talking about a hunch what about Carlson I'll shoot out\nWell you know he didn't come up with the ultimate Clint sure there yeah but just going yeah that's true well look at you you know what that third spot whether it's a match getting her car all thin or Bactrim ... and I don't know beyond that she can in sort of you know I don't know pick one out of a hat at that point no\nWell yeah I mean I think you know you got to go and he's had a great year so far has been put in the pocket and back in there why not maybe they saw something in the ... yesterday an odd way they did do a breakout drill a breakaway drill and the skate yesterday may be the end he I think if I don't know if I recall right he won the skills so that's probably why got rewarded\nInsider information they're nice to see in practice yesterday I write in twenty seven and a half minutes from Carlson this afternoon so again leads the demon ice diamond looked PJ oh she we know he's going to go in the shootout but if you were going to go buy a hunch going by\nMinutes from Carlson this afternoon so again lead the demonized diamond look DJ oh she we know he's going to go in the shootout but if you were going to go buy a hunch going by somebody who played well showed themself well this afternoon not DJ with the power play tally break short handed a breakaway opportunity a couple of more opportunities that even strengthen nice bounce back performance from DJ\nToday yeah I agree I mean I thought he was very good from the droplet park you can tell he was engaged and are probably you know he's a very good you know real professional have been around a long time takes a lot of pride in his game being consistent probably wasn't happy about Edmonton like the rest of the team and he came out and get a nice job\nAnd it's so we'll leave me with this Kent ... uh we we we put the old bowl on the month of October here\nFor capitals five three until after the month with today's victory in the shootout or they have yet to in two consecutive games there was a little bit of an inconsistent moms there was a little unorthodox with the way the schedule worked out those two back to back off the bat a five day lay off at one point\nEarly on this season but your thoughts now is they go into November areas they could potentially build off here in October but at the same time\nMaybe an area to they're still looking to clean up and tidy up\nWell I think you know the the main thing is I mean the fences there for the cat so that's been pretty consistent suffer a couple of games but defensively I think the you know just been gauging the system and I think that's going to get better as the euro goes on\nYeah there's a main mainly the same team back in from last year but a little bit of tweaks here in the Arab by the coaching staff takes a little while they want to be a little more aggressive so it takes a little while to get used to that that's what I think you know when you're looking at November I think the defense wise you look at the goals against I I'm sure that's going to come down\nThree in the capitals within actually a really avoid disaster because Fifteen seconds later of guinea ... was called two minutes for delay of game putting the puck over the glass the capitals actually ended regulation shorthanded and the flames began overtime\nWith a power play chance but again the capitals penalty killed spin a work in progress has been far from fall is the season but certainly a big kill the end of regulation and leading into overtime as\nWell helping the state a three three hockey game and it would remain that way right through all the so we went to the skills competition three rounds of the shootout we are

going to order in order for for the ride over there and get ready for the next one\nAirforce coming up next weekend but today board straight went over and eastern Michigan deem that you'll be by just one point last year you got off to the big start and then it almost fell apart the first couple of minutes and the third quarter or take me through the swing of emotions that you had because not only did it almost\nStart and then it almost fell apart in the first couple of minutes and the third quarter I'd take me through the swing of emotions that you had because not only did it almost collapsed but you came right back which I thought was the more important things\nOne of the first half or defense it's such a great job and they didn't have a first down in the ... were were completely controlling them the ... and the effect of labor getting in a red zone and having to settle for ... you'll go ... a\nVery uncharacteristic of are often but that credit to eastern Michigan they did a really nice job when only got down there close to accept them in the game that\nWe went to bring it out twice to start the second half and a and they score to touch downs and all of a sudden viewpoint ... started thinking holy smokes here we go again just like last year but\nUh I I was really proud of our team how they responded and don't feel like we ever lost momentum on our guys are guys bullied never stop believing and were able to go out back out there and and I get a little bit of a lead and and I had to hang on there at the end but uh fortunately it was good enough\nFor a couple of things stood out to me about this one uh Kelvin Hopkins your quarterback had been bang dumping you've returned today he really look very very smooth throwing the ball and and really had a had a great rapport with his receivers making some big place how much of that week off kind of give them a chance to reset and get healthy for today Mm\nOh I ... he uh he's he's been a little Nick in saying here for a few weeks and he just re aggravated ... weeks ago against San jose state and\nAnd uh I don't know if the rest help we would love to have had 'em in the game last week I think the ... the more he plays the better he gets a ... you didn't really good job today that we don't ask them to do a lot but we have a lot of confidence in the Amazon thrower I think he's the best ...\nRowing quarterback that we've ever had in the sauce and and obviously we don't we don't do it much but I have confidence that he can make every throw that we ask ...\nDefensively this team has been terrific in in part helped by long drives by the ... you had another forty\nFive minutes on the field today or in time of possession of eastern Michigan held the ball for just fourteen minutes an Eighteen seconds but you've had a great season holding teams are way under their season averaging today you held eastern Michigan just three four yards rushing why is this team been so good against the ...\nI think he does a great job putting our guys in place and we got to get stuff for kids ... really a ...\nReally ... uh pride in stopping Iran it's one of those things that has a program we talk about and we feel is important if we're going to be a a championship level seems to be able to run the ball effectively\nAnd stop the run so we really build are nice and around during that first and uh and and then the the nice job today and it helps us win the game for sure to force them to just be one dimensional\nYou know you've recovered eight ... ... opponents so far if I'm correct you haven't fumbled since the opening last do you know how much is that being a part of this culture that you've established in\n... but I think Kurt overs turnover margin as a as a really important stat ... in in a game and and if if we're going to be a winning team we've got to win the turnover battle and I've been really proud of our guys on off that we have a lot of balls that exchange hands whether it's their hand offer a pitcher a fast or whatever it may be the\nRefinance to hang on to it we work really hard at it and whack the ... and uh as far as you get some key turnovers and get a back we got one today James nautical make made a great way and and uh it turned into a score for so those are those are big place and it's just that\nOne today James nautical make made a great play and and uh it turned into a score for so those are those are big place and it's just another one of those things that we\nTalk about like running the ball and stopping around one of the turnover battle is is one of those those factors for us\nYour office has been terrific this year you've you've had multiple games where you've had over forty minutes of possession time the office of line has led the way how much has that been a key cog in in this team's success\nBrent have is off the court is also outlined coach he does a great job coach and those guys he's got he's got the perfect temperament and he's a just a great\nTechnical teacher gets those guys to play with great fundamental pad level and that's a that's a new group besides ... who's our center it has been the last couple years he's a great leader and does a great job in that room and with our teams and team captain\nWe've got four new starters they're well they played some\nAnd they started here and there are the last year or so but we had we had four guys on and off line that really we're we're a I guess that he starters the last season than some of them the last two seasons that that graduated so taboo new off line and you get the production out of them that that we are\nThose kids are doing a great job their top group and and uh and breast and a really good job with a\nGun I Know I mentioned the or the time of position as that has been such a common
