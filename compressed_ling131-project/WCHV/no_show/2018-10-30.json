but going you're dead free you have your emergency fund in place you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess for rental house was the second house but one of you used to live in is that correct\nCorrect and there's the other house rented it's\nHer her brother is living there um he's living there by himself he's paying us or alternately after the mortgage and the uh association fees and the taxes are paid and we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six dollars a month on the house and ...\nAnd her brother well it's not that we're subsidizing him um ultimately\nI Would just rather ... says at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that the hundred and thirty six dollars a month that we're losing\n[noise]\nJoining us America Marisa is one of those in Lafayette, Louisiana how ... how are you [noise]\nHi how are you better than I deserve how can I help them I had a question I Am Seventeen are graduated a year early and I stayed here when my parents made because of a scholarship opportunity\nI Do not know how does it work myself while going the nursing school because nursing school is such a time oriented program\nI\nSaid I Want to go in there I'm Sorry so so you're how old I said anything you told me that I'm sure now acting you stayed there because of a scholarship yes our to nursing school\nYes sir it's ah it's through the state I graduated here and my parents knew because the job opportunity\nSo the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship to to get\nAt twenty thousand ever for years that it wasn't a large life\nTwenty over four years and it's a forty year old program I take it yes they're doing and what does it costs\nIt costs a parking Dolly yearly\nOkay of which you have five kids are so we need eight yes are what you need to eat [laughter] there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with friends we are split a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends or room age yes are okay and so you have rent and electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year and yet they're okay so when we add all about up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred dollars and depending on my dad and ah I work minimum wage and I do things like clean up people our days and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nOkay so let's let's go ahead that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nTheir and minimum wage doesn't do that isn't that sounds like you need a new job\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo energy to get into that you never ... you need a job you need to\nSo you can make more you can make a Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and ... you can make good money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses\nAre walking dogs uh other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage and by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm\nIn um you are gonna be working all the time\nTo work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm ... I'm you are gonna be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you uh\nYou can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go to class and that's all you're going to do what you can make it\nIf you do that the other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you okay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\n... and I married a hospital that actually planning on working at ... they will forget all my life to get out like that in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here so I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships\nYou'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star banking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHigh [laughter]\nI I think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm nursing is just\nThere's always a shortage so you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospitals are set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place was a kind of like you can do that and uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned a very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people\nWalks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um\nYou know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task splits in front of you but you're on your way\nYou're doing really good congratulations ... to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us from Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nWhile I just have a question for you I'm In a way out our portfolio and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all of our house um we do least our cars and um\n[noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation for both of us here the main question that I have is we have the um\n[noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\nUm some off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing or she has four one\nK. I have a four one K. I. she has a pension I'm as well and right now we are\nPaying above and beyond our mortgage I'm On our house by about ten to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified\nCompared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nOnce you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund\nAnd above Fifteen Percent of your income and going into retirement and you're dead free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above that towards the house until the house is paid off ... took your income sounds point one five make sure the total of all the ... and four one K. contribution you're\nDoing is essentially that I'm afraid of them that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of our service not up to that as you get it up for that to throw the balance of the house\nAnd I'm Lynn we suggest you put the mutual funds or categories growth growth in income aggressive growth and international [noise]\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right is going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house that I'm a package for because my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm ... I'm not on campus anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now\nYour back is that okay yeah Oh thanks for dropping by open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia like Claire our you Dave how are you know how can I help\nUm I have a crack in play it so we've been following your babysat for a little less than a year now\nAnd I feel like we are on I had on retirement but we're behind on college savings for our two kids so how old are your kids and they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty sex okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million your head congratulations ... so what's your household income that isn't always\nFeel that way I like yeah we we are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah here Iraq [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo ... what is your household income\nWe are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're right [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college well we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for ... how much how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total\nTotal okay you make two fifty but we're looking to hire you don't have like two hundred I'll leave me one eighty\nOkay and by the way if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's all that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point I mean yes nine so I I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral but I don't think you have to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for\nKids to school today we're going to offset some of that with cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside and put Fifteen Percent of HIV side so we're only talking about thirty thousand are such fifty thousand bucks going into these two things college in return I mean I'm Sorry private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year\nHer kid another twenty grand\nYou can do that a front for from now until they go to school don't have the money I\nMean you just Jack up at five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get with one of those smart vest her prose and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend listed on when you help people that five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nShe put Fifteen Percent into retirement into college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it and instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college\nTo kids that's when it granted that's where I mean you've got is where you are\nSo good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're saying

what's up in your world [noise]\nWell I'm I'm preparing for theft ration and I'm I'm not quite sure what to do with my dad as they said they claim lie a student loan debt\nOkay\nA separate from your husband draw haired yeah sorry about yeah for my husband\nOkay and I'm\nSo you're preparing for separation how long have you\nBeen married for about twenty two years oh my goodness it must be I have\nIt here that we are a lot on the same page anymore I'm and I'm with other things but uh with money as well and that you get to heaven thing I just I don't want to go on let\nMe have you been seeing\nIt's um it's just that kind of thing I just I don't want to go on land have you guys missing a marriage counselor that's I think he's not willing to death have you gone\nYeah please do that for you\nEven if he won't go okay I think it will give you good I'm emotional information\nTwenty two years is a long time and you need to have somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some in maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teaches divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns of marriage into a business transaction\nAnd so it it comes it's a real quickly the emotions are carved often set over to one side\nAnd the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes at that and so er here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nThat they pick out okay\nRight and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything he can to save a twenty two year investment\nUh him with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year and you'd you'd look at your lungs how much they learn that if you got\nA ... I'm Sorry it's sixty thousand oh my lord okay\nWell how would let them know that this is going on hardship to furrow until you get past ah what else whatever else was going on here okay now do you own\nA home yeah what's it worth it to measure it out what's out on it\nA hundred and Seventy thousand okay so no equity their amount to anything\nIs your carpet for yeah corporate for now is your name on that loan yeah OK are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd there is the one that I care she met him I'm Sorry\nYou refused to let him you got it all better than that glass closed that account today just completely closed the credit card if he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car\nHere yet and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years doing those where somebody takes Mexico driven puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down the Jersey row balanced yeah good closing okay it does your checking account have both names on it\nYeah okay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or debt instrument that's open that as both of your names\nBoth names on it yeah\nOkay so your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah okay I Want to accept her mortgage probably as both are names on okay\nSo here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south you can't stay there yeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold\nYou cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce\nThey often do that\nBut just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car your checking account or already separated there's no other day you get your student loan debt I'm it does he have any big savings or investments or to you and\nFor one case I'm not big now how much how I had I had a ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he asked me but I'm thinking it's about five or six thousand not much at all okay not far more than ... witnesses income\nUh it's around Ninety thousand okay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and are going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you got a mess on your hands [laughter] okay no I'm not here so I'm\nUnless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize ... after the separation\nWhich will lead to a divorced one less it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but can you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that put you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially I'm ... and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and we're paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I'll just put them on ... and pay nothing right now\nLet's get the other side all cash but but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to give Bob I'll wake up call maybe the two you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through\nTurning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back in may be\nYou can save this thing I ... that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or a draft and I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but um ... see a counselor for your sake all your pastor say who can I sit down with a can walk me through um\nThe right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he might think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know but those kinds of things are best guided by\nAnd when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know but those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor which really experienced in wise and a godly council will help you in that situation and I sure hope\nYou guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of your ah financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones of AAA eight to five five two to five job and we'll talk about your life and your money interesting data that just came out on the article I read on the air\nAbout marriage\nAnd um [noise] the men who are married and make more on average about Fifteen Percent for the men who aren't married women make twenty five to thirty percent more that are married been married [noise] I don't know why that is exactly\nWhat it's an interesting discussion about this is the day Ramsey [noise]\n\n\nListen up leaders if you want to be a better leader if you want to thrive and not just to survive in today's market I got some great news\nOutside I told them so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal than I Am whether or not you keep this ring\nPersonally I'll tell you that back I mean I've been married thirty five years and they say you know it'd be nice to have a nice ring and you can get you another ring I mean there's stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nOne way and he I mean sweet but dumb\nWho you know right yeah I think so but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and screw it back and a little bit better you know in the two year old aside are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on where they keep the ringer now say and so this ring is not going to make or break your get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nEnd this lack of being on the same page will so you know what let's just talk this through in and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ringing I don't know I I it just represents dumb and so I'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy it\nIf I'm you know because it's just in violation of where were you taught your whole family was heading it's like\nJust kind of you know it's been you guys are just too old to do that kind of stuff so I mean that's a twenty year old stuff rather\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Shay is with us in Fort Worth hey Shea how are you I'm good how are you there better than I deserve what's up\nSo I recently discovered you I got recently it was about three years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up selling out how to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching\nA my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle accident and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser had been advising my mother ever spent ban 'em and the question that I have as he put her in and they knew what he about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars into the annuity um and then the other investment Peter and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there are but the question is the annuity rift recently we hit the five year mark and ah he's advising her to pull the money out and start investing in\nWhich I think is a good idea however the question is is that she\nShould have should have had that the money impacted initially at the beginning of the uh time you know instead of putting putting in a city she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the the drawing the humidity at all you know and he knew that at the beginning of the time\nBut yeah you're right that makes me question other things that are going on that I don't know what they are\nThe the drawn anybody at all you know and he knew that the beginning of the time\nWell yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you I'm but I I I and I am I personally would have but all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent cars are paid off she had the rug that he wrote good\nOkay and how much is in investments total there's three hundred plus\nI'm yeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the embarrassment to the house another fifty to sixty you know really honored their\nOld is she uh she thinks she just turned ... okay\nAnd she's in great out oh she's not like an an old ... year old ... on our way out like right out\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven there you say that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out that I either a anyway [laughter] or at least a ... to my knowledge anyway so\nYeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's it's not it's not like you put her in whole life policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean it just the annuity is is\nYou know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay there okay\nUm but it's not my favorite thing to do\nBut it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her then if it's not right for her now why was it right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if you can ... up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people are people that are advising you on technical matters when they start getting like ... like you have to owe them an explanation instead of vice versa it's time to move on insurance lady gets an attitude it's time to move on to write your state plan or is too smart\nTo sit down and explain something to you then it's time to move on so you know you just you gotta get folk in your corner that have the heart of a teacher so if he if he\nCan walk you through what his thinking was and you get comfortable with it than you stay with him and continue to invest in good roast struck which opens with long track

you're going to be able to go into in line there from there and so you know used to incur right now we're currently saving could be the one and we have a total that\nHer loan and consumer credit card the Seventeen thousand dollars\nOne and we have a total of loans and consumer credit card debt of Seventeen thousand nine hundred dollars of my question is I'm including in that Seventeen I went ahead and ruled in our\nSecond mortgage that we purchased on the home we just moved into a total two thousand one hundred and thirty five dollars go in my mind um from what I've learned in South you know working that's on calling should a role in that second mortgage the reason why I think that is cause that's going to lower um\nOur bills once I pay that off to your your second mortgage it'll two thousand dollars\nYes or so my wife and I just recently got into her second house you know OK so crude ones if you have a two thousand dollar mortgage yes it's part of your debt snowball and baby step to\nOkay good I was just curious I wasn't sure if\nThat would be the best way to continue to attack this to areas that are really two for a week or two daughters yeah if it's if it's under half your annual income on a second mortgage we always suggest you put it in your debt snowball\nMan that's unbelievably small ones so thank you graduation well done and I mean just knock it out and I'm I'm Glad you're attacking this is going to work for you Debbie is with us in Anchorage, Alaska Hi Debbie welcome to the day ramps you show\nUm had a question about whether it would be wise and maybe that's not a good way back to refinance our house to pay off credit card ... I'm not a void of\n[noise]\n\nThank you for joining us American we're glad you hard here open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five books is with us from Pensacola, Florida Hi Brookes welcome to the ...\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help certain thanks for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving up to a San Diego station out there uh we have a date for house here in Pensacola and um\nI Know you normally say not to buy a house if you're in the military um but I've made good money last two times have done it and uh I I'm uncomfortable with having my whole network in a\nIn the stock market basically 'cause we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already in\nBut I Would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there in San Diego so\nYou know I don't want everything in the stock market also don't want everything in one house ... gonna live they're short time and I wanted to know your advice\nUm I don't have a problem with you not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nNo sir ah we have it on the market I I I Am going to cash out of this now this one really they're going to buy health while their cell phones they sold about three fifty\nOkay in a you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up on retirement investments uh you know at two twenty five K now I can afford something out there I watched the rabbit\nOn retirement is that all you've got\nA two point five kittens retirement talking about a half\nMillion dollar house than us or what's your household income or about one eighty okay the reason we tell folks to not buy\nIn the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough to sell it and make a profit and\nAlso sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell show you get your duck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see\nIncredible appreciation and incredible market activity in both of those mortgage you should show so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd incredible market activity in both of those mortgage you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego\nAnd I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um I'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought\nIn San Diego and that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of ... million five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nOr non returned my cash and money from this other home and it goes up to seven hundred and when you sell it you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to the military\nIn San Diego that's about the also I mean Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay by a ... there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we can all agree to that\nSo if you make some money and you're there are three years and you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense\nYes or the so it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non returned my cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something in the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash in non non retirement investing\nA but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years and if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion\nJason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be climbing on their horses when I'm\n... years old but what retirement should I go for\nA while you know how how do I start or retirement and I guess I Do you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money\nFreed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year a bouncer around a lot of average probably right about a thousand elite [noise] okay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay yes ... and how old are you\nAround a lot of average probably right about a thousand elite\nOkay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay yes ... and how old are you not at thirty four [laughter] you know going good do you have any debt ... good for you are you single\nNo say okay does your wife work outside the home yeah yeah she's a nurse what does she made a rat about Seventy okay so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no doubt that there\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done what we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case\nGoing into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has her four oh three or four O. one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match and then you both need to do a Ross\nIRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there and put that in good\nGrowth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else do you do it because you understand it\nAnd you don't buy

dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program their functions like a membership club\nThat yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first student loan payment and it was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nOf the show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole\nSix years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... ... last year it kicked in and about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... minutes yeah what what was the hardest part of this for you all cause six and a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when when\nTwenty two thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just\nSuch a victory feeling for us and I'm so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever to really narrowing down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to\nThink for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know in the world we live and just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying mood nice things and I'm just constantly you know to ourselves that will be later you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of\nWhat you always say but really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just\nYou know go by what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so near free you know just move through the ... last three hundred pounds really does which is a lot of the uh yeah it's pretty incredible ... well I Know it's a long time and a lot of soccer balls are worth it\nIs or is it was we'll go back into\nNo no no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow I'm where I'm baby step for well at the beginning step to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow for an event that say that but\nOn during the world that rooms changes your goal is really good good for you guys like well congratulations to her more sure leaders are more detractors as you went along\nUm we had a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were I'm really you know supported by her family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and paying off dead it was kind of just people who are in this\nBelief that we were able to pay off so much and um and at the same time to one of the big things for us with our journey was um\nBeing smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and things like that but we also wanted to still I'm available lord in use our money for him and so I'm a lot of you know for the first few years a lot of our money was going out\nNot towards our dead and we felt okay with that and so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step to even if it's a huge lump sum because the lord bless us and so many ways when we um I mean we've\nHad both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally was\nWe were outgrowing our car like with the car seats he couldn't even put a seat back all the way he was like sitting out but we're we're getting a very hard and uh so

I'm\n\nThey were joining us America Marisa is with us in Lafayette, Louisiana how ... how are you [noise]\n[noise] Hi how are you better than I deserve how can I help fail I quite than I Am to anything I graduated a year early and I ate here when my parents made because of the scholarship opportunity\nI Do not know how does it work myself while they're on the nursing school because nursing school it's such a tight oriented program\nI\nSaid I Want to go in there I'm Sorry so so you're how old I said anything you're told me that I'm showing now ... and you stayed there because of a scholarship yes our to nursing school\nYes sir it's a it's been eight I graduated here and my parents needed to get the job opportunity\nSo the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship that you get at twenty thousand every four years there wasn't a large one twenty over four years and it's a four year program I take it yet they're going and what does it costs it costs ... nearly all of which you have five\nHe attacked or we need eight yes are what you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where you're living with friends family but I'm living with Frank we bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper you and some friends were roommates\nYes are okay and so you have rent and electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year and yet there\nAnd the electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year you know K. so when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred dollars and you're going on like that and I work minimum wage and I do things like clean and beat on holidays and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books and some stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year as what you need to earn\nThe affair and minimum wage doesn't do that in that that sounds like you need a new job\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole failing fan named brand clothing and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo you don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to so you can make more you can make a Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and ...\nYou can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses a walking dogs uh other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm ... I'm you are gonna be working all the time though\nAnd and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you ah\nYou can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go to class and that's all you're going to do what you can make it if you do that the other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you okay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\n... and I know there is a hospital that actually planning on working at and say they will forgive all my life I did not work for them in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans\nBecause I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old it sounds to me like you're a rock star\nBanking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real high [laughter] I I think you don't mind working in and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable Andrew tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career in terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm nursing is just there's always a shortage so you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that talked about a hospital administrator at the local\nHospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place was a kind of like you can do that and uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work and how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and\nYou know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task lives in front of you but you're on your way\nYou're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help is you're fighting through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today better than I deserve what's up well I just have a question for you I'm On a\nWay out our portfolio and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all of our house um we do lease our cars and um\n[noise] we do that um I have a customer in a in a good client of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation um for both of us here the main question that I have is we have the um\n[noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with 'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing or she has four one K.

I think\nYou get you could change it up knowledge lay book radical ... for the Democrat already over law today before the\nShow though what brings you to come from the floor\nYeah well now I Know I I've been listening and analyzing along with the the last couple of hours on this and one thing started kind of becoming a parent who is listening to the clips especially from Hillary Clinton 'em over and over there were\n... did you talk about uh having a you know bringing in an stability ... civility from a party that the you know goes against what you stand for and I think people have that type of ideology which have\nYou know most of them have the the after the name or up here in Grand canyon the board most of them have been I after\nTheir name on there to operate on your jumper to find there with\nThe other ... there but the\nI think you get you\nKnow with a lot of the way all these are the ones that a lot of things that they ... or you could just replace party with the constitution that when you have a constitution that in your way in the ... the things that you ... ... or you know that you shouldn't have civilian we see that with\nWith the only part that they're getting the the the first amendment was that it helps them out like with the media or\nSecond Amendment or\n... really ... the entire you know what role of government there that are behind bars have given us they just uh in some way to\nTry to hide in in their dislike of it in ... and as we're seeing interest in it they just come straight on out and saying I'm\nAt they don't like you know Jay river or you know I'm looking for the clip here you you know\nAnd um\nThat they don't like it yeah no the chamber of you know I'm looking for the clip here you know your current senator who was running for reelection er here it is a we'll play this clip I Hope the audio works this is a\nActually it is gone now a Tim Kaine was on the news of a few months back a year I forget exactly what was it may have been the Parkland shooting a whiz on on the news saying that\nYou know the second amendment really needs to be controlled by the government we need to regulate you know as we do with so many other things and it always sounds so college all is all would just go to regular\nBut what they ... they miss is as you point out the constitution mandated that this bill of rights was restrictions on the government Congress shall pass no law I shall not be infringed phrases that you see over and over again in the bill of rights\nAre and it was a restriction on government not on anyone else it wasn't a restriction on the citizens and the idea and this worries me to know when James that we're being herded we the conservative minded are good to be herded into a place where we want the government to take over\nThe social media oh we're mad because social media took a lot of these conservative voices and throttle them back or took them off or or deleted their post so damn it we want the government to fix it\nOr ... and we're going to be\nAlmost beaded and switched into agreeing with some of these big government restrictions give me the government to regulate you know they're just so I make sure that mind uh you know it's almost the same mistake the left was making under Obama\nAnd the idea that it's all fun and games when your side is in charge but it's wrong on top of the even more wrong on top of just corrupt\nYeah no I Am absolutely you know ... and\n... ... right there now and the head where you know the\nI'm not only the constitution and we're in the constitution but didn't take it far there were um\nYou know Hamilton and Madison and Jay in the federalist papers really laid it out for this tape came up for ratification of this data to restrict government intrusion into the ... where you live in and and what the Mr Jefferson quote that you\nThat you give up our you know are afraid of you you had earlier\nOh yeah the idea of a government big enough to give your everything is also big enough to take it all away\nYeah absolutely and so I\n... in that that you just want to so many so many thousands of ways of the\nA genius that\nThat our founding fathers had when they\nIn the history of mankind way governments worry that this is we're going to have something different we are going to have something where it's not\nA rule over people\nBut that is it there to keep\nPeople government\nGovernment's only role to keep people\nSafe and to make sure that there's\nLaws and play a you know allow someone else infringe on the\nRight life is just the money was happening I think another and that's where it is I appreciated James you have a great morning sir\nThank you Joe Ferrari bag hitters WC age three times seven twenty nine bishop council men from the national Center for public policy now\nYour Second Amendment rights you do not just to have them but are well trained and I think most of you know especially in Virginia concealed carry\nPermit holders are are exceptionally well trained to volunteer during the services instead of being the deacon a you know it's a ... you say I'm going to stand at the door and just make sure everything is okay during services and that's you're volunteering or for your your powers what about something like that\nWell I think that's a great thing you know I'm you know as you know I'm also a Pennsylvania state constable all the law enforcement officers I Know they go to church always carry their weapons with them for that very reason in case something happened um you know\n... we're law enforcement officers have an obligation active uh crimes being emitted 'em and you know\nUm you know ... we're law enforcement officers have an obligation to ACT UP a crime is being committed I'm\n... and you know\nWhy not protect\n... what some might argue would be the most vulnerable people people who are sitting in church worship and so yes I think that's I think an obligation that law enforcement have when they go to church and again I don't know a lot of law enforcement officer that goes to church doesn't carry their weapon but you know the fact is you know\nChurches are perceived a soft target um\nThere's lots of things that we can do to make the church is not so soft and I think we have an obligation to do it a good shepherd protects us lock 'em ... and that means is all cost\nWell it is it also is is a terrorist and certainly you know this guy wanted to bring terror into a community and and the message you Ava terrorists goes beyond just the act itself because it's a place of faith in a place of God or that's almost like an amplifier for their active heinous terror isn't it\nWell it is it's absolutely a craven acts to go attack people while they're worshipping in sort of least suspecting something like this to occurred um it is absolutely and craven acts um there are lots of people in this world that are pure evil um and you know\nWhat I've been telling people that you know\nAs Christians as people of faith we have an obligation to pray also the godfather the hearts of these people in the evils\nTaken away from them but you know there are ... there is evil in this world I knew a lot of young people don't want to admit it but there are a lot there is pure evil in this world and it's walking around and is hoping to do harm is hoping to do damage and\nWe need to be prepared to deal with it when that shows which were when it rears its head\nWell it's also imperative on us and and I find it interesting right out of the pages of Seoul Lewinsky like our\nOur a a former mayor who declared himself the mayor of the resistance said this yesterday\nI spent appalled from the very beginning at this president's willingness to incite us to divide us\nTo focus on [noise]\nUm [noise] ... and he goes on and and and I could play that clip of where he declared is the capital of the resistance and these are the folks who are here here's the president say my heart breaks for everyone in this is heinous and we need to prosecute this guy to the full extent of the lawn and make it an example that this kind of thing can stand\nYeah he's the one it's dividing us how do they get away with this bishop ...\n... you know it's funny I my my ears are sort of gone deaf to\nA lots of stuff that I've seen in the news lately it's just past say to just blame everything on the president um ... everything will evil that happened blame it on the president is passe so how about we just focus on what the actual and real and legitimate problems are you are and not just used as an opportunity for soundbite um\nYou know yes I realized for a couple of days from election and I think\nThe one woman will hopefully died down and then the next few days but it's getting old\nI don't know whether the constable a council made or the bishop council made sure to answer this question but it isn't it a you know when we when we point to other people and and we blame game or whether it's a the kid in Charleston South Carolina who's daddy grew raised him you know hearing about\nWhy he was poor because blacks got a you know to the front of the line in quotas or or this guy that believe the uh the Jackie Mason send the build a barrier group out on plum island were behind it all and and the the the Jewish community was the reason he didn't have everything he thought he should have\nThought that the the I don't know if it's just completely untethered or is this the ...\nIt was community was the reason he didn't have everything he thought he should have\nThought that the the I don't know if it's just completely untethered or is this the the fruit of our\nAh ... had the ring from humility and humble faithfulness of any kind of I don't care what kind of ... most famous say you know be humble in the face of God\nAnd we have this arrogance of I don't have everything I Want it and it's your fault and and and this is where some of these people when they lose their last good marble or go attack\nUh well we've got lots of people growing up now who are on church um their parents had taken the church and so they don't have that sort of moral foundation that spiritual foundation a scriptural foundation that literally more\nPeople our age and older and you know some of the younger people um but you know a ... more U.S that helped us put things in perspective um you know\nWe've got people living in a world who said well why did all these wonderful things and it's all me well no um how 'bout give thanks to God for that and then when things don't go right um they say you know they start\nPeople start trying and whining about various thing but the fact is life isn't fair ... um I did security I'm a protective detail at a synagogue during the high holy days last year and I was talking to the rabbi who knows that I'm a pastor here in town\nAnd he was saying they had a bitterly divided vote in that church as to whether they want an armed security during the holy days all of the older people wanted security none of the younger people want to security he said the older people one security because they know that sometimes bad things happen and you need to be prepared for them um\nYou know we we raised a younger generation I think that just doesn't have any perspective\nWhen when you you look at you know the\nThe the communities we live in and and especially the\nPoor communities I've coined the phrase recently bishop Ned\n'em and certainly your platforms bigger than mine so I'll just sit quiet if you borrow it that that's fine ... I'm ... I I refer to are are poor communities especially our public housing areas as hospices\nAre because it's like you listen to these left wing or to end poverty is like a chronic disease you're never going to get over it\nSo we're just gonna make you comfortable until you until you pass away ... ended it fails me but I I think you see it and a lot of our poor communities of color regardless of color or that they they're flaming up on this and that's where the gang violence starts to get in and people realized that you know I can\nI can do something even if it's joining some heinous gang or I might wind up floating in a river one day or at least I'll uh I'll make a lot of money before they kill me\nWhile that it that that's very deep I hadn't thought about that but you're absolutely ... absolutely right um you know we push 'em off into the corner they sit there and then hopefully at some point they'll go away um\nAnd you know I don't know if you've ever heard the term heard rich but yeah so you know maybe somebody gets involved in the alternative economy and starts to make a little bit of money but they're still living in the same little corner of now I um yeah I Know it's horrible\nI never heard that phrase but yeah it it just it bugs me to listen to these folks talk about poverty as if it's some sort of ... disease\nAnd maybe that's where the panic comes from the special counsel and that is that uh you know that the left is finally caught out there and that our economy is growing at four percent GDP\nHigh and more people are making their way or on their own without government and and these folks are saying hold it maybe we've been caught in a lie and they don't want to be caught in it they're they're hoping to win this mid term so that against all that\n... well I mean you know that's not going to be\nCaught in a lie and they don't want to be caught in it they're they're hoping to win this mid term so that they can solve that\n... well I mean you know that's not going to be a panacea to everybody's problems or less I going to make everything go away instantly um we're still going to be back here and the day after the election we're still gonna have to deal with one another on the question is how are we going to do it um you know we still have lots of an church people running around saying heinous and doing heinous things um\nAnd we have two people people reporting to be a face doing the exact same thing um you know we need to start dealing with one another I'm ... and inappropriate and godly way um and then\nAgain I just preach about it on Sunday but you know also for getting us we need to have some forgiveness and our hearts or things will not get better\nI our local news may I just had a story from here in central Virginia where a woman a shot a guy who was trying to break into her house or after coming halfway around the world to ah after becoming friends with her daughter on line\nUm and showed up at at their house or

Trump for being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda ally in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also\nDirect primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum ...\nAnd I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress and the Senate as we move forward and\nOr a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting Monday the state so that they can become you know the fifty outlets of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because there are political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets\nX number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors or it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we\nWe often go to the case of health care savings accounts and that it would be up your own account you manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money but when you get older if you really get sick that money that account is built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what your deductible is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic hair fairly inexpensive depending on what your doctor bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack a cancer or have a bad accident [noise]\nBut anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas\nEmpty Wichita, Kansas he joined us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us Dr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita\nI could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month I get unlimited care twenty four seven I get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get\nUnlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat's very uh every American could have ... level direct care just like you and how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting there is\n... and we don't want those people managing our healthcare every American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model cars manager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays re procedures\nWe can fix is we can work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease Amy yeah their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in unfair\nAllowing the free market to function in because if we go back towards a and Affordable Care act's dial a Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know inundate in a way that is meaningful for patient\nAnd more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled\nSocialized medicine where you're going to inserts a government between patients and their doctors or you know I think of the capital here you know that's how the ... that's the same government that's going to control your health care or you have another position that his health care freedom and these are the freedom of choice between you and your physician a word that your decisions are not being made by the go\nBy and by the government and so you know I'll direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been graced by most Republicans that are running including a disadvantage who's running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race that is Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know to direct primary care and his platform\nUs so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom and this is definitely the vision for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors\nAnd because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I could pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but um I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care and get a doctor's recommendation Mm\nAnd then and you know what if every American wide wide only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock in the box places and I'm not\nNow playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities but I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom\nAnd we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we've we've been you're missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care so this really is a crucial step in his\nWe've we've been you're missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and met our ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we what choice do direct care model allows ... every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not\nTo get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nI'm Shauna in ours is should it be a person\nI ... you know in our practice we have not raised our prices in eight years we've turned sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so their preexisting no pre existing condition the question is can you actually afford to get the care you need by the doctor you need when you need a and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship can actually do\nThat so you need to embrace you know the people that are running for office that support the freedom and health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with Republicans 'cause they promise to repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're going to have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare when you're offering a health care cooperative model\nYou've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get launched but there's over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty ... started last month for a while and that's a new practice every business\nOr the ... and then you have any direct access to every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor\nThere are no pre existing condition prejudice at all these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care there is no insurance except you probably would have won a couple a direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive ... the owner\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know a point that goes unmentioned is the fact that these insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent of review and Dr Lee and I never raised her prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nGood money trying to be noisy but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm a I'm a make a monthly you making any money\n[laughter] so what do you want me to has been acquired yeah yeah\nI mean this has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices of flow or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting and it's worked ...\nSame poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out what is the pack and pay above the Z pack\n... nation should be able to get that if you think about it the poor and sick reward the more you need a model like this\nMIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system and only twenty cents on the dollar got to the recipient going to lead you to have a a functioning car and car insurance and gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email that you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because\nDoctors are and how many patients you have a we have about six to seven hundred protests\nYou know that you can call them you don't have to leave the house\nNecessarily because the doctors are and how many patients you have a we have about six or seven hundred per doctor okay I'm a liberal Democrat either way and I was just\nLike most practice is probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know say let's go fishing together hum this most people drink but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our ... and our lives last year we had her height we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stops as we factor that it I'm On the part\nOf the ... we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so you know with or a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model our looking increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone\nOr the interest is massive will keep sign growing it as long as we put policies were placed the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to\nGrow and blossom or you'll see this moving moving all across the country are getting better access

and the Internet news\nSites that I scan every day they usually have this morning it happened about quarter to five in the morning so I'm looking at these things and the first thing that pops up which had only been posted I think Fifteen or twenty minutes before because\nI'm On the left coast of America so it's a little bit later back in the east is Donald Trump's tweet announcing something that I

between World War one in the late teens teens are in Nineteen sixty five there was very little immigration to America at all [noise]\nAnd this really wasn't a major issue but today it's a norm is

grow up and you know\nInterestingly enough lawyers it was a place where I first saw a sign that as a as fired me\nLately to focus on a related topic but it it was a sign that said save Soviet Jews and I've been thinking about it you know this is obviously not only an expression of you know what people are safe\nDo it their best which just care about others but it was a reminder now that a community that your story about Jews and the Soviet Union now has to like Jews in Europe or even to worry about their safety in our own country and this is a very very\nBad side of what has been happening in terms of ah the rising\nNot only anti Semitism but uh anti Israel sentiments a and and more generally I I think I have a hatred for people who are art of a\nWell frankly are primarily art of the left or archery as the premises so or often allied with the left and that's a that's a very worrying as I say statement about what's happening in our country more broadly\nYeah because you warned us for a long time that uh with the rise of sharia law in in various places in the middle east with a hint of it at least in in part to Western Europe like France and even in England that we worry here about folks you know handing out offensive\nLeaflets or or uh you know they they'll go in and they'll they'll vandalized the synagogue um but we don't is often hear about people literally committing murder all those Seattle had a murder there was aimed at a Jewish citizens are not too many years ago\nAnd I guess I just wonder are people aware that that that is going to seem small by comparison ... takes

environment that's dangerous they're much as we're seeing in other parts of the world it's a it's it's dangerous for both Jews and Christians and as I said\nThat sign outside the synagogue a tree of life that squirrel hill minute Pittsburgh inspired an effort that I've been involved in a coal to save the persecuted Christian Coalition and we're looking at\nIn addition to what Jews are experiencing a two hundred and Fifteen million Christians around the world are being heavily persecuted I don't mean they're just having a hard time getting a job or you know people are unpleasant to the I talking about people are being tortured or rape\nOr a driven from their homes or a crucified or or murder\nOn mass and that is\nPart and parcel of what's going on it's not just let me be clear

through\nVarious parts of the western world just as an example are like I just want another skirting around this just this past week a good friend of mine a woman by the name of Elizabeth ... of Austria or was founded by the European Court\nOf human rights to have trans grass by\nSpeaking about the prophet Muhammad exercising her freedom of speech which he has the right to do with not\nConstitutionally guaranteed is here but even in Europe you have a right under their you know human rights convention to speak but\nApparently according to the court not if you offend others religious feelings as they put it well that's a real blast with me and that is the leading edge of the effort to force a you know a civilization to submit to this trivia\nDoctrine and program very ...\nIt is very and let me throw another idea that you and this one's one I just just occurred to me as you were speaking about that Frank\nYou remember how we worried over the last couple of years did the Soviet Union tried to use Facebook and other social media it's aren't not sort of you and your Russia or did they use it to try to change the outcome of an election and we also in while their their efforts were kind of ... uh but you know we don't want people doing that anyway or having a\nForeign power trying to interfere with their elections\nI heard the discussion the other night that was talking about the\nFact that an awful lot of these anti somebody's like Robert Bowers or you know the guy who said do all the Jews must dies use being taken into custody a synagogue on Saturday they've been pushed off can most conventional social media because social media sites like Twitter and Facebook say we don't want you on your so they've gone to other alternative\nOnes that are more you know wild wild west when it comes to you can say anything you want\nAnd they said that's you know in some ways that's good because it gets them away from the conventional sites where most of the people are focusing their social media but his band in the sense that they almost disappeared from public view until they pop up\nBut are you from the conventional sides were most of the people are focusing their social media but his bad in the sense that they almost disappeared from public view until they pop up doing something like what Robert Bowers is accused of doing\nAnd it occurred to me if you were in the middle east and you are a ... law you know a a proponent for at here and and you said how can we screw things up in America and how can we advance our cause because they clearly hate Israel and hate the Jewish people\nOne of the ways they might do it and they could do it from a distance would be to get on social media and encourage the Robert ... hours of the world couldn't they\nBut does anybody even looking for that phenomena [noise]\nI I think people are are perhaps not enough and or maybe not aggressively enough but uh uh uh let me just add something to to round out what you've said you hours because it seems to me that\nIt's at least as problematic that a while the social media platforms that Google's Facebook's the twitters and so on are are\nMigrating Robert power's off of their pages on the grounds that they're saying violent or hateful things they're also using the Southern Poverty Law Center\nWhich is a political warfare instrument of a left to try to keep people like well lady for example you up\nFor losing their platforms and speaking truthfully it's actually about the dangers that we're facing from some of the left or\nBut it's never acted to extend citizenship this far and so\nA really this could be corrected\nToday tomorrow it doesn't need an amendment to the constitution as many people who objected to the rumors about what President Trump is planning to do it doesn't actually required amendments of the constitution the changes is it's really been a mistake and application of\nThe fourteenth amendment by the other branches that has given us this problem\nWell if there's no statutory law to speak up on those and there is the amendment and all it takes is the bureaucracy to behave differently as you said the passport office or any other government agency that takes into account\nWhere you are what what country you're a citizen of primarily the state department than it is within the president's power to say stop issuing passports or any other documents to people who are not citizens by birth right Ken and then the economy\nOh I understand it you know to actually what ...\nWhat we have is we have a a statute eight USC fourteen or want it simply would teach the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying subject to the jurisdiction thereof and it's been executive application or you could say miss application of this language that's given us the current problem with the president\nWanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct it of course what we've seen during the Trump Administration is that\nA federal judge it as a hostile to the president have sworn in his attempts to exercise is a legitimate authority in connection with in rats and eat grass of foreign people\nSo I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this if the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nWell in in in this case that law was written I think in fifty two and the other one we spent a lot of time with I think it was the McCarron act was written in fifty five\nDo you think that the legislative history is it the members of Congress in Nineteen fifty to all the way back to what are we talking about our eyes and our other Taylor tail and you know I think it would be Eisenhower at that point where it was a true fifty\nFifty twos Truman yeah of course we have there's a general rule in in the law that where you have\nA language that's been used before being repeated it should be understood as having the same meaning so what that would mean as if if the Congress uses language directly from the fourteenth amendment we should understand the language of the Congress has used as having the same meaning as it hadn't the fourteenth amendment which gets back to what I was saying before about\nWhat the chief author and another one of the most prominent are proponents in Congress\nSaid this this phrase olive tree subject to the jurisdiction there of men and again what they said it meant was that the person in question didn't ... oh any allegiance to any foreign stage so that would not cover uh foreigners and would not cover anchor babies that would not cover birth terrorists that would not cover any of these people\nAnd in fact you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application because he's at today's practical application if uh if uh\nIf you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application\nBecause gives it today's practical application if a if a South Korean mom\nFlies into Los Angeles or Seattle stays for a few weeks delivers a baby and goes home she likely goes home with a birth certificate from the state of California which is a sanctuary state so does that become definitive\nOf what and who that child is or is it the U.S government's policy at the time they were born the definitive because they go home to South Korea with mom and the kid turns Eighteen and then says okay mom\nI'm headed back to America since I'm a citizen\nDoesn't matter what what we said today or does it matter what the policy is Twenty years from now or Eighteen years from now when the kid comes back to America hoping to establish himself and then at some point bring six or eight of his family members with him\nWell this is the kind of question that in a law professor wouldn't be able to find that I'm not trying to to try to answer of course the\n... the legal answer I think is that that doesn't matter but the practical answer is well I'm the president Eighteen years from now could order that he'd be given a passport so on the other hand of course\nYou think Hillary ... running Eighteen years from now she's running right now I think so why not\nWell ahead of the way I don't know that I Want to get up into those weeds\nAnd I need to narrow the Hillary Clinton says she's still available for the ... for the residency of anybody wants her\nAnd I really liked to be president that'll\nBe loosened a doctor good when I appreciate this listen\nI was so happy this morning when I woke up and I saw that tweet and I thought I'd been asking for this on the radio for Twenty one years please take a look at the fourteenth amendment and I always said I talked to a

that he's going to change the interpretation of the federal government reading the fourteenth amendment that catch anybody off guard\nNot caught off guard at all listen to the president has been trying to fix the problem of immigration a century became president of the United states you'll remember to October's or do we put forth a a Seventy point plan and how to fix immigration Democrats wouldn't come to the table he then Joel to down to four main pillars are the Democrats\nCentral to down to four main pillars are the Democrats ...\n... and any reasonable rational\nOr sane way and so the president said look I've got to look at my powers under the constitution the full power\nI can I can execute from the executive branch that is legal\nTo try and solve the problems that we face that are decades old the Democrats will come to the table we have a crisis at our border that's been there for a while and now we have thousands of migrants coming here who's stated goal is to break our laws in the coming to this country it's unacceptable and the president won't stand for it anymore\nNow Hogan I Know that all the details of those have not been written yet but since you and I and the president are all on the same page on this thing I told you I've I've asked for Twenty one years for a different interpretation of the fourteenth amendment\nBut let me step through some of the counter arguments there are people who are going to say not me I don't agree with those but I Want to I Want people to hear your answer the president is trying to change the constitution with\nThis executive order is that it is that act\nNo absolutely not I mean there's plenty of people on the side of you are Lars Larson who believe that that interpretation was faulty from the get go the Supreme Court has never ruled on this topic at all uh in in its entirety and its current form listen there are only two developed countries worldwide who have\nUnrestricted birthright citizenship and that's the United states and Canada many countries have gotten rid of it including a France and Ireland and there's no country in Europe or East Asia with similar similar a birthright citizen ship policy

great books and most recently death of a nation which is on DVD now but one of the other things we've talked about before dinner a long time ago is that you're an immigrant\nTo this country illegal immigrants to the United states of America now an American citizen who's worked for president or a president and you've done some great things I Want to know your thought on the president saying we have\nIn misinterpreted the fourteenth amendment to the constitution for a hundred years and he wants to straighten it out and I think he's picked the right ... mechanism that will eventually bring it to a court case what's your take\n[noise] well I think is that he is um uh he is\nPicking up a topic where people have taken something to be off the air that is in no way of\nUh the language of the constitution particularly on what are the most of the quote natural born um which can be interpreted uh uh you know a bunch of different ways including the fact that you hear often a match for all of the most divisive area and now I don't need to be sort of\n... about it but I think Trump is\nIt makes a point when he says listen the pound it probably did not intend some illegal person can cross the border deliver a kid and boom is that he or she is a U.S citizen a life that was probably about what they had in mind and so yeah I don't I think it's a really good it's\nBoom he's they get that he or she is a U.S citizen for life that was probably about what they had in mind and so yeah I don't I think it's a really good issue for him to test before the Supreme Court\nAnd over the years it didn't actually I've been on this hobby horse for about Twenty one years and all admitted it's been a something that has bothered me I started talking about it on the radio about Twenty one years are going to say\nThe fourteenth amendment or I read all the history of read the various legal pieces about it I'm not a lawyer but I said this this is the wrong way to interpret it illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states they've entered the country illegally\nShould we automatically grant that we've created moral hazard like birth birth place of birth writes a tourism where people literally fly into the country\nHave a baby and then fly home saying there's our little retirement plan right they're all wrapped up in ... glows and you say well this has to get fixed and every lawyer I talked to said well there's not really a good legal mechanism to bring a case\nOr challenge it in court but now the president is found his own unique way to say if I pass if I sign this executive order\nYou can almost guarantee that by the end of the week there's going to be a court challenge and then we'll actually see what the Supreme Court says about\n[noise] exactly and it's only\nBeen in some lined up in court as a little different than it's been in the past any part of what the left does in these situations is that they use a kind of struggle to shoulder as I say that because of the pose the helplessness a to create a situation which politically benefit them um but\nUh that's why I think Trump is showing a certain kind of bold nests on all fronts or even Reagan didn't show in the eighties or so for me it's always a fascinating exercise to move back and forward in time because as you know I became a conservative as maybe you live in the Reagan Era\nAnd ... or ... or ... is that both sides have\nI have to admit that didn't actually for the longest time I was kind of a political not that I wasn't interested in it but it was a reporter I kept my opinions out of my story is not had personal opinions that I Would say but I was always careful to keep them out so for a lot of people they\nThey looked at me on TALK radio a long time ago and so you're a conservative or you're not a liberal you worked in television I said yeah I had my own opinions but I kept him out of my work 'cause that was my job at the time\nI'm ... I Want you to describe depths of the nation your most recent documentary that's now out on DVD and why people should go out and get it now that it's available in that form Mm Mm\nMm well because we talk a lot about fake news but we don't talk enough about scholarships and fake history and steak narrative in the last makes accusations against Trump and the conservative or example they say there's a fashion the Republican Party is the party of fascism\nBehind that is a kind of a narrative a big story and the story is that fascism is on the right back at them as as a right wing Saddam and it's actually something like that are likely in front of and this whole argument would collapse\nAnd the notion fascism is likely phenomenon has been something that left an\nOld since the Nineteen forties they've got it into the textbooks that got it on the History Channel they've got it in the wake of media and so a lot of people you know and to be true even though it's not true of fascism was never seen on the right prior to that\nBut what we're seeing is aggressive his story obviously that it's\nA kind of ... and all of us are sort of have to have an ...\nI watched the movie is try to do that the nation is Rick you out of that law show you a history as it was actually very and by the people who live through it in the twenties and thirties attained a fresh look at our own American story though when you see it in the new like you'll never be the quite the same uh get\nIn fact I think that's true of all the documentaries you've done and I cite the ...\nStory though when you see it in the new like you'll never be the quite the same uh get\nNo in fact I think that's true of all the documentaries you've done and I cite them frequently in conversations with people and say go watch this documentary and understand the real relationship historic relationship between say the United states and Mexico where our current relationship\nIs a little bit strained but some of that may go back in history but some of it was settled a long time ago in the United states\nI think acted very honorably in his relations toward a much less powerful a state of Mexico back in the day and and and we subtly you're your own country great uh but but then you have to be responsible for your people ... ...\n... Ah yes absolutely so that Louisiana new typically a book that goes with the movie um the ... is an emotional narrative\nIs it hard for them firing the book is that although references and flipped out so it's kind of my way of putting out a one two punch and the left has not been able to focus single whole into this they liked the screen\nIn general and misrepresent what I Would imagine that it was a liberal Democrat nonsense I'm not saying that it's not even remotely what I'm saying but what I Am saying is that if you're looking for the vestiges of fascist\nTactics in America today you'd be far more likely to find them on the left and on the right\nOne in fact aren't most I mean many of the policies that are being pushed by the most radical elements of the Democratic party including or cause you a court chosen Gillum and others is lunchtime nationalized healthcare let's do this you know and it's a lot of policies that they weren't the let's take over the world policies of the Hitler regime but they certainly are socialist policies\nAnd I always like to remind them ... Nazi actually stands for\n... ... yeah I mean when the part of the problem and I think back to fascism and not is and we think of World War two and gas\nChambers and and while those it come out of the war with no fascism was not was not portrayed like that that's not has a fascist became the largest political party both in Germany and that and and and earlier in Italy or they became the largest party by hand painting on government takeover of the bank\nAnd health care government control of education essentially government control not only of the organs of the economy but also over the life of\nCitizens that would be molded in a kind of a single unit I'm like sitting in the box if you will with leftist ideology that's what they're not the east coast like from town meeting and in a sense coordination and that's what the left and trying to do in their own way in America today eat at all in this mission intimidate us all into\nThat need to stay in tune in a sense\nLying our own swastika

how you're moving all night\nWe launched an hour ATV um you know before the president burst onto the scene but that was under the same model that we we were not getting our message out at the at our age mainstream media channels certainly not in a spare cash and so we said you know ... that work\nAnd and so we did the same thing the people are fed up with hearing lives with hearing propaganda\nWith with hearing hatred\nSimply because somebody disagrees with them and you talked earlier about the violent rhetoric I've not heard one Republican Lars if you that does not denounced violence to stop that now it's a rioting has not announced breaking the law yet it is only Democrats\nThat either enable them to do this ... to do that you hear so many layers say well we need to give them room to riot you're not going to hear a Republican or conservative say that you know and it's only the Democrats that pushed that\nI'm Talking to ... who's a host for enter a TV you might remember him as the guy who smashed the TV that was showing liberal news and I'm sure grants that will be brought back up when they decide to tar and feather you for your violent actions\n... the TV

and of course at the same time\nNot acknowledge that they've done things like you know showing image of Paul Ryan allegedly throwing somebody off of a ... off a cliff in a wheelchair you know because that was that was an okay message but smashing an inanimate object that's pure evil\nIt you know I Want to tell you it was one of the most fun shoots I've ever been on and I've been in t._v. for a long time my background as mainstream media was an investigative reporter before I ran for Congress and that got in a talk radio and working at enter ATV and that was the most but I had so what we did for people that I hadn't seen it as we played clips of\nAll the deceitful media saying horrible things about the n._r._a. and the\nPresident and conservatives our racist\n... ads and all these things and it pulls out with me wearing a T shirt that says socialist chairs and I have a sledgehammer and I smashed the TV and I had to look really mean right while doing it but it was the hardest thing because\nWe're laughing middle of this thing at the GPS going fly at all we did is what the left doesn't do we smashed our own property we pay for all property we didn't do it to anybody else property and you know what the brilliant part of that video was\nLaws I didn't say a word and we did not have a gun and they still\nWent ballistic over at no guns do speech nothing and of course they said we were being violent were not being violent we were just acting out what everybody wants to do they want to smash their TV when they're tired of being hammered over the head with nonsense every\nNight I'm Talking to ... uh hosted in or a TV you know one thing that bothers me grant the fake\nNews doesn't all have to come in statements of of of ... true facts it can also come by omission and you know when I heard about the shooting at the synagogue on Saturday I was following Twitter and I thought oh my God this is horrible I said a prayer for those people\nBut I also thought about my friend John ... who runs a crime prevention Research Center who points out that Ninety eight percent of all the mass shootings in American I'm tired of hearing about them to I Want them to stop\nBut they happened in gun free zones now I I didn't do a full catalogue of what network news did but I'm willing to bet that not a single one mentioned these mass shootings happen in places that are disarmed\nAnd then make the very simple point cheap I mean if a reporter at a network I ever had the inclination say\nHow do we protect the important stuff and he ... he or she just\nWent through his day and said well I went to a ball game at the stadium the other day and there were armed cops or guards there and went to a shopping mall armed guards the building I mean right now armed guards most banks aren't you know go right down the list lots and lots of places the important places are protected by that well\nI've always thought that schools in houses of worship should be protected as well not by government edict but voluntarily than it when you decide not to do that it's like me deciding not to wear my seatbelt I'm not blaming the victim I'm just saying I wear my seatbelt even though I've never had a seatbelt saved me from Syria's arm\nBut also where gun every day even though I've never had that saved me from serious harm yet\nThat's right but you never know when it's going to happen you never know what you're going to get a car accident you'd never know if you're going to get the gunfight at evil comes calling and so I'm with you\nI mean my goal is to empower every single person that wants to carry a firearm law in a law abiding fashion to have the right to do so so many places are trying to take away that right but that's all the second amendment is about is protecting yourself and your family so you have a right to do that and as soon as the liberals can realize the second amendment as\nElvis orders hold on it is not going away anytime soon the quicker they need to get over the hurdles of of trying to live in the states\n... the second amendment is Elvis orders hold on it is not going away anytime soon the quicker they need to get over the hurdles are trying to live in the fantasy world which somehow evil doesn't doesn't exist and so I'm with you about the line by omission does lead zones are dangerous and you can see this in\nEvery single news story that you either read or see on TV it's what they do tell\nYou in the story that is really is really the uh the deceitful now that's\nThat's the dog that's that's the dog doesn't bark watch her grandson field on enter a TV and granted it's always great talking to you thanks so much hold on for just a moment so my producers couldn't talk to you got a large large them show\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO
