they could come back from stuff [noise]\nUh you know I think [noise]\nPretty sure all of a series we're down a little bit and um there's games we were down and guys responded it seemed to have they seem to have a competence or mental toughness that I'm\nJim chip seems out\nOn different was that from prior years and we're might've come from last spring yeah I'm not sure where it\nCame from I

lot of fun I'm winning breaking through 'em and I think it'd be really fun for really really fun for him to do it again were\nYou surprised at all with what he did last year even aside from the postseason on regular season I'll put that season up against any of the prior twelve he had in his career to do what he did his age and ready to miles in the ... yeah I\nThink um you know he he paid really well I mean the playoffs I'm you know him a coup zero standing together [noise]\nI think he's got you know a lot of miles left him and he's still he's still reasonably young and enjoy playing a has a passion for the game and I think it really like to win another one\nLast year he accounted for for almost Twenty one percent of the scoring during the regular season you needed that out of him [noise]\nDo you need it to an extent this year or do you feel\nThere are players who can elevates as far as the goal scoring productivity is concerned I think\nBoth I think I think we need to be scoring uh to be successful as a team and I think um we have some guys that can get that next level this year I think Tom also become a Veronica Verkhovsky Keller can pick up where we left off last year so I think a sense of where we should be fun\nAt the time of this recording we're waiting for hearing for Tom coming up on Wednesday morning it was the thought that he might need to adjust his game you don't want to top line wing or being out of the line up for extended periods of time\nIn my opinion it's it's part of his game and it's maybe the cost of doing business the way he plays in the skill set that he has it does he need to adjust to a house so yeah I think he continually\nTries to evolve as a player I mean uh I think he's aware of what they're looking for what you know what triggers suspensions and\nA hot buttons for Claire safety uh but we still want him to be physical we still want her to play hard and can be [noise] um so I think as we go I mean we're going to deal with things and Tom is going to continue to evolve as a player\nIs that something you can control given the speed the nature of the game when when he's going as fast as he is which is maybe an underrated aspect of his game everyone's talking about the size and physicality fast he's going in there pretty fast no I Know and he\nHits a lot of force so I mean it's\nIt's [noise] he's\nHe's aware of what's going on and we continually\nWhat do you could do to adjust and how he is still be effective as a player we need them to be a physical part\nThird member of that top line and ... she has another level is that primarily away from the puck and and not only in shorthanded but even string situations as well\nYeah I think I mean I think is one of the better players and the league um and he has a chance to be you know he could only kill you can play power play\nAh there's still little things you can evolve and his game or face a [noise] a defensive responsibilities are but I just think he's going to continue to get better he's the\nType of person that studies the game that wants to get federal wants to be a complete player so I'm excited to see him play this year\nAnd our thanks to

O. it's\nIncredible experience as players you know\nEverybody has got to this level has tried you know winning a lot of things and sharing special moments with your teammates celebrating on the ice or in the locker room but like getting them getting ... ah you said with all your team which was very like a unique experience I haven't tried before a um so you see this kind of\nShiny thing\nFull of diamonds what's your name and number on it so it just puts a big smile on your face and it's a pretty it's a very unique cutting out the vote pride and\nSomething a you'll always have with you that nobody can take take away from you on\nShow ready to turn the page and look forward to this season but how are you able to draw off what you accomplished last spring because in some different feeling here this fall as compared to a year ago at this time\nYeah is it it's going to be a challenge I think it's ah probably harder to remain number one to to be to to get to that spot [noise]\nUh but I Believe I Do believe we have the right mentality for it I also think that experience will do as well to last year we got over that mentally mental harm to get over the second round your piece of Pittsburgh and then [noise]\nThen go all the way uh I think that the experience of\nKnowing what life is uh on what it takes is going to help us I really truly believe that I think there's still\nA lot of hunger within this team which is the most important thing to to to do it again there is a matter of the natural competitiveness uh within the room and that's what's going to carry us and I think we're still going to have that even\nRegardless of what happened last year\nYou know you guys talk during training camp and and the pre season here it's almost like a healthy swagger right\nI think it is I think [noise]\nI'm sure you've seen other teams that are or who I Do well a bit on it or maybe feel like they're better than they are in the beginning of the season [noise] uh and we're going to go I'm sure we're going to go through rough stretch within the season about but I just I just think that [noise]\nIt's it's gonna do what we did last year is going to\nThis team and even the confidence\nYourself to a couple of big goals in the postseason but are there or is there a moment aside from Boise in the cup and Vegas is there a moment or two that during the summer you thought back on and said man that that really was something [noise]\nThere's so many things about Vegas that was so special moments you think back on I mean the celebration in the locker room after it was\nBoss and there was so special\nYou know that time on my right or wrong you know lifting the cop on the ice being being there on the ice with my family uh definitely things stand out\nJust like I think that whole journey\nRight from the first series what we what we went through with all different kinds of adversity being down in our series a I mean there's so many things that come to mind but\nVegas was an unbelievable experience\nWaiting all summer to ask you this the ... which school do you think it's bigger honestly ... the double O T winter against Columbus where the game five winter again Vegas [laughter] um [noise]\nI think the ah it can be selfish share ... which one is we are I that I think the bigger one was Columbus by the ...\nThe biggest go felt better felt way better yeah\nIt's a good way to put it and you've been no stranger to acknowledging that you've watched that a few times\nYeah now you can I can watch it on a million times I I've watched other\nHighlights of this team a million times even other players or ankles and\nUh 'cause you just get a sense of that journey from like the first series for the last like and that's just the playoffs and that when you watch these videos like genome I\nFeel like such a long way from the first little asks and like I said being down every series that was just an emotional roller coaster within the\nSometimes within the get most of the times within every game but also within every series so it's so many ups and downs and just take such an emotional toll on you [noise]\nBut then it just feels so much better in the end what it's all over and you're you're doing the champion so\nYeah it's amazing I applied I Love watching these videos and and I know there was one on on I ...

need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole family\nAnd while your wife is ... no\nNo that's not going to work out for you that's going to end poorly aren't going to share your bag thanks for calling in ban is one of those bands in Colorado Springs I ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and we've got the thousand dollars for your baby step on\nAnd art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan but you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always there I Need to have\nOh you know two two months or so a income to fall back on in ... tip to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work but he does not she's a stay at home mother and are you sure you're not making any money in the real estate business\nWhile I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year\nSo more in there they are not having zero months\nNot any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um\nA month or slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter when we're at right\nNow I don't I don't I never expand baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so\nSet some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add that\nIn the valley account the hill and valley is the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts wanted for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much\nBut you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money a year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are than okay\nSet some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is and uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly house a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thanks Dave hey it's a great honor to talk [noise] yeah I Know you had a great impact on changed my life five years ago um do you think you are currently I I I got a career question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my arm do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture\nI was making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more you making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year where do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year when your\nQuestions what I make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nYeah I'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less [noise]\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you'd probably find somebody with an Asian culture and pay you what your worse\nThis is the day Ramsey shows\nYou know statistically when it comes to life insurance and protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nUh read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap\nAnd they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated or not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and I kind of ...\nJewish and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get\nBut you know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff right you're doing it's a blessing thank you um how will be needing a lakeside saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I uh probably should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA or four one K.\nWas that just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know who you can put you come out they're matching a couple of hundred bucks a year in more\nOkay show the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you're going to happen to him years what is it\nI think it'll ever ooh I got home yes see so you know fortunately is something you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know [laughter] oh okay how I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to you know retire early you know if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health

fascinating in the old man sprang up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down he\nWas still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night harkening to the death watches and the wall presently I heard a slight grown and I knew it was the grownup mortal terror it was not a grown the pain or of grief\nIt was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with all I knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world's slapped was wild up from my own ... deepening with the dreadful echo the terrorists that distracted me\nI say I knew it well I knew what the old man felt pity him although white chuckled at

this\n... concerned with how the world is the United states [noise] um the hearing things changed my point of view because I met with judge Kavanaugh after reading his opinions lowering the articles and what documents we can get from the administration\nAnd I decided after the hearing to oppose his nomination for a couple of important philosophical grounds mainly that he was too willing to just defer to the executive and not in independent check\nBut the allegations that came out from doctor for it I think are very very serious\nFirst of all you're jumping on this ... you know the his deference to the executive without a check\nOh ... than came up from doctor for it I think are very very serious you\nKnow first of all the jumping on the sea you know his deference to the executive without a check what in anything that Brett Kavanaugh has done or said says yeah whatever the governor says or whatever the president says is okay by me\nSay this is where it because it it's an isolated for them who in the audience is able to go back in fact check it oh we've got the the fact checkers out there saying\nCorey storage claimed by the Seventeen million dollars well some of them are Congress people and some of them in some of them are just harassment assault sexual\nIt's still a cover up of harassment charges\nAnd they are\nCongressional staffer it's it is a slush fund specifically for but let me go get back to them gains answer on Brett Kavanaugh I'm Sorry but but nobody fact checking that\nAnd I think it was important that the hearings be held so that we send a message to women or anybody who suffers from sexual assault that this is a serious matter and we need to get to the bottom of it\nUm I think it's very important that we have these hearings apparently an FBI report is down near available for us to review I Will be reviewing it and there will be a vote soon but I think the important thing is to send that message that we take claims of sexual assault

storming for a lot of Senate candidates why hasn't he born storm for Cory well the same reason the a GOP hasn't sent money and because you know they they look at these folks like Gallup\nA and these folks who are doing you know the Washington Post polls are because they don't support all candidates equally or here's the dirty little secret Nick previous wasn't going to get a red cent either from the G O P uh even though the never curries are out there saying well you see ... recordings are giving anybody from the G O be neither would neck\nBecause the G O P treats\nOr you know they they look at these things with the wind ability factor they determine whether or not or a Republican could ever win in Charlottesville and they bail or they don't support album are all county\nGuess what Republican Party of Virginia is the reason the Republicans don't win in Charlottesville because there's no support there they they look at it as a quote\nLost cause they don't support George urban or Mike they'll roast so oh they have real party chairs there but they don't send any support were red headed step children as far as they're concerned\nOh it's quaint you got conservative talk show host

um it ended up in record\nJames how're you doing this morning or Dr ... got a good deal I mean they already rubber gloves that's all I'm telling you [laughter] anyway what's on your mind that this morning was the first and foremost let's let's make the case for course or do you think the arguments he's making regarding defending himself in this attacks on uh\nWhat do you do first and foremost let's let's make the case for Cory sort of do you think the arguments he's making regarding defending himself in this attacks on the statues and Confederate monuments and that kind of stuff is a good\nPoint to make both in the hypocrisy of the uh the slush fund to cover up sexual harassment cases and to settle sexual harassment cases in the Senate and and then more over Tim Kaine's association with Leslie Coburn here in the fifth district\nWell I think those are two excellent point to bring up and to continue to bring up because the left runs the narrative in the mainstream media and if when it's like that are brought up on a\nDaily basis or no matter how many people watch or listen to the you know listen to the debate or anything I think that just needs to be kinda Hamburg in you know you've got you've got senators George sitting here judging cases who are who are admittedly I'm\nGuilty by their own admission of the same issues that they're judging and um or you got like ... Coburn see Cate silent as he said oh Leslie ... selling Coburn is out there you know just admitted or openly without even a\nIn a parade bashing or our closest ally\nUh over in the middle east of aunts and so I got that something that a court needs to be able to stay on and he he can stand on end should be able to because I Know that with Donald Donald Trump did he came out and he didn't need to be president and he just said this is laid it out on line this is who I Am this is the way I Will\nUh ... what would work as president and you know like it or leave it and um and I in Korea needs to do the exact same thing and I think you made in ... the ending comparison between a Prince William county in green county because that's something that just all scratched my head on of\nYou know up here in green county how is it that the account he went to one for president\n... years ago yet we do have\nOne you know just an credibly progressive a ... a\nBoard of supervisors up here and ... and I think ah you know that you were saying earlier the G O P than you know given up on or are not supporting a Corey Stewart or anything it dabbling down in Charlotte ... uh just needs to look back\nOn governor McDonald came through a Republican\nAnd actually start wearing out the rubber on issues like you're in for a recovery and\nSaid I'm Single and said earlier by a few days ago I think with you\nWhen he was on his ah Kevin McCarthy and I'm aware now that rubber and it works right here after\nAnd and you know until Robert Tracy came along Bob McDonnell's the only Republican to win county wide the album rural county I'm In a long time I mean we've had we've had some supervisors when but you really it's not about you know oh he's got an hour he's got a red sign he's got a blue neck tie it's about it\nYou know getting to know people it's about shaking hands with people it's it's that retail probably this is why Trump won and if Corey Stewart does this and does it right it doesn't matter how much money the G O P send him\nA ... because you know what's gonna happen is really good to ... late October and all of a sudden polls are going to show the race tightening up and the geo peace going to try to all of a sudden run in and throw big bags of money at him\nEncouraged this sort of behavior bear responsibility for you know raining that scene because surely they makes nice theater and and uh I get a fifty percent of twenty percent voter turnout so I when the congressional seat but what does it leave in its wake\nWell I don't think that there's a a coincidence that ramping up a partisan divide happens\nEvery time there's an election season comes around it seems like it's a ramping up\nReal good presently I'm and of course that means that the the people who have something to gain something to profit buyer to power to win by\nA as I as as I put it in terms of comic book characters consistent with my book superhero FX as if they want to enlist uh you know ordinary folk as their their henchmen there lackeys a\nAnd a cannon fodder in some sort of a battle that's our because because you know there there is an awful lot at stake a but you're right my concern today right now is uh\nBecause because you know there there is an awful lot at stake\nA but you're right my concern today right now is a more about what does that do to us what does that to how we how are we going to continue to do business with the people know that we have to do business with how we gonna or are we going to get along with our neighbors how we're going to continue to\nCommunicate with each other or ... or it's going to happen to our trust or what's gonna happen to\nUh our our ability to uh you know not just learn how to get along but have have the kind of civilized arguments and discourse is necessary in order that\nYou know people might be persuaded to change their minds instead you get people who are just going to totally a dig their heels in and everybody takes the most extreme version of their own position\nAnd then what's worse I think that everybody attributes the most extreme\nOr the most ... version of their opponents perspective or motivations are intentions to cast them in the role of the villain because in order to be as big of a hero\nAs you want to be you need as big of a villain out there and just to stand up against but when you're dealing with you know yelling at people on social media that it's not mess not particularly heroic\nI don't see much risk or sacrifice being\nMade by people who ... or engage in some sort of you know online posse\nAnd end up posse becomes real when we see things like Ted Cruz being shouted out of a restaurant how does how does somebody run a public space even a radio station can be victimized by it uh I have\nA sister stations here at our flagship and they're threatened by people who say well you you allow this radio station do exist so therefore we must protest you because uh you can ill afford it or we feel like you can be pushed around we see restaurants movie theaters\nAre targeted the gods Nell movie premieres being cancelled because of a riots and threats against private property I have you is this part and parcel also this cavalier attitude towards private property as somehow being a\nUm a some sort of class warfare a professional\n... I think it goes beyond class warfare and now in terms of the number of ways in which populations are divided against each other so you know or the new old fashioned Marxist used to just say everything was really just a matter of class and it was\nThe ... versus the ... and every conflict needs to be reduced to an understood\nOn land those terms of the strategy today is the opposite the strategy of the day is to proliferate\nThe number of ways in which you can claim that\nJust disagreement maybe in ... and not just there's just sometimes there's a real injustice this question of how do you how do you try to address some seek redress for injustices right\nAh um but it's it's it's let's split people in it and create as many antagonism as possible and then take each ... each of those ...\nAnd create almost the lowest cartoonist care cartoonish caricature of it and treat that as if that's the reality and paint the character's involved in it as if you're dealing with the difference between saying some demons I pointed out that\nYou know the language of either you're with us or you're against us as the language of war and all that for the first appear in the gospels but it's in the context\nOf you know the the conflict between the Holy Spirit and the demonic ... you know I mean if you're on TALK about a war on a cosmic scale that would be the that would that would be ...\nWell the spirit of the demonic ... you know I mean if you're on TALK about a war on a cosmic scale that would be the that would that would be that you're in all\nThat but portraying or or or or domestic dispute a as if we were participating in the war between the Holy Spirit and the demonic\nUm that that that that that's the that's extreme to me\nI hang on one second professor it's a professor ...

eight six six halo urge to join the conversation oh welcome back to the Lars Larson Joe well we've\nHeard some of the reaction from some of the Senate leadership\nThat said that they believe that all the Democrats are trying to do now is delay and delay and delay we've also heard that some of those who managed to read the investigation the quick additional background check that was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough and now at this point the Democrats are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting I was going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nMy friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and former federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on I Want to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do the traditional background checking and those who've read it say the report shows\nNothing new that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by boat judge Kavanaugh and ... for\nWell thanks so much lord there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously\nWell thanks so much Lars there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin\nAnd that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to corroborate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the light you have forty nine Democrats who do not want to have a fifth\nReliable conservative vote on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this\nBeyond the midterms so that the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and can defeat a cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat\nMerrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy or in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to try to impeach him but I I look to the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this for the weekend Lars but there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on that are no longer\nThe kind of norms that you can absolutely bank on I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um that that we maintain the tradition that judges can't be a it can't be impeached unless they've engaged in some kind of a misconduct or use their offices abusive late but\nYou know there's all kinds of norms that we've we've had that are no longer you know you you've had two or three generations of students who have been told that norms are\nBasically uh instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and denied their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been to explain my audience and I think you'd back me up on those and told me if I'm wrong that if they adapted to an eight member court would have been back to be effectively made a lot of the tightest decisions of for foreign effectively and know it would have new to the Supreme Court to a large extent\nBut could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh and and by doing I Would still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\nI think she would because he would just put his head down and continue\nTo do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him on the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed is so remote\nA ... as to be a loose ori that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrat Scott ... majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would count for much\nAndy I ask you legal questions because your background is in federal prosecutor the guy with the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left or ... dodging America and he was a great example of it but let me ask you a political question do you think\nAnd he by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left her ... dodging America and here's a great example of it but let me ask you a political question\nDo you think that the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today that it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout does Senator John Cornyn drought today\nDo you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes this fall\nWell I think laws if you look at it as I understand it if you look at for example the the polling that we're all looking so carefully at\nOf the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively or trying to hang on what we're seeing is that\nThere's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power and in this case the the left with Trump and has been very animated and where it's all very excited about the idea of of voting against\nTrump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh what they've done is awake and\nThey usually more than a party in power for the ... and mid term elections and all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on they people looking at this and they're frightened by it\nAnd that means that the they miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do a name to charge were Dr Ford's name has come out Christine Ford\nAnd that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweat neck which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got all kinds of of other baggage she brings with her and then as they did that\nThey started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turnout Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp has come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit her good faith that Jim was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous people now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it it turns this whole\nIdea of advice and consent and search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life\nDestroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should rightly be frightened by that\nTwenty almost Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was used I think it will inappropriately Jeanette friend or a real a real creep and Bill Clinton or where you'll rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women and at that time they said oh you can't engage in the past\nA real creep and Bill Clinton or what you'll rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women\nAnd at that time they said oh you can't engage in the politics of personal destruction I guess unless it it benefits your side and I hope Republicans see all this and say we're never going to behave this way no matter how much it might cost us so we will not do it I I I for the most part I don't think they will\nWell Jerry why what more did the you know that\nWhat more do the FBI need to as Dr ...\n... where you can ask a follow up questions I'd\nCrush on a long time what you don't want you to know the location you could ask questions about it we have this kind

I'm trying to be reason I'm going to keep my question shirt you keep your answer short she was asked where this happened she doesn't know where it happened you know when it happened or even what era to happen and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and sent its best age in it\nDoesn't know where it happened you know when it happened or even what you were to happen and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and soon as best age and in and said ask her again you know where is the answer would drain\nThe heat actually she knows more information than that how do you know ... to that than what it does she stay with us so we we're pretty close we are actually there were questions are getting where exactly what time of please\nGive us happened what time of year and the Republicans cut short the questioning by that he looked less sugar they brought in the Republicans\nCouldn't hold on hold on a jury Gary ... when\nYou miss the facts the Republicans got five minutes at a time and they turn their time over to the professional sex crimes investigator with Democrats each each of the questions on the panel got five minutes at a time the got exactly the same amount of time\nAnd and one of them spend all his time asking about sports and and about uh about what's flying was in high school or you know and what devil's triangle was which turns out to be a drinking game just as he said so when you say the Democrats didn't have time to ask her word happen\nShe's been very clear in all the things you said in her letter to find signs in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened a jury you realize how ridiculous is is to say we've only the FBI to ask that question for five more times her answer might have changed\nLet's go to another nicer nana\nThat's where we go my wife when the grandbabies around mental welcome to the program\nA high Lars I I uh I just wanted to say that um [noise] I Am one of the millions in a woman and I'm not\nOn here to complain but um I Am here to say that you\nKnow\nFor a good portion of my life since I was four I've had a me on the forehead and as I grew up\nAs an adult you know I wasn't going to be the victim anymore but what you do is you lean women gained an insight to people especially men um\nNow I don't want I ...
