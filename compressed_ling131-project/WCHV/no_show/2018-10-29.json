Timothy\nI Want you to listen to what I'm saying an ounce bottles when you talk to somebody and when they talk to you it is important to think about what they're saying right it's important to pay

a lot of\nThings for example in chapter one birthday he said the bean belt therefore ashamed of the testimony of are lower in order to me as prisoner and that's one thing that Paul wanted somebody to remember and burst twelve\nHour we solve this a couple of weeks ago he said Timothy ... for the which cause I also suffer these things\nNevertheless I'm not ashamed for I Know in my belief and persuaded but he's able to keep that which I committed in he was saying to me I Want you to to think about the fact that you can lose your salvation\nAnd now in for seven years he was on and he he shares three or four other very important things that he wants us to listen to and he says consider what I say that it I Want you to think about what I'm saying consider what I say\nAnd the lord the understanding and all things that it's been a all of these things he said remember that Jesus Christ of the seat of David Was raised from the dead according to my gospel I Want to preach than I Am an

wants that in fact a saving doesn't want people to think in fact he does everything possible to keep from thinking\nDie but he rose again and here's a news flash for all his ministers out there and

seventeenth piece of Christ beef and not raise your faith here the pain and and he also said and and your yet and your sense\nI mean you think about it uh for anybody minister not to ... who calls himself a Christian for them to not except the kernel of truth that Jesus Christ rose from the dead then they buy their own admission are still in their own since\nWe have no part in from Senate without Jesus Christ rising from the dead we don't have learned from since you don't want to know why because the price did not conquer the\nGrave than he did in Congress in either but I'm Glad I use

come for all of us at the lord ... uh but you know sometimes those of us that are born again we'll we'll likewise heavier resurrection as well\nAs a matter of fact appalled to the church if that's the one I go he said at first this longing for sixteen for the lord himself shell to send from heaven with the ... out with the voice of the arc an angel and with the Trump of God and noticed is the debt in crisis arise\nSee I'm going to not one day and let's Jesus rafters me I'm going to do one day and you will do as well\nHowever uh on the day Chrysler does ... for the church if I'm already gone he's going to wake me up praise God he's a he's got Louis me out of the greatest he's got to give me a resurrection I praise God for that now by the way when I think about that though and I realized that uh I'm going to resurrect also\nI Hope that will cause me to live accordingly\nYou want to know why\nI could be\nA rash or to or resurrected anytime\nNow and now obviously on I'm Alive now I so uh I I'm not dead right now a show so I guess I Am for for the record\nFor me it's eminent it could have taken place at any moment now I Want you to put yourself at a ... if you would in a situation I Want you to imagine that you're going along through life and you're not even thinking about heaven you are a Christian but you know he's thinking about it and all of a sudden all of a sudden the Lord Jesus Christ rafters\nYou he ... he translates you and takes you to heaven\nAnd you're not living for God wouldn't that be an embarrassing situation now where say praise God but I don't want to be embarrassed I don't want to embarrass my lord so\nA pause it I Want you to think about what I'm saying I Want you to remember that the Lord Jesus Christ of was raised in the day and hopefully that'll make us\nConsider our own resurrection one day and little accordingly poll also a said it was the second thing he wants us to remember a and a number two he wants us to remember that even when we're bound his word isn't in fact in back in our tax there in second Timothy to versus non\nPaul said and again this is a continuation of the thoughts inverse number eight here he talked about the resurrection of Christ in birds they emerged now he says we are in or in other words that deals with the resurrection of Christ wherein I suffered trouble as an evil do or\nSee the apostle Paul when they staunch preacher or the resurrection and and now he says because I Am a staunch preacher the resurrection of Christ has suffered trouble I I Am fact even in the bonds you said a and it seems pause persecuted\nFor simply preaching the facts that Jesus Christ rose against didn't want her to want to\nSay and don't like the doctrine\nAt all because without the resurrection where we're hopeless\nAnd also meant I Am a I\nSeparate drone out I ...\nI I mean even in bonds but he said however the word of God is not bound\nSeparate drone out I ... I I mean even in\nBonds but he said however the word of God is not bound\nSo what does that mean well here's what that means\nA and by the way Paul did suffer didn't they in fact I Want you to read some time when you have an opportunity second Clinton's eleven twenty three twenty seven he talks about all that he went through but uh but\nWhen it said there but gosh where does not bound he sent listen even though I'm they suffered persecution for preaching the truth and even though I might be found\nThe promises of God's word or not bound\nYou say well ... well first of all the Lord Jesus Christ will never\nLeave us nor per se 'cause\nEven if we're persecuted for preaching the truth aren't you glad about that\nHe will never ever leave us nor the ever present goes and a ... and then a notice also\nAnother promise from God told told the guy told\nAll rather he says Paul I know you're you had to do in the flesh he said but my research sufficient for you argue about it and how about this problem is I Love his promise in second Christians for sixteen positive for the which calls we faint not\nBut we're outward man's parish yet the N. word manage renewed day by day for our light pollution or tribulation in bus for a moment but it will work for us a farm or exceeding eternal where the glory of the worst\nThat we may have affliction and maybe your wife or heavy okay but it's just for a moment\nAnd that is ... is actually working for our benefits that shit promise of God\nAnd here's the point no matter how much are suffering tonight as a Christian maybe you're you're sharing the truth of the resurrection or maybe even ... that God has she may be bound because of it but God promises are not bound\nHe's never going to leave our side so he said I Want you to remember that thing I Want you to think about that and then a third thing here tonight\nAs weak Haitian on non wants us to remember a not only that a V. Jesus rose from the dead end that were not bound or did his promises rather on a balance even if we are he wants us to remember that our endurance if we hang in there for God might lead\nTo the salvation or the last in fact notice first ten seconds second Timothy gender a to\nHe said there before and when you see therefore what are you supposed to look to see what if they're for he says there for under all things\nWhether you like say that they and they also obtained the celebration which isn't Christ Jesus you know what he's saying\nThat yes that one out of ... I'm going to be a persecuted I'm going to be a in a bad way I might even be bound for it or he said uh but I'm going to end or all things I'm gonna I'm gonna stay under that I'm going to put up with that\nSo that I might get an opportunity to lead people to Christ\nNow let me just make a a physician here or what happens with the ... it was for the last people if say people\nDo say I've had enough I'd been\nPreaching all this time off and sharing my faith and telling people that Jesus is alive and he's not dead that he did rise bodily and always got me as headaches heartache and persecution I'm not doing it anymore\nBut what happens all people well my next week\nAnd I just made that clear\nAnd saying here's what Paul said in Romans chapter attend a inverse number fourteen he says how men shall they call on him and who they believe in house show they believe in him\nUnder a tent and a and verse number of fourteen he says how then shall they call on him and who they believe\nAnd how shall we believe in him was in the earth and how shall we hear that a preacher\nInterview and I give up just because we're\nPersecuted we may not see people said that you know what if we just hang in there to keep on being safe all persecution or not God am I just said people who are alive and that the point of saying\nListen he wants us to remember the things he wants to have to remember that the list in his words not bound\nBy his promises are always true he wants us to remember that when the harshest come along that we can be faithful finally tonight God wants us to remember a bad weather and we are not he is always staple and noticed quickly inverse number Thirteen\nPoll said\nIf we believe not yet he abide faithful and there was this next brave picking on deny him so you know what that means safe all this is an integral part of God's character\nYou know when you hear curse than send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the follow up on a nearly died\nA show on when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know troops will I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our a ten but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives and as we would\nWe would line up on a taxi way as the ... the flag draped casket would come through and there was ... it was a silence there\nAnd everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and so Americans perished over this\n... you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you ... said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more\nAre both on the ground in the air and on the C I mean this is this is you know why we fight to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties\nA and it you know this is you know in addition to this a comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and\nShe also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to a flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons in saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east\nSo this isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump\nAt Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros Chuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history\nA lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot literally coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that his was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited\nTo Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nAbsolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in our internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cast a we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you're right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have a ... a number of independents and Republicans whoever's\nI Know they're on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have enough of a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not tuning it unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played at cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars to make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to have to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nKnow I'm I've only gotten too good to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it would be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than a loan on her\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women\nWear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense or fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing\nAh to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not the\n... was a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly are we we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen to overturn it and make sure that our values\nWere stood stood up for ... yeah well I really do we both love and why the president a new one here I'm a bit more to make is Ali if\nYou're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention versed in cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you accuse them of torture as well\nUh she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a rare again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best playing for the president or\nThis is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely what President job uh it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taken advantage of\nIt has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been down there many times they don't\nThey released into the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded this is not church President Trump's fault it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing our border and the ...\nThey're the highest ever recorded this is not ... it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing the border and the president is frustrated adding I and you need to use everything he's got in there to to ... to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they usually toward building the wall and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bales thirty eight billion dollars including building the wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill and getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued either Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice and fourteen and favorite county which has no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now at trees and the conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that I and and towards something that gives more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing this one size fits all top down penalties taxes mandate it's failed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote\nI I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nOh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr I ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as the not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nIt'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier going up against a very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for

confirmed that this is this is oh hold it it's a chance for us to get some attention again\nI got something to say well no\nBuy if you're out there listening\nFirst of all why what is ... you know ...\nUniversity of Virginia bought a house\nFirst of all why what is ... you know ...\nUniversity of Virginia to bought a house you certainly are Abu I Can't say that you really only rabbi I don't know how he feels about it but I don't know how I feel about it you can't blame this on Charlottesville you gotta blame it on the person who did it the blame it on the Nazis can't believe this guy from that job goes out there and does this\nAnd you want to blame it on what happened here in Charlottesville which had nothing to do with what happened to Pittsburgh\nBut isn't isn't blaming what happened to these you know eleven dead in Pittsburgh\nBlaming it on Charlottesville is sort of like this whack job hours I shouldn't even mention his name 'cause he's getting publicity out of it\nThis whack job blaming his site you know or or Dylann Roof or Jason Kessler or any number of people who blame their situation on other people\nAs I enter Brian to your your all these folks who blame their position on someone else it's somebody else's screwing me I'm not you know the Charlottesville high school has a a niche have made gap because they're racist the school that by a black woman\nOr the quarter million dollar school superintendent blaming it ... blaming Pittsburgh on Charlottesville seems like it's cut from the same bolts of the fabric\nOkay here's my take on somebody wants to blame a tragedy that happened somewhere else\nOn something that happened two years ago here in Charlottesville this is absolutely insane it's it sounds like it's a political being like what does this political while I don't understand I don't understand what you're doing rap I\nI I think it's more than political it's it's a tension getting\nAn end up not right because that's that's what bothers me the most about it and and what's happened is\nThis rabbi is going to make hot and cold running appearances and I doubt if he's listening because he's up somewhere getting ready for his appearances on the weekday morning talkers\nI'll I'll I'll bet you a dollar to a condition\nThat this guy is on at very least the today show or whatever MSNBC you show or the Morning Joe oh that that's probably it I'll bet I'll bet you you find him on MORNING Joe today\nBecause they're going to make the guys will look here's the rabbi of Charlottesville and he's got to present and I and I will if he denies that he's the only rabbi in Charlottesville I\nI Will eat give filter fish\nYou can bring the fish in and I will consume it live on the air I Will bet you he doesn't if he's portrayed as the only rabbi of Charlottesville he will not do me or that misconception\nAnd and and that some men sit for me I mean we were speaking of hypothetical but I'm sure this guy\nOr is it because the news media has run with this all weekend that Charlottesville is to blame for Pittsburgh\nBut if you say to somebody your poor because they have money and they're not giving you any\nOh I had this debate with a young man who's a an occasional listener\nShe's a nurse in the emergency room at the University of Virginia hospital\nAnd he and I went back and forth over the weekend a few times in email\nBecause he is convinced that his\nChallenges economically our because somebody is keeping money from him that if they have money there's only a finite amount of it and if they have it that's why he doesn't\nWhat makes America unique is ... it was founded on the idea that if you work really hard\nAnd have a unique skill that people will pay money for you will\nAchieve and despite the best efforts of our elected class who threw cronyism\nAnd backroom handshake wink and a nod deals\nAnd their efforts to retard that\nThe most part it's still applicable\nDespite their best efforts and believe me there are efforts are profound\nThe most part it's still applicable\nDespite their best efforts and believe me there are efforts are profound\nThe ideas that you can write laws to benefit\n... group one group over another\nShort it exists that isn't being it's a blame game\nThat's that through the email Joe WC gauge the dot com\nBoom we you know we in the conservative movement do the same thing we we come in and we blame the progressive for everything\nAnd you can follow a chain of events that brings us to Marx Brothers weekend here in Charlottesville of twenty Seventeen\nAnd it all begins with Dylann Roof shooting\nWhen the city counselors\nDecided that would be a great opportunity to start taking down Confederate statues\nAgain blaming something irrelevant\nSometimes in an attempt to get attention for yourself\nSometimes to appear to have been doing something\nBecause they already could see that the black community was starting to not by this hold a vote for me\nAnd then I'll make your life better because fifty years later and they were starting to catch on that maybe that wasn't\nThe majority of the progressive movement is they would always washed rents and repeat with a different looking progressive somebody would new would come in and\nSay no no no that was the last guy it was bad he was ... for me this time all be better than the last guy\nMike signature is going

they failed they failure vote for me I'll do it this time\nI don't know this\nShooter's story\nThe uniqueness of this Pittsburgh story is that\nThis shooter in his arrogance was actually walking out of the place like he was going to go home and have a you know a cup of coffee and breakfast sandwich\nWhen the SWAT Team showed up and he's like oh God damn\nI thought I was just going to go home I mean I don't know how the way that you have to be the thing you can go pull off something like ... walk home\nBut for his hubris for his insanity\nIs in custody and will face the judge today\nBut the news media has spent the weekend blaming Pittsburgh on us using the president of\nThis temple and his column in USA Today is the proof\nAgain it's an opinion column and it's being used as proof\nWhile we in Charlottesville get some more attention for ourselves\nMeanwhile there's eleven families\nWho are devastated because somebody went to temple and didn't come home\nBecause somebody yells decided that there are problems were because these people exist and\nIt is singularly and I don't\nCare what membership you call your most gringo macho just texted me\nThrough the Twitter feed that Joe Thomas

matter of public record and I think that's a little chilling to wear one Senate candidate\nTo be kind of making this honestly to vote and vote for the right person because we're going to know who your vote for a you know that ... that that backhanded stuff really bothers me but there's been huge voter registration drives over the last few months\nYeah they're really high and you know I serve on that a committee and the Senate\nThe privileges and elections committee we've noticed a lot of that yet we still get accused of voter suppression and uh you know a big part of it is just making sure that\nAh anyone who wants to vote to judge will to vote is registered and they have that opportunity but ah yeah we've got to get out we got to do some hard work started early backwards planner and\nAnd uh your uh we'd better get out in front of this then you know if you don't then you'll plan to fail and\nUh I had a heart races before as we all know that uh the district in which I represent a\nIs a tough district for Republican to win so we'll just get out will continue to do the things we're going to do you know the judge grow a friday night and our comments had a great comment she said I don't know where a a\nPeople the people on the left the Braves are and I don't know where people you know to the rotted more but I Know the prices is the right guy for the job done the job and so

feel like if it wasn't for Republicans Republicans would never lose elections um you know those who have you had a very contentious lieutenant governor's race couple of years ago\nAre their scars still from that that might keep Republicans from your district from voting for you and if so how do you how do you get them back I mean we watched it in twenty Thirteen with Cuccinelli in bowling and now you know and\nUh and we we were left with Terry McAuliffe in the substantive change in\nHow Virginia acts as a government I mean you know if you ... what do you say the Republicans that might sit there and say I don't know maybe we deserve a Democrat in this district just to teach them a lesson\nWell I think a address your first part of your question with what's happened uh after bowl and I went after each other you know I think people know uh especially they know now today\nBased on what's been laid out there and a Vogel a false accusations that she laid out I think that really hurt her and I'm sure I've got a little bit of a\nFaith against me even though we had all the evidence and all that stuff but I put that behind us and look at people don't want to vote for us for one issue or one thing like that ah that's fine\nYou know a wish they wouldn't be single minded single focus like that uh but uh by large we need to go out and buy the new voters in our area and we're doing that and then when he talked are independents and Democrats alike I've got a lot of Democrats and the love what we're doing because look we're right of center\nUh and uh you know but I find the center on multiple occasions to go get the things done that we need to get done I think people by and large and you're seeing it manifest itself because people are just finally had enough\nOf this back and forth in this uh DC politics and what's happening\nAnd so um I think\nGod like myself are always tend to try to just do the right thing all the time and and get it done\nWhen did you take away from the massive\nWalk away march on Saturday ah the walk away movement is really based you know up up near Fredericksburg in northern Virginia where a lot of Democrats or this is not a you know whether it's mobs not jobs or walk away\nOr I feel like you know the this move to polarize this has really put a lot more people saying I I have no idea who I Am anymore\nWell you know I'll give you a good case in point my father's year actually to watch I I mean in high school football that's just something that I hadn't told anybody lately a kind of get to myself that I Need a little hiatus from all

why are you doing John I just\nDon't know [laughter] and uh\nYou know Joe that's that's the voter out that's out there today and they watch the news and and some people understand that the news today

[noise] I think your position in this fight those [noise]\nFreshly back from the ... festival your sort of old nationalism there were some there was a Scottish nationalism\nGoing on around there uh but uh you know we don't let me forget we got to circle back to the story of the family crest of the cockburn planned\nOr that we found there and the interesting questions it raises but right now we're visiting with rabbi Ari Spiro of the national conference of Jewish affairs author of the new book\nPushback and certainly obviously we're talking a as a jumping off point this horrific a massacre in Pittsburgh not far from a you're part of Ohio rabbi Spiro I and so I Know it it hits home and and the community\nYou as you mentioned is that that that ...\nTortured feeling that there is no sanctuary anymore whether it be the [noise] the shooting at the church in Charleston South Carolina and now this a shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nUh but but worse than that as the after effect and those who are we left off we were kind of talking about this ... use of this tragedy\nAre for politics and and unfortunately we saw this in the mid thirties and Germany or we've seen time and time again the use of tragedy for political gain and I think it's a dark part in our spirit how do we feel that\nI'm a rabbi or you know just as a man of faith you know how does a community get back to where it doesn't matter uh as so damn much who our politicians are versus who we are as people\nWell I think in the days of oh not that far back maybe twenty five thirty years ago we could get to a comedy uh because Democrats or Republicans\nAre there are differences were rather slight compared to today ... ... if you have to de\n... uh liberalism that have actually turned into a ... and ... there's a real kalemkarian aspect to it and uh so I I don't know what\nAre they will really do for the sake of concrete because raptors doesn't believe in in the country or or nationalism or are people who believe in a I'm a ... idea\nBelieve in in the country or or nationalism or are people who believes in a I'm a ... idea that those who are um are ...\n... ... ... there were above this idea of of the nation heard or individual citizenship\nThey have the right to control the society and that's\nEven more important than a nationalism or or patriotism or our sovereignty and so we're dealing with people here on the left that I'm a I don't know that they will stop because I think that the\n... being the um the agenda of the multi cultural is this is so strong\nThat nothing rises and their need for craft nationalism or multiculturalism are socialism that's what's so dangerous about the left as opposed to just old fashioned liberalism so I don't know but I Do know that we ... that are conservative\nYou cannot remain silent or your bully they're intimidated the I'm\nNot expressing what we believe we\nHave that allow that to happen in and they have a First Amendment and that's what this country is all about\nThat that conservatives him I think it's important that you bring a rabbi because you know an American conservative you know believes in the that idea that your faces a personal journey for you and it has nothing to do with me\nUh and and that kind of turning us you know finding anything to turn against one another so that there are people can win an election I don't know if our face have been so co-opted since the days of Roman Jerusalem the sins punches pilots are but it seems like every time we turn around they're finding ways to inflame is against each other\nUm ... do you think that there's ... and ironically if you actually listen to the words the president says he's the least of these actors yet or the the more he sits there and says how horrified to use of it\nThe more the media sneakers and says yeah that's a dog whistle we know what he really means or is it no longer does anyone even have to say anything anymore these media arbiters\nUm get to do it is that we're a great danger that my industry the media loses its place and then who replaces them to you know cause that scares me even more is the idea of a government replacing the media would some propaganda ministry ...\nWell the president is deeply\nPained by there's there's no question and to say otherwise it's just it's a it's fake it's wrong\nIt's a ... part of the media the media will not be replaced by a government ... most of the media which are liberal the mainstream media\nThat's exactly what are the the ... the establishment want they they agree with the media so why would they get away why would they do away why would they do away with a very instrument that's been successfully\nUm can communicating their their their left wing masters but maybe it's been a wonderful the extra money for them I'm Out conservative maybe is great but they're not they're not the mainstream\n... um the powerhouses of the CBS ABC New York times or so there's no reason for the the deep state to get rid of them ... they've already have them on their side so I don't know what the answer is but I Do know that we cannot be silos or bullying Timothy ...\nWhen we cannot accept ...\nThey're false narratives about Russia collusion ... or if it's about a so called white privilege or how a pay cut\nThere are two block Russia collusion and or if it's about a so called white privilege or how our patriotism if something bad or the President Trump has a\nHigh minority we kept except for self respecting ... believes in intellectual integrity you have to fight back against that path of free speech is about and that's what no below the is about ... about so we can't become silent 'cause I'll tell you for the other side is not going to stop\nThe only way to stop the other side as a base either strengthen the power of our site when I say power I mean the the idea the verbal power\nA rabbi last one for you and again the book is push back in and it said Amazon do you keep a separate website for folks who might want to get the book directly from you or should people just go to the Amazon or Barnes and noble\nI think just Amazon back as a\nMessage

WC age by being the majority party\nOr in there and and all of this is what Trump I spoke to so eloquently when he called it the swamp is that there is just\nLike this venture capital firm called the federal government you have to give it your money because you're going to prison otherwise and then it gets to play with your money is if it's monopoly game is breaking up is because there's a feeling I think some people don't think it's breaking up fast enough\nOr look Trump was a president who did not take millions of dollars of donations from national interest goes because they didn't need to\nAnd I think that's what set people on edge trade off a the patriotic Americans chair it because they could see that he was starting from a clean slate and what isn't going to enter office beholden to a hundred different interests\nBut a hundred different interests of course\nOr or ticked off because their influence you know from day one and they didn't have an open door to the White House so it might my book actually opens with a chapter about the partisanship of politics and the money in politics and it goes back in time to show that\nYou know our founding fathers never intended our nation to be a politicized bi partisanship they did not even want to set established political parties\nTo when they wanted all the all the candidates to basically when based on people's the people's vote they didn't want just a Republican Party and just the Democratic party and this is where we're at now and this is why there's so much\nMoney in politics because it just is funneled through one of two different systems and you know most of our politicians nowadays are basically bought and paid for\nIs there are ... and this is a theory piece that I throw up to people at cocktail parties taboo thing go Joes a little weird but let's let's start with something simple like removing the guaranteed ballot placement of both political parties\nOr and or indoor guaranteeing anyone who you know just pays the\nSpeed of the boat registrar they get on the ballot like they do kind of a New York state or were you going to have a libertarian and the Green Party and and there's no\nUh there's no guaranteed spot for just the Republican and the Democrat in sort of take that power position in a way where you have to kiss the ring of the party in order to get onto the ballot to get to ... and the first place\nYou know I don't I I I don't see why that is a ... that sounds like a decent I did I may I don't have a problem with that and I also don't have a problem with\nAmericans taking action on their own new real back to the influence of the main parties\nUh you know for instance I suggest stop funding the RMC and the DNC instead take issues that are of concern to you and give your money to those nonprofits I think judicial watched as a tremendous job\nOf letting American people know what's going on behind the scenes in politics and judicial watches a nonprofit so instead of donating to our and see why not give money to judicial watch or if it housing affordable housing as you're saying\nYou know donate money to habitat for humanity ... the idea is let's real back the money going into the political system and lyrical machine and start\nBolstering the amount of money that goes into some of these nonprofits that can actually do the work for the people the little people in America not the political part\nBoth during the amount of money that goes into some of these nonprofits that can actually do the work for the people the little people in America not the political parties\nI Love what you're saying because so often I feel like it's certainly the left but I think there's a lot of Republicans as well who feel like OK I voted for the right person I'm done here I can go back home are and and that's not\nYou know if if a candidate for office says I Want to help women and you vote for them well that doesn't really view of the need to maybe volunteer for a sexual assault agency or something like that uh we you know we can't vote for our good community services uh we have to do them ourselves that's a great\nA great idea for that and and take all that money away from because that is the power a base of it and and as you mentioned Trump really kind of came in around the outside\nOf that ... ... what do you make of the fact that in the last couple of weeks we've seen a lot of democratic candidates laughable having two two one two or three to one advantages over their Republican opponents in fundraising all of a sudden say when we need comprehensive\n... election reform and the and the campaign finance reform I worry that we're going into a place where we're going to federalize or elections and in the government will determine who are candidates are and how much money they get a is that a danger because I feel like conservatives are kind of be pushed that way as well\nUm is terrible well they should go and look at all of the hospitals in Canada because they're they're not well maintained as I say the equipment is old\nAnd the unions are in charge I mean you know the sci you here in America is on is one of the big union says\nPushing for Medicare for all the health workers in Canada I mean they really control you know the health care they get the big salaries they withdraw services the same thing would happen in this country if we got Medicare for all\nWell why do doctors seemed to be in favor of this they they would be turned into nothing more than a ... they might make a little bit more than a nurse but doctors and nurses are going to take the biggest hit of all\nWell you're absolutely right I mean I think in a Senator Sanders bill um SP Eighteen over for you know ... doctors would be paid rates tied to Medicare rates so that would mean that doctors would be paid thirty to forty percent below what they're paid for treating\nPatients today and that means of course many doctors many more doctors would actually retire early for medicine move on to other careers and the best and brightest would not would not go into medicine the American association of\nUh the American association of medical colleges just came out and projected a couple of months ago that the shortage um for doctors by twenty thirty would be a hundred and Twenty one thousand only ... percent up\nOver what they said a year ago and that's because of all this push for single payer I just one quick thing I noted that they knew president at the American Medical Association or a female\nI'm a college us from Santa Fe that came up and said that if it Medicare for all came in she would have to close her oncology practice in Santa Fe because she could no longer afford to run her clinic\nSort of tells you everything you need to know and a ... and again you you're going to find you know it'll be a boon for a hostile hospice care because a lot of people will be told sorry you can't get treatment for that or you're too old to get treatment for that or\nAre there is not enough time for you to earn back your money in tax generations or anything like that us who you're gonna find more people in their fifties and sixties\nOr being pushed into hospice care for chronic ailments like cancer and and diabetes and things like that they're going to be a denied service because uh they're not young enough to ... back out for the society a and all these things that are no good constitutional\nOr ... they seem to think they can\nBuy their way around constitutional prohibitions Sally\nIt well I mean what you say is exactly right and if you look at the media coverage I'm In Canada and the u._k. candidates the only country in the developed world that has a true single payer system I all private coverage is outlawed\nGreat Britain under the national health service which just turned Seventy this past summer\nThey allow private coverage to run parallel in about ten percent of Brett I'm have private coverage and they use it when they think they need an MRI or they need cancer surgery but what you read and the press is about bad blocking so there are a lot of elderly people\nThey need an MRI or they need cancer surgery\nBut what you read in the press is about\nBad blocking so there are a lot of elderly people in Canada any okay who have nowhere to go and so\nThey stay in the hospital beds and keep the people that need actual surgeries out of out of the bed so they're blocking beds and blocking people who really need treatment surgery and treatment after I'm getting into into the hospital\nWhen I first heard and I saw emails from Mark Warner promoting Tim Kaine and and ah bring you back healthcare I said gosh of they really run out of anything else to use against President Trump and and the Republicans are there circling back around to this classic from two thousand and they\nAre goal it older youths healthcare but it it it it's a winning argument because it's the or rather gold is so many voters or what would you do if it is a big goal ... boss the word gifts\nOr if something happened to you what would you do where would you turn you lose all your savings and it's all based on this hypothetical fear mongering um but but we obviously works because they've circled back around to it as a campaign idea\nRight and and so in health care or as you know is the number one issue I'm On the minds of voters in this election coming on November six\nAnd um the other thing is that you know the ... the recent Reuters itself poll showed that I'm Seventy percent of people polled supported Medicare for all and about eighty eighty percent of the Democrats than they pulled supported it but you know as I say I mean it how how\nMuch is going to cost what how is it going to be paid for and people don't realize they just think oh that sounds great I'm going to have something for free and I'll have the very best care and access to care\nUm that that I Would ever want and they don't realize that in a country like Canada where the average wait last year from seeing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialist was over five months Twenty one point\nTwo weeks ago the American people are here with my mom used to say are becoming one of those impatient Americans but it's true that they just wouldn't\nPut up with ration care and the fact they have to wait and Bernice plan says that there would be no referrals to specialists well that's one of the way the government controls cost for example in Canada you have to see a primary care general practitioner ... before you\nCan actually go to a specialist so if he Bernie says\nThere'll be no referrals mean specialist would just be overrun with patients and their salaries there than what they get paid would be much lower and therefore this is going to be another way to push dogs out of the practice of medicine and the shortage would be even worse for for us because we wouldn't be able to get access to care\nDoctor will Sunday on tennis therapy some

B. dot com [noise]\nSally types of research Institute's a year we were\nTold that we Obamacare and you and I talked about it [noise] gosh going on ten years ago now that Obamacare was going to be used to collapse the insurance system a sure enough of insurance companies started leaving as soon as the individual\nMandate or the other hand so then you your left leg in central Virginia with five hundred percent increases because there was only one insurance company left\nA ... and forcing people to a cover things that they wouldn't normally cover a creates an assigned risk kind of pool but you're going to have to throw people in the skin to raise costs as well and it's collapsing the insurance industry from the inside just as you said it would\nUm and and I'm afraid that we're going to be left to this and and no other choice no matter\nRight well you know I mean when Obamacare um turned\nA let's say twenty eight tended to eight years old on march twenty third\nOf this year and it was interesting you know I always felt and I think you and I agreed to do that his whole idea was Obamacare um would not work at the the individual the bench the exchanges wouldn't work and therefore we tried\nYou know the private we've tried competition and therefore now we need to go to Medicare for all or a single payer and interestingly a President Trump a couple of weeks it all came out and said in the u._s._a. today op ed that he was against single payer this country could not afford it\nGoing back before he was president he thought it might be a model so I was very excited that he actually realize it would be too expensive and would deny care President Obama\nWho when he was a state senator and Illinois was a proponent of single payer then when he became president and Obamacare came into being he said well he didn't support single payer\nBecause the American people love their employer based coverage and that is true they do\nAnd now he came out I'm just a couple of weeks ago I think on September seventh saying the Democrats have a whole lot of new ideas out there including single payer so he's been for it before he was the gates that now he's forward again um it's really sort of interesting how this all you know kind of it has you know unfolded\nYou know a way to young people you know are into pot listening to pod cast ... this is our our um while I'm On there\nAnd it was the best way to do with that and I think it's much more direct and I think the president during his campaign and during this midterm the speed of events is showing that that ah you know we can do this hand to hand we don't need to just wait for the\n... news to produce on their ... and nor do we have to buy expensive TV ads to get the message out there uh either\n... by ... we got two minutes left ... what is the next two years look like well\nIf I'm right and as I say most people say I'm wrong if the Republicans hold the house to keep the Senate and or expand the number of senators I think it's it's in their interest to get rid of Obamacare because if not it could come back in the end and the thing [noise]\nThe Mars more than ... than twelve sixty some of these three am FM you're

standard on a daily basis and give us the best chance we can\nTo go out there and perform and um you know and get ready for the Boston College which is going to be another tremendous channels obviously you talk to the team about sticking together after the game you talked about at the press conference are more important now than ever how hard is to get that message across to some of those younger guys I Know the veterans probably get it more so\nWell I I don't sense that that's an issue for us right now I mean we we still have a long way to go we have a ... a lot in front of us to prepare for and try to play and try and\nImprove on I ... and when I ... a ... weeks ago that our mission should be trying to improve like was put the you know all this other talk away unless focus on those getting better and being the best we can be in that shouldn't change and that that hasn't changed and\nYou know there's no reason for us to deviate off that that course and you know we're ... we're still have a lot of football\nLeft to play in a lot of opportunities for us to\nContinue to improve and I liken it to when you play on the road and you know you're playing in a tight ball game and the other team scores and it sounds like you're down by twenty points but you're really not really right in the middle of the game and that's where we're at right now in our season it sounds like we're down by forty points bull really right in the middle of the game or in the third quarter an hour\nOr in a we're in a bare knuckle brawl I mean it's hard and it's tough and you know we're gonna have to to have an extra dose of discipline and toughness and dedication to get through it but um you know there's there's so much more or less for this team and this program to in in my message to the coaches\nYou're setting the standard for which\nI'm these guys are going to play with for years to come you know for you know you get there six guys out there on the field but will be with this next year so we're setting the standard of preparation and workload for years down the road as well not to say that we're not playing for now we absolutely one hundred percent or where I mean I Want Ricky walk her to get everything\nThat he deserves and and we should all\nGo through you're seeing the day to day improvement and I know you've talked to us about the fact that you have from\nSpring ball the way into all Hampton now but you go out and you have weeks where it's not the outcome you're looking for on the field how difficult it is it's a picket back up where you were the practice before you went into that game and say okay it's okay it didn't work out as we hoped but this is the level where we work and let's now go up\nWell it's just not a and I've been through this before guys like I I've just I've been through it as an assistant I've been through it as a head coach it's just not a steady ascent it's not it's not a consistent say if you looked at\nAnd I'm not an expert on this stuff but if you looked at the stock market over the last hundred years you know it it goes up but if you look focus in on one particular day it's all over the place and that's\nWhere we're at a program or we're our job is to make sure we have a steady inclined but in the in the micro there's certainly fluctuations in in how how we go and you know that's that's got to be continuing um focus

things like I'm not asking you to um you know pull off a miracle here like\nYou know you guys are all good enough to occasionally make really really great play is what I Want you to do is make 'em you know the routine plays on a very very consistent basis and\nUm we did that at times and then when we we didn't do that we couldn't overcome that you know some teams are so talented that they could overcome those\nImmediately and we were not there um yeah so um I think I heard him quite honestly to see those things because um they knew there was plenty of opportunity out there for them\nTo keep us in the game you know and I don't know how it would have all turned out that I Would have liked to have seen you know if we could have\nUm executed like we did the first three Sears the\nWay Steve and people started out was pretty remarkable he was playing really really well and then I guess the game plan kinda dictated later that he couldn't get as many carries and whatnot we've seen that before it almost back going back to remind me a little bit of a belt or remember the first half a second half that game\nBut you but you talked about shutting the excuse like shutting the valve off on execution wise and those expected outcomes didn't quite happen\nYeah well first of all Steven is playing at a higher level I mean he's a probably the best player out there right now for us I'm just really proud of him and happy to see him\nHaving success I mean he's good out of the backfield catching a ball he obviously runs hard um you know he's really playing well and we do want to continue to getting the ball and in in a multitude of ways I continue to throwing the football he's got a receiver skills\nUm and you're right the game as it went on it became less there's this less opportunity for him to run the ball a up inside but um you know I think the important message to even Steven is look Steven here's here's one play that we could have executed a little bit better too and that's what\nYou know it's it's shared across the opposition groups there's no one person there is no one\nNo one's not Ryan it's not just the receivers it's not just Italian but it's shared across the group\nAnd you know they've got to understand how to get to that point and the way you do that\nAs you make yourself do it in practice every single time and you can't have those laws and I'm getting them to that confident point and that discipline that level of discipline that they can go do that on a consistent basis um is coming quite honestly I feel good about the progress\nUh when I look back and watch us play last year well\nNot just on that side of the ball I've I feel good about the progress or making\nI think Mike and I talked about that on the broadcast actually with that confidence

shuffle guys through there until we find a guy that can do what we're asking them to do and I'm not picking on charter are Damon or anybody else has been back there you know CJ you know it's not coming back and\nUm you know so we've got to find somebody and will continue to move through there will move through it again this week and ... and continue to to put somebody back there that could both communicate and handle the football to give our our team a chance to have success\nTalking about kickoff return the cliche but that was kind of funny how they kicked away but ... police and people's kind of had some success returning to kick off which is good well I feel good about that unit you know they kicked it all over the place where we knew going into the game\nThat they weren't going to let us just lined up and tell us where they're going to kick the ball and let us go to your phone cars that groups getting better starting to scare people\nAnd but we didn't know what they were going to do you know like it's one thing to know that you're going to get something different is another thing to know what that is and so that they did is they decided to wind up in the first week of the game the kids are all the way across the field\nAnd then the next year they kicked it back to the other side so they're kicking them all over the place and we finally got a bead on\nDetermining where the ball was going to go so you can see our guys trying to check it on the field as we are trying to get it done and they held it really well for a bunch of a bunch of young guys\nUm but I like our return or the like the way our guys\nWe need to be a little bit more physical in the back and I'm not just thrilled with that but our front line which is the really the hardest job a blocking people one on one in space and tackling in space of two hardest things to do it in college football and\nWe're doing a much better job of that and I like I liked that group I Hope that
