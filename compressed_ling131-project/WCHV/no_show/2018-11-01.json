from the commercial break we have introductions that have music in them and we pay fees to use those pieces of music\nAnd the folks who create the music if we pay the fee we can use whatever music we wanted licensed by the major licensing agencies well you know that a lot of politicians use music as well\nUh you know that the you know the Clintons are identified with certain songs in bronco bomb of certain songs well\nApparently for el Williams is not very happy that his song happy is being used by President Trump or music at his rallies and he'd like to stop him I wanted to talk to Tom cooler who's an intellectual property in technology attorney Tom welcome to the program how are you\nI'm very good Lars thanks for having me\nNow I Am glad to have you and I I can tell you that this isn't the first time this has come up in regards to politicians when you hear a rock and roll band that say it says we don't like it when so and so uses our music ... been going on as long as I've been in the business\nBut yes you know what what do you think about the idea that that that uh the musicians want to retain the right to say I don't want that music used with a particular politician that I find distasteful what do you make of that\n... well it's it's really interesting especially and divided political climate that we have now we're seeing more of this in fact we saw this happen with\nNeil Young who was I was a Bernie Sanders supporter and his objection to the use of rock and in the free will like Trump who actually turned around and said listen if you don't want to use it that's fine and we were happy not to do\nDo that and you turn around and said I Wish you would have asked me because even on the Sanders supporter I would've allowed you to use it very interesting take there but you're right this has happened for a while and what we're seeing is a move by the artists themselves outside of the copyright license\nTo assert what is essentially state fall slight claims for federal false endorsed claims under the trademark at ... they're trying to say that by the use of their song in their celebrity there somehow communicating some type of sponsorship\nAffiliation or endorsements buys them of the Kennedy that's using their music I think that tort stemming from and so you're seeing more and more of these things happen it has happened for a while John McCain ran into problems with this of course a himself a Sarah Palin did in ... and you said this herself or even\nObama rented barracuda this exactly so you know and you so\nMuch time tell me this if they were to pay the fees and say we pay BMI and ask cap and there are two other majors that I Can't remember a we pay the fees will use that if we choose to you're saying that under the folds light or you you could actually make the case it'd be it'd be like a\nI don't know if you if somebody caught a picture of me standing next to a product and then they began to use that there might be a above a copyright issue but there'll be an issue of you saying\nYou're saying that I'm endorsing this and I haven't endorsed it and and you can't do that without my permission and and that they would be able to do that even if the politician paid the licensing fee\nYes there's the color will claim and it's under different things one is as I talked about what we kind of encompassing the right of publicity under state law in which case there's an appropriation of in this case the artist named likely\nLikeness or other value associated with it they're trance posing that to their identity with the music itself and that they can identify route from the music itself and that there were some benefit that's a achieved\nThrough the use of that by the campaign and if they color will claim of the elements for right of publicity the one that I see that it's actually a stronger\nWould be the section ... which is that false uh affiliation sponsorship or ...\nOne that I see that it's actually a stronger would be the section forty three eight claim of the land of act which is that falls a affiliation sponsorship for ... that's an unfair competition area of the trademark act that I've seen ... in cases like\nWell see I wondered about that because you know that on my on my show I've used music group time to time and we don't use that much but we we we have a bunch of things called benchmark so if I'm going to talk about marijuana\nOr you know because I'm not a fan of the drug but it is being legalize in various places and it causes a lot of news stories\nUh we have a you know one took over the line mixed into an introduction and and I I Would imagine that\nA chances are they wouldn't object to that but Peter Paul and Mary might object to my using puff the magic dragon which I Believe is a song about pot in relation to songs about idiots doing stupid things on pot because that would also be\nA ... maybe it's too small change\nTo to object to that but ... isn't music used that way all the time by both disc jockeys an by talk show host to add music to some subjective may relate to it some way\nWell yes I mean what's happening here is this that and then we start talking about um are we using this in the context of parity which is an exception a as part of the fair you stop turned into corporate law are we taking that in in a different direction and you you bring up a good point with\nPeter Paul Mary and the use of that song in fact if I recall correctly I'm\nBack in Ronald Reagan era\nThere was usa ... Bruce Springsteen's born in the u._s._a. and it was being used as like this hey you know rally nationalist anthem when in fact the artist himself Bruce Springsteen was talking about that saying you know this this really is a piece that cuts both ways is about a Vietnam vet coming back\nIn and seeing that it it may not be what you're actually using it for and so it's very very interesting that when we look at the music itself I think campaign should be very very careful\nIn what they're doing and how they're using it because\nI have noticed myself like you watch this for a number of years so I'm In my twenty fifth year of law practice and I've seen these ramp up\nOver the last ten Fifteen Years and I think we ... if I was advising the campaign I Would say play it safe\nReach out to these specific artist in this case for well it's not even under any of the main ones ask at the ... he's under a new one that was formed back in two thousand Thirteen or two thousand fourteen called global uh write a global music rights and that\n... a outfit itself covers rake in others it's pretty clear that the campaign to not have a license that do not seek the permission for al ... used to that song well kind of campaign should be careful\nBut let me ask you something how much latitude you good if you say I'm going to go out as a candidate whether it's president or dog catcher and I'm going to engage in free speech\nAre you allowed to say I'm I'm making some some use of this but it's in consequential to the sales of it in other words you're\nYou know people may here and say oh that's great song I should get a copy of an Irish downloaded but it's and and I guess you could you could have some negative effects from it but does the candidate who is engaging in politics which is covered by the first amendment\nFree assembly and the rest of that does he have any latitude to use it and just say it's fair use\nI think you've got to be careful that's a that's a case by case basis let's look at some of the ones that have been used Newt Gingrich using a I have the tiger from Rocky through on John McCain's use of running on anti with Jackson from by Jackson Browne which in fact he actually settled that case it had to issue an apology\nUm we talked about Ronald Reagan and born in the usa a\nPaul Ryan said we're not going to take it which was a um there was some pushback like twisted sister and rage against the machine or a number of cases here where it seems\nA poll riots you said we're not gonna take it which was a um there was some ... put it back like twisted sister rage against the machine or a number of cases here where it seems very clear that campaign it's using the song because it's spinning Americans for the specific campaign\nRight and I think that's where you need to be careful because now I I from what I can gather the way the wall sits right now although you can make the appropriate defense and trying to say we're using this as free speech ... says parity um depending on its use\nThat as a defense to an action that most certainly would likely be bought by that artist because they don't want to be seen as being affiliated with ... ... what you're seeing more you're seeing more of that with Trump\nTom one last question why we got the time ... does the artists have to show that he's here she is lost out on something ... I've lost sales or or that prove that there is some actual harm to bring the to bring the claim\nWell that's a great question with respect to copyright an a copyright violation no because where you have a registered copyright in place there is no need to prove up damages you can get statutory damages which range anywhere from Seventy five dollars to thirty thousand dollars\nYou know socialism and that's what we're talking about right now I did this to seal is Suzie Suzie sociologist like I don't really know how to call them\nUh the socialist these individuals believed\nIn a system that is just fundamentally unproven and even these iconic individuals Ben and Jerry they say they want to give away all the profits and then when it comes down to it they realize that\nYou know but by and large this not within our human nature we we want to be successful you want to get back and and really the\nActions speak louder than words and nine line apparel yet nine might foundation we build houses for veterans we are creating a community called the veterans village where we take homeless veterans off the street and we help educate them and get them into some sort of employment what I asked\nYou what I asked to Ben and Jerry's is why don't you put your profits\nWhere your mouth is instead of preaching of all these things talking about these things that should be done by someone else and saying that I'm going to donate some of my money\nOut there you know really we're talking about less than one percent of total earnings or why not put some your actions behind it put put a little bit more of that type hind it doomed to others as you want like\nTo be done on to you it's preached in the obviously the books of face a why can't we just adhere to it in the civilian practice\nI'd like to see that happen in fact I think it would have been a lot more fun and a lot more all American Ben and Jerry's\nHad come out with a I don't know some red Trump or you know pink Trump or ice cream and and then the ... the resist stop and say\nJust pick your flavor because in America we going to all the waivers ruined and then been injured almost twice as much dry ice cream because they're showing your both sides I've seen\nSome other retailers sell soft drinks and cans like that and I think snapple even decided to do or red and blue version so that they're heading up to the election you could choose do you choose read or do you choose blue I thought that was much more the attitude that Americans can believe whatever they want to believe\nAnd that we don't stone people to death for their believe like happens in some countries\nAbsolutely so one of the things that I really like to see is the fact that people look at the issues at hand it's not read said it's not lose faith it's the idea that there's issues\nThat need to be discussed it if we can vote along the lines of the issues that we want to be addressed which is what happened this last election\nYou know people were tired of seeing some of the things that we held near and dear to our hearts deteriorate ... and people believe that the current administration was going to make true on their promises it\nIf we can do it alone or our belief systems and and are you know issues and get away from the politics of just voting blindly red and blue then I think this country from state to progress\nTyler

Peter how are you\nI'm doing all out there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood thank you how mad that I got a follow up on all the millionaire if that was just calling in um but I just want to let you know I Am an avid listener and I can't believe I'm finding myself in this situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and found the gate shutting out my vehicle and cracked my relationship\nI tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there was contacted by them required in seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to pay for the gate that closed on my vehicle\nBombs come back and forth conversation with alternately refusing to pay them just because there's no indication of at the gate with close et cetera et cetera I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them and this past week I got a call from a collection agency I'm just wondering if you have some advice from\nHer attorney what's that hire an attorney for seven hundred and Seventy five dollars for the damages yep okay what about do you think that small claims court could be an option yup\nBut I I'm ... and I think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they write them a letter or you may shut this whole thing down I don't know that you don't have to go to small claims court\nOkay and so and I make I mean conversation with the a collection agency cracked it has nothing to do with the apartment complex anymore\nSo yesterday was still on that and they're the ones that hard to collections agency I Would say like I Wish they'd apartment complex\nOkay so I Am in college as well just come back on the part that goes on they you'd think my my next step should be to talk to an attorney and be in contact with the um with the apartment complex and no way could I could write a check for this a collection agency\nIf you think that the gate closed improperly and you weren't doing anything wrong in the stupid thing broke your car they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right right that's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know\nAn an a letter from an attorney may solved the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nOr shall we need to get someone that gets their attention\nBecause basically you're getting run down by a corporate ladder here

they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a a employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you would never spend that much on dentistry\nIt just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us\nThis doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us that is a a dental discount company and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on your dental repairs your dental work and so forth\nAnd um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website one dental is what it's called one dental and er James just helped me

we and we could retire and five years you don't have to [laughter] but we we couldn't be comfortable um what what is it still makes sense to hire\nUm a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they go on a five point five percent of what you're\nActually there looking they're proposing a ... a manager to count for you\nCorrect OK yeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to count approach and on and so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you're going to ... and I'm anytime you're investing in when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart enough to approach okay\nUm and so the\nThere's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront sees\nA that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no\nAnnual after that or they managed to count worries for percentage of the balance every year\nAnd know what are you getting that while they're helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know I Hope over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the S. and P. and of course you've got someone to meet with in cover anytime there's a question about anything\nI'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not ...\nIce and picking a proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one\nWhen we look at I mean I work with you every day you know kind of\nSee how you've got that down there and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so that that part of stuff so you know the thing is just ask them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging\nAnd uh you know 'cause you're charging me of the worst that are in in most cases you'll find it is\nIt that way then you're kind of make more than the cost of the fee\nIn extra returns and certainly in services in terms of uh you know education that's available to you and\nUm you know there's eight thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with eight thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long this comb through those funds\nIt's their whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nOr I could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it\nBut it would take me longer or there'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer hooks up to the guards instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investment so I don't why those either um I don't even do my own taxes\nAre and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural for math and all that kind of stuff but\nI don't why when it gets to the end of the ... the the the\nYou know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the manager to count is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nOkay you the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time and here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and and you know what am I knew one and a half percent more what it costs to half a percent so you'd an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd uh I don't think any smart Mr pro that we have would\nUm tell you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can\nAnd then just asking to show you a\nGood question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd I are you doing today better than I deserve Sarah what's up\nUh I've had a question um maybe a better question for Gary Coleman but about my career uh I'm currently in by with that too and I'm a welder I worked at a town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um\nI've got opportunity to go work at home by the pay is about a third of what am I working out of town and I'm now a curious if you thought it was crazy to take all bought that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nSo you're making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah OK at home um my aunt no where are you are where are you working out of town\nA member going on now but I'm I'm actually been all over the world was on um you know my own have their own market right now I'm On a on\n... and they find out more than a ... file mhm mhm okay\nI think the answer for me would always be see\nMhm and they found out later than a flower mhm okay\nWell I think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ... I I liked the idea of coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out how can I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money\nWhat am I gotta do to make more money off the road or can I Do some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month\nAnd a and go ... out on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until but is there is there a pass a career path at home or whether it's owning your own shop\nOr a you know I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. B. at home\nVersus a road jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be ... the rocks I'm going to be turning over looking for is to how to do that and um you know where I Want to be one I'm forty and will be on the road you don't want to be on the road already told me that getting married I don't blame you get to go there will be home with their wives\nLike good question I think you could figure it out but it's a tough one this was the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAnd\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage\nYou know it works the same as compound interest you know it was a very powerful thing ... um for the single folks out there working on their debt snowball get an accountability partner hanging around people that are have those kinds of positive relationship and influence on you know I'm after that\nIt's focused because now this day and age where social media audience distractions\nUm life happened to us during the ... pay off and I happen to us you know before the end we were in the dating phase any engagement you know for example um before we were married she dealt with depression for several years dealt with the strings of unemployment I had written notice is on my door\nMy rent was only forty five at that time and I have a three straight months\nLate written notice is so it was tough times and then even once we got into the debt snowball\nOr a little bit before that whenever I got my job offer I went through a grant program and it was tough we we do some things that were our fault for example when I got to use cars map pictures of him um we had a bunch of car repairs um\nWe got those cars right before we moved from South Carolina the Houston Mm So you talk about stupid on steroids is pretty much it was shocking they're talented up down after it for even started a job um we had car repairs\nUm we we cast load her university for about two years during this time is when a while so I mean what are your degrees in\nPublic health and violence and you did grad work you said at one\nTime in human resources okay very good\nExcellent careers sharp Koppel you guys are rock stars to touch down\nThe feels great like you know momentum is crazy because\nUm you know are they going bad is if compounds on top of want to know when it's going good has been very good simply pay
