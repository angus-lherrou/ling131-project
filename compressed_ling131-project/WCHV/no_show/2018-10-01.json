just gave everyone pup tents and said a knock yourself out um and they're just now starting to get to a point they don't even have a rescue squad\nThey lost all the gear and everything for the rescue

will be out this Saturday at for the annual Greene County pig grossed up you can join this up there for that we're going to chat with it\nAnd there will be out there Saturday as for the annual Greene County he grows up you can join us up there for that will go to chat with it and show about that but one of the things that brought up was twenty Nineteen\n\nAnd ... why is twenty Nineteen important then how does it come back to him this perjury trap there's three felonies today's society we've lived in well here's\nHere's why and the premise behind the logic behind writing laws like Maryland and Florida's law that says you have to shut off your cell phone if there's police activity anywhere nearby\nIs because they don't want to have the honest forthright conversation of\nA photograph of a police officer engaging in a traffic stop or videotape is only so much in ... um admissible they don't want to have that they don't want to discuss that because that's the\n... writes his way to discuss it they don't want to discuss\nA security camera photo of frozen moment on the security camp is really just an investigative tool and they get really has to be carefully vetted before it can be admissible as evidence of course the laughable thing is we're in a world where you can walk into a fight to court judge and say\nWhy ... job for surveilled Joe Thomas y or Z St Joe Tomei Sendai we think Joe Thomas is guilty of\nBeing a a ... in communication with people who might be on toward a via his radio show\nOh oh okay good chunk you get your ... and ... which were learning if there's a deeper subjects politics be damned\nEither this from collusion\nInvestigation is we've now exposed the fact that these Pfizer court judges are more of a rubber stamp than your average DMV clerk\nAnd this is a scary thing these are the people who are supposed to we were told when the department of homeland security was put together\nOh don't worry it's gonna be a very high bar to get back kind of ... apparently not apparently just you know sign on the FBI go golf we can with the guy I Know him he's a good guy a says if he says Joe Thomas should be surveilled damn good with the could jump\nNext\nSo I get deli counter taken number now serving number forty eight\n\nAnd these things come about because the politicians convince themselves that it's easier to do it this way than to have an honest conversation with the G and then they say oh I don't know why people don't trust the government anymore really\nReally\nAre you at a youth that thick headed\n\nSo in the surveillance state where we commit three felonies today why is twenty Nineteen important because these are the people we have a hundred and forty seats in the Virginia general assembly whether you're humble hosed feels like that number is about a third of the number and should be or not\nIrrelevant we have one hundred and forty seats in the Virginia general assembly these are the people who write these laws\n\nThese are the people who have to give you permission to sell your produce off the farm\n\nI have to give you permission to sell your produce off the farm where\nGo because they you know when they established the Virginia general assembly four hundred years ago next year for four hundred years or a hundred years doesn't look good day over two hundred\n\nFour hundred years ago they just sort of copied over British common law and then two hundred and Thirty years later when we establish the Constitution's they sort of just left it the way it was\nAnd even forty years ago when we started the process of you know tweaking the Virginia ... basically kept all these British common law things like the law of the admiral T that leads to civil asset forfeiture\nThis tendency farmer belief that you first you have to get permission from the Virginia general assembly to sell the produce you grow on the farm you you grew with on\nThat's why twenty Nineteen is important because these are the people who in the middle of the night will write these laws that that we do to committing three felonies today\nYour money you're on the air with Joe Thomas in the morning who's this\nOptimist partly optimist how you doing sir\n[noise] what's on your ... segue election in perfect for me so\n[laughter] I Hope to see you there on Saturday [noise]\nActually I\nHope you're good well we'll have to have some pulled pork for you so what's on your mind than\nWell I'm I was unfortunately able to make it last week when they brought a subject of a\nBerkeley organization and county straighter and\nFollowing up with that with and it ended our hopes transparently and a um [noise] not sound like a truth so again we're back to a\nFew thousand I Love hearing land and a transparency which doesn't exist so\nThat's that's why us but that's why these elections matter and and it can be more dramatic than this process and the only way you'd be it's going to change is if you change the people who are doing it\nI said this to the memorial Charlottesville Republican women's league I mean it's great to sit there and yell at the radio and say why are these people doing what I Want them to do but if if we don't get out and and do something about it if we say\nBob young isn't good enough to be a a supervisor but Michelle Flint is well you get what you get 'em either I was I was in a room with Dwayne snow\nUm who had been for a while uh the representative of a one of the districts here an album our own county great conservative humble quiet gentleman who wasn't good enough for

[noise]\n\n\nSo now here comes Justin Trudeau saying yeah it's a great day for Canada limping slightly 'cause his bought hurts but ... I'm Sorry that was metaphorically speaking has\nBought hurts and it's just the matter of saying fair is fair and in\nA lot of these trade deals none of the war up for renegotiation this\nAnd it's just the matter of saying fair is fair and in a lot of these trade deals none of the war up for renegotiation this year or last year so\nHow'd you get somebody to come back and\nNegotiate you say well what do I have what what tools that my resource do I have that I can get\nJustin Trudeau to come do some pushups on the boardroom table\nHunky prime minister of Canada\nHow can I get both outgoing and

I'm actually just wearing my boots I'm where I'm where you know tennis shoes honestly\nKevin McCarthy a house majority leader Kevin thanks for coming out on the campaign trail with Denver or what are you hoping for for this district obviously you want to keep it in the Republican Party but you're talking about working with Denver for the future of\nBudget cuts tax cuts those kinds of things well I'll tell you the the uniqueness as just meaning Denver you made him one time\nYou almost fall in love with the man because I'm his passion for his district the reason I'm here because Denver told me look I'm going to tell you about my the challenges for this district but I don't want to tell you I Want you to see him\nThat's why we're right here and Sam's that's why we've been out and meeting with people\nYou know the infrastructure that he's concerned about her but the great thing about Denver it's not that he's just talking to Republicans as independents and Democrats it's all because they're joining together that we're all Americans but he looks at the challenges we've got to balance our budget right\nWe've got to grow this economy he knows from being a small business owner he knows about the military haven't been in the military and working with DOD\nTo have a statesman like that willing to serve the public service in this climate is probably one of the best things we've had going for us but he's going to hit the ... he'll hit the ground running on day one\nBecause uh what he's been out listening throughout the entire district he knows what has to get achieved because he's willing to listen but have the courage to lead at the same time and what I like about it and he says I got to come down here and see it first hand so now he just made a believer in me to actually help him so he won't be just by himself\nOr you are you know one of those novelties we should have you in some sort of display a Republican from California but you know California like Pennsylvania like Michigan a whole lot more conservative than necessarily\nPick a party and choose but Denver who's going to represent a you know if he wins an area like Charlottesville which has certainly a reputation of being left leaning I'm Talking about speaking conservative principles\nTo somebody beyond political party membership\nFirst thing I Want to do you want to be honest ethical and you want to be willing to listen those are all the traits that I see in Denver yeah we're in Charlottesville is not going to be a bastion of Republican but he's gonna represented as well so he's here listening he brought me here to listen to see what the challenges are\nAnd yes we have our principles and our philosophy\nBut there are so much we can do for this country the respect that we give to one another much different than what we've seen in the last week in those hearings in the Senate\nMain what those senator Democrat senators did to Dr Ford is wrong and be able to hold to put her through what they put her through and I think the country is looking for something more and I think it's so refreshing when\nYou sit and talk to Denver you're ... you're not going to get a political answer you're going to get directly what he sees in what he feels it doesn't matter where you come from and that's the type of person that I think will help to turn this country around where\nYou brought up the hearings and certainly the way we started to use politics of personal destruction here in Charlottesville you know you you guys are at a business that unfortunately might find themselves targeted a we've seen people marching people targeting businesses people targeting individuals\nFor their you know their belief in a ... particular\nPolitical party or a vote this you're shouting screaming that Denver just saw the debate the other night [noise] um you know when does the yelling and and does that yelling actually helped the Republicans of the Gallup poll we were talking about before the interview were more people are saying they have a favorable view of Republicans middle class families have a favorable\nThe Republicans of the Gallup poll we were talking about before the interview were more people are saying they have a favorable view of Republicans middle class families have a favorable view view of Republicans do you think some of that has to do with the hair on fire jumping around name calling politics of personal destruction\nI think it really has to do with results versus resistance thank for a moment where we are economically were probably in one of our best positions as a country as we've been in the last fifty years I mean unemployment in the last forty nine years has only been below four percent nine months in forty nine years\nBut for those nine months we just lived through but not one Democrat even though I had a lot of them tell me they wanted to vote for it but Nancy Pelosi would not let them now one Democrat in the house or Senate voted for it they just wanted to resist instead of find the results and that's a real challenge\nSo so where does the house go say no twenty\nNineteen begins and you've got a house majority whip Denver Riggleman representing the fifth district what you're obviously one of the things are going to be a leadership\nVote with Paul Ryan stepping down um you you are one of the candidates if I'm not mistaken for speaker of the house what was what the speaker Kevin McCarthy want to get done or if you get to serve as speaker of the house well\nThe first thing that has happened is you gotta stand the majority to make sure Republican can be a speaker I'm history is against us on since World War two only two times at the party in power I mean those are capture the White House gain seats in off year ...\nMost of the time they lose thirty two on average we only have a twenty three seat majority so my entire focus is on making sure we maintain that majority going across the country which I'm doing\nUm when that elections over will have the debate within the conferences you where we go but it's pretty uniform of what we want to be able to accomplish we still got to solve our healthcare crisis which would that will do we've got a challenge we gotta protect Social Security and Medicare\nOr the Democrats have a proposal to end Medicare as we know it you're healthcare if you get fifty five percent American gets it from um their employer that will no longer be an option but the Democrats then you look what they want to do with ice\nThey want to eliminate ice and they voted not just last week I put a bill on the floor because what's happening in these Democrat controlled cities there are a lot of their allowing illegals to vote\nYou know I Know that disenfranchise is every legal citizen\nThose who are naturalized citizen the most exciting moment if you've ever been to a naturalization is they register to vote the first time they will just able to vote 'em the Democrats voted against the resolution saying denouncing having illegals vote so that's a real concern if their agenda is about dismantling ice\nThey want to end Medicare as we know it Medicare for all and then their top item is impeaching the president they actually voted on it twice already Tom Steyer this given him a hundred and thirty million dollars brags that his impeachment list is bigger than the ... that's what their agendas

turning this country around the other thing that people don't quite grasp is he has a plan\nIf you look what he's doing what trade that he's bringing a Canada and Mexico together when people thought think about what he's done with North Korea\nHere was North Korea two years ago testing nuclear weapons\nThey just had the parade know ICBMs and they no longer test he has changed and made the world a little safer you look at the region in the middle east they're safer today based upon his decisions within the middle east I think America is coming back this is the America's great comeback\nEconomically we've got to balance our budget now we've got to get into a situation that the next century as ours today America produces more\nPhenomenally we've got to balance our budget now we've got to get into a situation that the next century as ours today\nAmerica produces more energy than Saudi Arabia or Russia we have now surpass them because we change it led to export you look what we've done with the VA system the choice that bad employees are now able to be fired some good employees can rise up the GI Bill how we treat our senior how we treat our servicemen and women right\nHe used to be Fifteen Years or you'll often now it's for a lifetime\nBut think about what we just passed on opioids the most comprehensive\nBill ever on opioids just this week or what about human trafficking\nModern day slavery more than a hundred thousand people\nGet traffic every year in Seventy percent of that happens on line do you realize we have now shut that down these are things that we continue to work on but we have so much more and that's why we need Denver for\nA moment a person has served in the military person worked a DOD a small business owner that took a risk made an investment had to battle to get there with regulation he knows what people are facing today and what's most important about a\nMan who's willing to listen to all people\nAnd tell them his position in an honest approach and go solve the problem we were fortunate to have Denver running\nYou know Denver we said this uh you know when the president talked about no no tariffs at all and I said when was the last time we figured you'd ever hear of president talk about a world with no tariffs at all I said it could be the argument could be made and boy I made my libertarian friends mad that\nDonald Trump could be the first truly libertarian thinking president out there but you're you're you're a got a little libertarian streak running down a little bit a little bit down my bag yeah I Would I mean it's amazing\nWhat we're what we're seeing right now and that's what and the leader coming here today is just such an honor because uh he pretty much knew the first week after my conventional engine second I walked up there and met them\nOn Capitol Hill that I was going to need some assistance or with a learning curve because it's moving straight up so there's this guy the first day I walked in there he he he actually he greeted me so what do you need help with and I cannot believe that we have the majority leader here in the fifth district and he was on that come down and now he said it was very kind words I'm much I don't think he made up by the way\nI think they were true I think too I did was holding ... yards yeah yeah that's right do they weren't moving though it was a he has a ear bud in but um but uh\nYou know what what we've seen right here in our district unemployment is down\nUm it's down one full percent it's almost a matching a national trend what'd you say too is you have an average family incomes coming up but we have such a labor shortage in the district\nBut we were talking about me and the leaders how do we address that right so when we talk about legal immigration yes we want to secure border we're talking about how do we address a labor issues in the fifth\nDistrict but also the opioid crisis that he referred to but also our infrastructure issues so it's just such an eye opener to me um to have somebody you know like the leader come down to ah to assist in helping me get through some of these issues\nAnd and healthcare Kevin brought it up a ... that this is going to be one of those issues that they'll run around and\nThey'll come out we saw that the debate friday night at UVA you know they're saying you've taken away our health care which you haven't done that I I don't think it was me personally and well but I you know in general talk about addressing things here in Virginia we now have the ability to you know get into direct\nPrimary care associations things like that what about health savings accounts things like that or you know those things you want to kind of you know your\nHead yes you I mean for H. essays you know I'm a big fan of ... H. S. age but I'm also a big fan of portability of healthcare right and when you start doing a research and sadly I read a lot but I also have a business right I have\nI have people who need insurance so I deal with it all the time you know I signed both sides of the checks and I do all the insurance sort of negotiation for a company on what you see is if you actually get to\nAnd so I deal with it all the time you know I signed both sides of the checks and I do all the insurance or negotiation for a company on what you see is if you actually get a third party out if you get your second party payment which is direct payment payment had more transparency in the house so somebody would help business owners and what you see right now is that when people say Medicare\nFor all that is the same kind of sort of issue at the same kind of um way forward that the VA had to go through\nSo when the leader talks about there being choice bill right it's not only foreign bad people but it's giving our veterans choice in our health care what does that mean we're increasing competition out of a government system that was broke so for me looking down both sides I think we can have some basic protections but we have to look at introducing the free market I think we're seeing that here I think\nWhat is it a we have the anthem coming in here to go up against optimal because of their bathrooms\nBack you know back when he was do you bring up beds choice and we've had some problems with folks who are you know again just like government bureaucracy they've used by choice and it's taken a long time to get payments so there's still fixes that need to be made so when you say it ah I Know some of my veterans in the audience will say hold it I'm not you know there's still work to be done\nAnd I even know one of 'em you know big John writings and Dan Marino choice was just the beginning but I think oh I think what the leader was referring to is that when you have people that are coming in that no the district in the business sort of line that's going on here and they have to deal with it every day\nI sort of have an idea of what's needed and that's why I'm so so excited you know to to get into Congress because it's going to happen and I'm so excited that I have the actually the face some support or somebody like you know Kevin McCarthy that's that's no small thing\nWell thank you both for coming Kevin thanks for coming to Charlottesville is this your first visit no I've been here many times but um ... no no I'm\nCal State Bakersfield hard [laughter] it's

congressional candidates\nEven helping oh well it's been fantastic and um but we know we have a battle on our hands but this election is going to be about results versus resistance and it's a fundamental difference if we're able to keep the majority\nUm I think well see the next century will be ours\nUh if we wake up in November seventh and the Democrats have taken a majority what you watch last week in the Senate is only the beginning the chaos the numbers of hearings that you have it won't be talking about infrastructure for the fifth district of Virginia there'll be just

next voice you hear as that of guy Williams who is uh in the studio with us this morning to talk about a sheriff's department and the ... program but not the one you think of good morning guy how you doing sir\nI Know it's going to sound a little bit confusing but oh no no no we're pleased to be kicking off ah restarting the Augusta county sheriff's office a foundation and it's going to be yes a golf fundraiser a this has supported a very much by a share of partying and chief deputy Brian\n[noise] for filing the county's model and the bottles been very successful in you know here in Charlottesville\nThey're more county has worked very well so we're having a verse fund raiser on October the Nineteen at the club that the iron would er which is near the holiday inn and Stan\nGuy you're working with sheriff's Smith and no not that sheriff Smith a service Smith of Augusta ... who's also here with us this morning show Smith talk about you know the ... program you know certainly I remember the first time I met ... partying he was still up\nIt sure Smith talk about\nYou know the ... program you know certainly I remember the first time I met ... party and he was still at Charlottesville policemen are at the time and it was explaining what he wanted to do with this and I'm like yeah okay sure I get it and he did everything he said he wanted to do and then some with it I'm Talking about the impact of an oak silvery\nProgram for a a sheriff's department like Augusta county uh it's very important for us the men and women that are in our share some of his family there the\nCalls for service or steadily increasing\nAnd things are becoming extremely busy ... and being able to put reserves in the cars with the men and women that patrol Augusta county's huge um it gives them a sense of security gives him somebody else to be out there on the calls with them\nAnd it's um good for everybody involved because the community can see what we do on a daily basis and they can\nBe involved in what we do and get back to the community as well\nWell and for both sides of the coin because if you're interacting with law enforcement then there's two law enforcement officers there then it stops me your word against there's you know it's from both sides of the fence I think ... you know when you have multiple\nUh interactions but also you know some of the things that you're able to do search and rescue certainly in this area one of the most impactful spots or that the chips\nAuxiliary I presume if this is a guy guy Williams is involved\nIn it you know first off kind of call me before you make the decision not on the old guy here in Illinois ... but but that's that's the kind of stuff that that\nCommunity engagement you know when you know when everyone's nerves or our last and hurricanes you know flooding that kinda thing is got to be a big part of this as well\nWell my vision is to help every division in the sheriff's office school resource courts\nUm everything from search and rescue anything that the sheriff's office involved in\nUm I Want to get the reserves to be able to help us so we're trying to get the program started um we had eight years ago and had to stop it because of budget issues um but we're off to a good start and I just want to keep the program building and move forward\nNow you're going to do a golf fundraiser a for it and it's going to be to the club\nIn iron ... it's a little bit on what used to be the same country flooded pull that are in would it's a write off a that he won\nA near the holiday inn and this fund raiser will be\nThe only funding really necessary to for this program we hope this will be a non funded program from the county it will be sustainable and it will be something that can again or build on I'm certainly for the safety of the officers that are out there\nAnd I think that the taxpayers in the oil as soon as we have in Augusta county ad that do here is\nA ... willpower I found that went on the air or they're instance somewhere\nAh but the spread the word on line if you are listening as well um that you you're talking about self sustaining that's such an important part of this as well because you are one of the reasons I'm a big fan of our constitutional law enforcement is is you know the you're you're somebody that the voters had to vote for sheriff Smith they know you\nThey trust you and you want to make sure that the that you're a ... worthy of that trust\nCorrect uh trust is a very important part and the community\nUh looks to me to make the right decisions and I think that increasing our readiness and being able to protect the public um a lot of times when we deal with when we interact with them that's the worst day of their life and um we try very hard to you\nPublic um a lot of times when we deal with when we interact with them that's the worst and their life and um we try very hard to make a difference with everybody that we\nCross so guy a way it is the golf tournaments or how good of a golfer ... ... you know\nA chef Smith uh unfortunately doesn't golf well actually that's that's the only fair share of hurting doesn't either he's running around making sure everyone else is having a good time and and share Smith will do the same\nThing so we're very happy to have the and we appreciate the globe at our in would on October the nineteenth

E. O. C. K. E. restaurant\nIn Port by President Trump's first nominee to head U.S Department of labor the author most recently of the capitalist come back to the Trump boom and the ... plot to stop it any good to have you back on the program\nBut Richard Gere large thank you\nSo I Know people are trying to make a a an old village people song of us MCA but or is this a better deal for us the NAFTA was\nBush's uh this is a much much better deal for us for particularly for America workers than out there was\nA the Mexico part of it is huge for people in the automotive sector by requiring that more\nMore a larger percentage of cars being manufactured in North America to take advantage of the other no terrorists or that that a nap to use to supply that the u._s. MCAA now now supplies farmers I'm going to benefit from it a project\nA particular up in Wisconsin with a more dairy being able to were not more able to export more dairy into Canada which they had big restrictions on that before this even you know the wine growers in in liberal California are going to have an eastern time selling wine in British Columbia\nAnd the NFL which hasn't exactly been a big fan of Donald Trump's up to now is going to be able to uh sell advertising in Canada which it previously prior to disagreement the NFL could only show ads that it had shown in the United states and Canada so lost a big revenue opportunity that's not going to be gone they're going to be able to make money up there so\nIt's really a benefit for a broad swath of the American business community and in American workers\nSandy we're going to have more than a most most of the nail ads running in in during NFL games or something along those lines\nOr didn't surprise me at all I mean if the games are popular up there I'm sure that uh the uh the the the products that are most popular with Canadians will not want to buy\nAt space or during NFL games and that's a that's a benefit to the NFL I said this was this was a deal that cut across political lines so and in Mexico the unions loved the deal and Mexico because it's requiring\nThat I think it's twenty five percent of every car be built by people that are making at least sixteen dollars an hour and it opened up\nThe um opportunities for Mexicans to unionize so this is a I I I you know nobody should be criticized industrial this as a great deal that it meets a commitment that President Trump made that certainly absolutely shows\nAs many of us have been saying that\nHe wasn't trying to impose terrorists to destroy free trade\nHe was trying to make a make a trade free or by making it fairer and in this deal does\nThat look in the in the ... part of the afternoon of Monday right after the deal's been done they said the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place you'd expect those to go away or at least to be substantially modified or is there a reason they're still in place and they didn't go away automatically when this was done\nI I wouldn't be surprised if ah if there were some exceptions made for Canadian steel\nObviously Canada doesn't doesn't uh pose a national security threat to the United states now there may be some qualifications put in that with respect to whether or not they could sell steal that they imported as opposed to steal their manufacturing in Canada but I wouldn't be surprised to see that but\nThis agreement does not contemplate that a candidate was in a quarter in negotiating disagreement and uh I think the president got just about everything he wanted a from the Canadians and from the Mexicans as well our interest answering a strong negotiating position something that\nI don't think other presidents either perceived or we're willing to take the risk the political risks of abusing the power they have in these negotiations\nI'm Talking to Andy ... who's who was the first nominee to head the U.S department of labor\nAnd author of the capital's comeback can you talk at all about the increased intellectual property protections in this because as I understand that's one of those details that may not be sexy to people but but it's tremendously important when it comes to dealing not only with our allies like Mexico and Canada\nBut dealing with some real antagonistic folks like the Chinese\nWell it's it's it it was important with respect to Mexico and Canada we always want to make sure that our intellectual property is protected as well outside the United states as it is inside the United states but with Canada and Mexico that wasn't as big a problem with Canada and Mexico I think the bigger deal was updating\nA the IT laws when it came to to digital sales are things that have developed since the early Nineteen nineties out when when after was originally passed with China this is a huge issue China does everything it possibly can to steal American technology I'm done that it's on that\nMany many years there was a study by an independent commission here in the United states a congressional commission or that determined that they've done everything they can espionage wise and or outright theft wise to seal or intellectual property we did\nThe company I used to run did business in China even a fast food restaurant company like ours to open franchise restaurants in\nAnd say in Shanghai we had to get\nA Chinese partner and you know you have a partner there they're exposed to everything you know no we didn't have a big trade secrets that the Chinese would have wanted but any kind of any company that went into trying to had to bring in\nA Chinese partners and often was required to disclose intellectual property I'm just to do business in China which is grossly unfair and one of the things that I Am absolutely confident after the election\nOf President Trump will be able to resolve I don't think we're going to see any progress with Europe and China pending the election because there's no upside for China in Europe to negotiate a deal before the election they think the president may may lose some power\nAfter the election if the Republicans are unable to hold the house are unable to hold the Senate and if they canceled either one of them he is going to be spending more time arguing with a\nWith the Democrats about impeachment than he is negotiating better trade deals which would be a tragedy for the United states in American workers so I'm hoping Republicans will stay in power and then after the election I think will get better trade deals\nYou know you would think this is one of those things that Democrats and Republicans from time to time also loses a bipartisan issue like national security is bipartisan but the different sides see different solutions to different problems\nWhy do you suppose it is that Republicans are so much more concerned about say protecting things like intellectual property then the Democrats seem to be because it does happen a dramatic effect on uh on on jobs I remember there was one company that had it's a software technology\nFor controllers for windmills ripped off and they had a thousand people working for them in the United states and they almost one out of business so to mental actual property could've been a thousand people in the bricks that that should be something that transcends ideological barriers in the United states shouldn't it\n... it it should and to some extent it does we had Chuck Schumer um and and Elizabeth Warren both actually I have been somewhat supportive of the president on this and make a warrant told CNN\nThat she thought President Trump putting terrorists on the table with respect to China was a good idea and should be part of the trade policy\nA short trimmer was very outright but he said China takes total advantage of the United states steel some real actual property using ... cyber theft to use\nThe ... they are more aligned with President Trump on this issue than they are with others but I I tell you what I can uh\nI'd be very surprised if either of them had anything good to say about anything he negotiates I'm sure they look for whatever vulnerability they could find in the agreement because\nWe're we're to the point where anything that President Trump wants to do even if it's things that show him or an warrant and other Democrats support they are going to criticize it just because it's President Trump\nA ... which is one of the reasons rapping such a hard time moving forward in this country with things that have to go through Congress the president as soon as you would be getting a lot done despite that opposition so I I think we'll see continued progress\nYou know Andy uh do you think on an entirely different matter in the last thirty seconds to got are we going to have a nine Supreme Court justice by the end of the week\nI I think we are in last year I when I was up for secretary of labor law stuck Collins and Murkowski over lanes that life that my former wife had made that she admitted were not true she it but I still wash them ... you never know you never know how those two are going to vote 'em and\nYou know that was required to pass the testing a fraud to get all those degrees you can't remember jak but\nShe ... she and she can't or the specifics for the most devastating events she ever had in our lifetime she can't remember how she got there or how she got whole I mean it's like there's all our whole and this woman's case that anything I can ever imagine I Can't help but feel\nThat I think if you ask the gate just\nThe series of how she probably was coast going into last everything this find out that this was completely a scam by the Democrats\nWhich leads to my second point why are they not health just civil and criminal criminal penalties force marrying the good name a judge Kavanaugh\nWell first of all there is no criminal penalty for smearing somebody that I Know of although I guess you could say the so called hate crimes are an effort to do it at a very low level where if you use certain kinds of words you could be charged with a crime on the civil side\nSomebody could sue Dianne Feinstein or Feinstein is the president likes to color or they could sewer for defamation the problem is\nWhen you're suing somebody who's a a public figure and if you happen to be a public figure as well and I think that Christine forwarded this point would be judged a public figure it becomes exceedingly hard to bring any kind of a lawsuit you'd have to prove that\nThat are sort of Brett Kavanaugh I wanted to bring a suit\nAgainst Dianne Feinstein he'd have to prove that what she said was untrue number one number two that she knew it was untrue when she said it because he is a public figure\nAnd number three the tree at actual malice that she said I'm going to get this guy was even if I have to lie about it and I'm going to say things that aren't true\nAnd I think you'd also lose out because\nIn most defamation law that I'm aware of because as a reporter I've had to deal with lawyers for for like Thirty years on defamation laws when it comes to a public figure you have to show that you've actually suffered some dollar damages\nNot just that you lost out on being a Supreme Court member which you know usually pays less than what the private sector would\nI don't think you'd be able to show dollar damages you wouldn't be able to prove that she knew it was untrue when she said it uh and in fact how would you even go about saying that what Christine Ford\nHe's proven bully on true and and that means provable in court by a preponderance of the evidence first of all one of the biggest problems is proving something didn't happen because you know I could I could say to you I could prove\nVarious things that I Do but how do I proved the things I never did or disprove the idea that I did them that that it's hard in almost all cases so they're almost ... and a civil or criminal solution to that\nAnd so and the Democrats know that they're using it to full advantage let's go to Debbie Debbie welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind\n[noise] hey Laurie I'm I just wanted to talk about\nThe um a cabin on I guess my main concern is that um people are saying that he's not fit to be on the court because of his demeanor and\nUh I think that is so wrong because\nThey are dealing with some personal I'm a attacks on him personally and of course he should be angry especially if they're untrue who wouldn't stick up for themselves when you have patently false statements and find the whole country said about ... awful things\nAnd uh but there is no way but I think he was very right to stick up for himself if you don't do it well\nAnd he had to be emphatic about it because he had ten people on the other side they couldn't say I couldn't say this guy was yellow or blue if it was\nThey couldn't tell the truth that their life depended on it and so he had to have a strong defense I mean she that he's a lawyer he's a judge I mean that's that bodes well in his defense\nBut I'm telling you that if he if he gets on the court I just looking at him I think if they're honest I think he dedicated to his profession or he wouldn't be where he is\nI think was the fact that he says this never happened but no way I Want to know that if you wanted to do what they call arguing in the alternative which is some defense attorneys do where you say but if it were true that I did this thing in high school when it happened one time and never happened again\nHow many of us would like to be judged professionally for one thing that happened one time Thirty years ago uh that involve something like this I think most people would say by that standard probably like the president suggested today he says he knows a bunch\nOf people on Capitol Hill from the Democratic party who are dirty themselves and not for things they did in high school things they've done since they got into public office Debbie thank you

each and every week by head coach Justin ... coach thanks as always for being\nHere that wanted to start here obviously a different conversation\nThis week last year or last week we talked about where you were in terms of disappointment with discipline level and you mentioned just being miserable in general just wanted to take your temperature after the response that your team showed ... down ...\nWell we certainly put out a bunch better product um and not just because we won the game you know I just thought everything from our sidelines or emotion\nOur discipline level was improved dramatically in my opinion um you know on our level of play ... was better it was indicative that and um you know I was happy to see our guys respond you know our coaching staff did a great job getting the guys\nReady to play and then our kids we went out there and executed or the plan that was put together all that being said\nIt doesn't take very long watching the film to realize that we ... we still have a long way to go and um we have a lot of improvement Jamaican that teaching cannot stop with our guys when you have a useful group or an inexperienced group\nYou know what I mean we're literally you know walking him through everything still and you know I'm hoping that we can continue to retain that information sometimes it's a little bit like a ...\nA movie fifty first date you know we're like you to repeat it gets something taught and then I go home and they go to sleep and wake up the next morning I Can't remember any of it and we're we're kind of going back through that a little bit I'm hoping we can start to retain some of that are moving forward but I'm all in all much much better a product\nYou Adam Sandler robbed of an Oscar by the way and the way he played a very large would marry more it was a very very\nGood at art in a couple of people mentioned to me and I could kind of sits didn't see it a little bit too you were a little bit more fired up on the sideline as well [noise] well I feel like um [noise] I don't know if I was or wasn't but I Do think that um you know there's a level of of this team\nThis team needs some some about I think you know like my first team here don't need any of that you know ... and maybe they needed that behind closed doors but I think I felt like that maybe my role needed to change a little bit I'm trying to help those guys out in\nTeaching them what was competitive that was the thing that kind of bothered me the most in the game two weeks ago was\nI thought that we thought in our minds we thought we were being competitive and that and what we were doing was was not what a true competitor would do and trying to teach them that that maybe I took that a little bit for granted after the first game you know just kind of been some ... that\nI should have done a little bit better job so I you know tried\nHow do you learn to introspective look at yourself that way and try to take their gauge where a team is that and say this team might need a little bit more of this ... did it in step back or vice versa\nWell it's difficult I mean I I\nYou know you make mistakes trying to figure it out and sometimes you just don't know I think my overall feeling was um in pre game meal which are preparing meals a little different than most people's it actually turns into a meeting so it's very serious\nOr walk through is leading up to traveling to the game you know I was I couldn't I couldn't really tell like I was trying to judge\nWhere we're at emotionally um you know I I was really can a little concerned that we were going to be scared to make a mistake that was kind of what I started to work my course\nI can convince myself anything good or bad if you think about it long enough but that was starting to starting to go through my head is are these are these guys are really really ready to play or are they\nSo uptight about what happened last week that they're going to be scared to make a mistake and they weren't they were they were ready to play and\nUh you got to kind of feel your way through it sometimes when you go out there and you're you're going out for warm ups and you're seeing that whole side that whole side is full of Virginia Tech than what kind of goes through your mind the team's mine and it just keeps growing and growing and growing\nAnd then after the game it's like the biggest celebration ever sure well it's it was really neat and I'll tell you why you know two years ago we went down there and um\nI was in all of our attendance at the game two years ago and twenty six team uh I think that was really my first experience\nI don't know how the games fell but I was it was a beautiful day I remember that and it seemed like we had the whole one side of the stands was really impressive\nAnd then going into this game I wasn't you know like coming off of the the ODU game you know I thought it was pretty impressive performance bar fans\nPicking themselves up off the map to you know and getting excited to go help our team\nTry and try and win the ballgame and they were into it right from the start and um it's just a huge reward for a kid because these kids really do put a lot of time and energy and make a lot of sacrifices to try and do the best that they can and it's um it's a great feeling when they're rewarded with support\nIt's kind of a continuation of that the way that you received and you walked into the room last week I didn't feel like it was the right time to necessarily acknowledge it last week but I've been doing this a long time kind of gave me chills those interested to the way that you in the program in everybody else's treated through some of those downtime\nAbsolutely you know I you know you don't know\nWhen you walk out on stage after what happened two weeks ago like you don't know if you're going to be at odds in a food or you know what but um you know it's just so we certainly appreciate it we know what's expected and you know I I Try and be\nUm you know honestly it doesn't mean you're going to win every game it just means you know it is our obligation to participate in the event in the right way and I really felt like we did not do that um two weeks ago but to kind of be popped up a little bit\nBut to kind of be propped up a little bit along the way it certainly helps I can tell you that\nMuch people have thrown food but it's usually to Mike and it's under handy ground and then he snacks during the show so I got through with it and sometimes just got to it whether it's a botched

program certainly a commendable performance I Know like\nThe rest of the team you were pleased with the way that he prepared and handled the situation but also came away with some things to work\nOn as well just your overall assessment of of his first start for your team will lead us to say everybody has been given him a hard time about the slide oh yeah right ... short like yeah that's been\nA pretty regular um thing that's been brought up Everytime anybody seizing but and he was pretty embarrassed about the whole thing and you know that's a good teaching point there you know they they mark you down where you're protected but you're marked down where you start to slide and obviously easily had the first down and\nA ... and then they market short as it was pretty embarrassing space was all read when he came over to the side it was pretty upset but anyway um he did play well you know he threw the ball accurately and on time\nOr he protected the football we did have a couple couple of issues that um you know we need to to get cleaned up we had a formal exchange that we recovered\nUm we had one more another kind of missed exchange or the back was on the other side but I'm really pleased with him and happy for more than anything it's not like\nI'm going to be mad at the kid I mean always ever done is everything we've ever asked him to do since he's been here so I'm you know when you get to that point with those guys were there there there every day and they're working hard and they're trying to do whatever you ask them to do you get to the point where\nYou just you want to you want to put them in a position to have success because you know what it means to them what their teammates mean to him\nAnd it was pretty cool to see the kids\nYou know interact with him and and be happy for him as he went out there and play and you know he's such an excitable person you know here's what Josh is so late is so laid back and focus in concert and competitive but concentration and Ryan is\nLike a puppy dog and he's so excited and fired up you know he's I think she's standing next to me and says I'm\nI'm Out so much fun I just can't believe this is what I'm trying to like Ryan quiet [laughter] she's my turn to talk [laughter] but he's he's just you can't help it\nIt's just you can't help but I Love him 'cause he just got such a great outlook he's been through through all kinds of difficulties throughout his career and I'm really proud happy for\nThat's what I thought about that because you figure he'd probably never thought he'd ever get a chance to play at this level again so he's taken full then is that he has his birthday what a perfect weekend for him but the fact that you could really run the ball Duke was going to kind of stacked the box made this kind of performance even better\nThan they really did you know in early in the game Duke was trying to go back and forth between there too high and they're one high stuff and we ran the ball pretty well end of the two high stuff and hurt 'em a couple of times and they said enough of that we're we're loading a boxer and make you throw the ball um\nTo win the game and and even with that we had a couple of things we didn't actually getting the wrong again that we could have\nReally hurt him with in my opinion but we didn't and uh but to see to see a kind of fall on his shoulders for lack of a better term to have to go my place to\nTo to give us a chance to win the game and I felt good he can throw the ball now I mean\nHe's got talent he's he's certainly not out there void of of any ability to make plays and and he has a much better athlete than people give him credit for I think you know he runs pretty well so um you know it's just just happy you know he ... and when you get when you go through your career and\nYou go through what he went through which is playing early on a team that struggle mightily and you know it can it can break your shorts so to speak you are going to hurt your confidence and uh you know for him to get a fresh start and then get an opportunity and play well I think is pretty rewarding\nYou mentioned Josh a minute ago how's he doing mentally physically and then just talk about him in because obviously hidden hooker got a few reps in there he was playing a little bit and obviously he's one player way too so his developmental sure well Josh is doing well surgery won't\nWell I'm you know he's around the office he's um you know on on crutches so you know I'm I'm reluctant to have him I don't want him to get rolled up on the sidelines you can't get out of the way so um but he's he's healing well everything's going well he's got a great outlook in a in a positive attitude and wants to still be\nA contributor on the football team which he will you know he's still got a role to play he's he's and he's going to do a really good job of that um Hynden yeah we ... bread and I talked to going into the game about not a not point Ryan out for an extended period of time but you know we thought maybe it'd be a good idea\nIf you know we need to work hand in hand a little bit you know in case it's in full time you know it wasn't a situation where he only had three or four plays he's the backup quarterback so he's got [noise]\nYou know he's working on the full gamut of the game plan but we just felt like it'd be wise you know ... to to go ahead and work he made a little bit you ride a chance kind of like I talked about using excitable kid maybe ... come over and drink a cup of water and take a deep breath and let him go in

fast enough yes happy birthday indeed\nAnd this Caroline she shares that with you are now starting quarterback Ryan will so that was it at all but of course but it got me to thinking well it is September and you are a coach at the time so that had to lead to a story and maybe we should ask you for that story yeah it did\nUm first of all when I found out it was Ryan's birthday was the same as Caroline a calm fell over my myself I really do because I can remember a twenty sixteen we're playing at Pitt\nAnd all I heard about is how we had one up there we had one up there in the house of horrors is the phrase that I remember yeah sorry about that and we're in us we're finished the third quarter and it's a tight ball game\nAnd I didn't know this but the start of the fourth quarter Pitt plays\nSweet airline and I said over the headsets we're gonna win for sure now and we ended up winning the ball game and then I thought of that exact moment when Ryan said oh my birthdays friday to fall we're in good shape so but Caroline was born on a Wednesday\nI'm no Wednesday afternoon she's one of the only children I've ever met those born at noon on her due date like perfectly punctual um [noise]\nBut we were getting rid of TCU and we were getting ready to play um [noise] we're getting ready to play SMU okay for the iron skillet yeah which is a robbery [laughter]\nAnd um we beat them\nI don't know how many times in a row and I don't know how many times sense but um I got a phone call at like eleven something or other\nAnd said it's go time so I wanted to coach the coach I gotta go I'll be back when I can and I got in the car and go\nAnd I'm driving and I had every red light every traffic deal everything you could possibly imagine I get to phone calls on the way they're from our friend saying are you coming and I'm like yes I'm driving their spouse fall\nSo anyway I pull up into the driveway Jenny standing or in the front yard with their hands on a big tree out in front with their hands over half [laughter]\nAnd the woman that was with her as our friend looks at me like she wants to kill me I'm like I came straight guy didn't do anything else\nSo Gen gets in the car like a blood just sitting out in the driveway and they throw it in ... and we have to drive literally across the street to the hospital literally out of the neighborhood and across the street and um we get we pole and of course now like I like Jens their second kid but Jens\nKind of like I can tell like something's going on like I Need to hurry but I'm not really sure exactly what to hurry and do so I ... I jump out and get a a stroller but a a wheelchair\nAfter all other in a wheelchair didn't need the stroller just yet and I drive through I don't know where I'm going or what we're doing you know I Want to scream for help really is what I Want [laughter]\nAnd Jens breathing heavy and so anyway\nWe get into the to the elevator and it was like you know as I was trying to turn around in the elevator\nAnd it was like you know the Austin Powers are getting a car when he's got the cart going back and forth [laughter] that's kinda what I did a slam in our around trying to get her back around so long story short we get to the fourth floor whatever walk in\nAnd I'm like somebody help me so they take her and they throw it into\nThe room now my man made and and she says go get somebody now\nAnd so I step outside and I said\nMean we need some help here and they come in and she was she was in the in the bad we we she lay down on the bed I looked up at the clock she said give me some hope and it was eleven forty nine\nGay she was born at twelve all for it they didn't know Jenny name they didn't know mine a check yet nothing hay and so like there was a baby and I get no time\nAnd then they did like all their paperwork after we already had the kid like what's your name where are you from all that sort of stuff\nFirst stuff so I'm so I'm sitting there and I'm like well we get the baby all cleaned up and you know I'm like\nOh we got our [laughter]\nFoods [laughter]\nSo anyway the only bad part of the story is SMU beat us at overtime mood that day which really are not that day but that Saturday which is like the only time it's happened and I don't know how long we played pretty well in office do but I'm not pointing fingers but\nWe we did lose the game and like double overtime but when I got home it was it was it was pretty cool\nWell the good news is here in Virginia and iron skillet it's just what you drive by a truck stop diner on your wages and\nYeah so is there any great stories about the other two and they were more in a while I mean yeah I don't really remember the third one by the third one I've checked", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "01"}
