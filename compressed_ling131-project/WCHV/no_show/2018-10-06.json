shorter joins me to talk about how he's battling the growing problem of child sex rings in America\nGreg good to have you on a thank you so much for your service for America\nWell it was a pleasure and I appreciate\nYou having me on last night it was it's always my pleasure to have you here but it's so tell me about a veterans for child rescue\n[noise] well it's a nonprofit organization that I founded\nA with my my daughter especially my daughter last year in March of two thousand so that she was abducted at that point and brutally sexually assaulted for hours at Tucson, Arizona and ... a month later in April we officially filed et cetera search all risk you try to make sure\nThat that didn't happen to to others\nAnd I I was learning already that there was a there was a widespread problem with child trapped in the United states in ... uh\nBut uh but I've got a lot of contacts and colleagues that that could really helped me be instrumental and fighting this problem but rather than\nAddress it as a kinetic problem like law enforcement might I stopped a I could be a better health alerting the populace to it and the best tool to do that to shake the American people awaken in and let everybody know hey this is what's happening to our kids\nA is a documentary so we began filming a documentary and uh\nWe've got Eighteen months of filming now coast to coast or Southeast Asia down on the U.S border and we've been running sting operations with federal and local law enforcement interviewing different witnesses and surviving victims of family and\nAll aspects of the ... the crisis really to just try to empower the American people with the knowledge of what's happening to the kids with child trafficking because it is estimated that at one hundred and fifty billion dollar industry there's an estimated ... million children\nBeing bought and sold as merchandise right now on the sex trade as that so that that's not okay with me so that's what's that's for ... rescue is it's an alert piece to to alert the American populace to empower us against it so that culturally we can put that the bad and a stand up against it\nTogether Greg Gunn so horrific inspiration for what happened I have to ask how is your daughter doing\nWell she's tough she's she's a fighter it was a horrifically um\nImpactful against her obviously she had just turned Eighteen at the time and uh I'll I'll share one little snap\nBut I mean I'm not asking you to go beyond you know I mean I I don't want to dig too much but I mean we want to know how your daughter's doing so\nYeah but on a positive or she has served as a junior ... age it with us on a on a very large and powerful joints sting operation and she's been instrumental in helping put away several pedophiles child predators and she has stood there and watch them get and cost and put away\nSo that was very empowering for her and she said you know pop up that was more healing than any amount of counseling or anything else could have ever been so she's a fighter she's going to be okay and I think she's going to be an inspiration there to help to others you know ... and just kind of house she's wired\nI think that somebody we ought to find a way I have some acquaintances and co workers who've who've been sexually assaulted and everyone reacts differently I Know women who don't ever want it mentioned again I Know women who will tell you exactly what happened you know because they believe that I think it helps give them some catharsis so\nPeople should not assume that when when someone has been the victim of a sexual assault that they that everyone reacts and same that they they don't want to talk about it in some cases they do a and and being you know hearing the story and all that helps them out as you said it did for her daughter\nMany women and girls might not have had the strength to do with your daughter did to to live through that to recover from it and then to go out and help catch the bad guys uh that's that's an incredible show strengthened and I can't say enough good things about a young lady willing to do that\nWell you're right we do all relax react to things differently\nAnd sometimes it's a timing issue sometimes ah somebody may hibernate a bet with that with the pain and want to be quiet about it and then later in life there like you know whatever okay be ... or else by the time to speak out so uh whenever whenever\nI I support anybody's method of dealing with it I mean\nI wouldn't want I wouldn't wish on anybody and I think that's why I'm so passionate about fighting it and just and turning our culture against it you know back in the Nineteen fifties there is a man named Alfred ... falsified a bunch of sexual studies\nMake it sound like a pedophilia and child rape was somehow okay and he softened our laws to soften dire psychological system it's often on our educational system\nPedophilia as fast forward three generations later we've got an epidemic of child rape and I don't want that to happen to anybody so I think what we have got to do now is turning the culture back against that which has proven to be so harmful to\nChildren whose minds are not yet fully developed they cannot advocate for themselves against a fully grown creditor and we've got to defend the defenseless we've got to rally around our children and and defend against a these these harmful adult predators\nI'm Talking to ... a former special operators sniper for Navy SEAL team one and a founder of veterans for child rescue [noise]\nWhat do you hope to show in the documentary to to bring attention to some part of this from were not aware of because we know there was a child sex trafficking uh you know practice in this country and we'd like to shut it down and it seems amazing that a country like this has had such a tough time getting a handle on is\nWell it's a global problem and and for some reason it seems like it's being suppressed in the mainstream news media they will tell us what's going on with it it it is the fastest growing criminal enterprise on earth so why are we the citizens in old\nVery deliberately and very specifically what's going on so to answer your question what I what I intend to share with the American people is that which they need to know\nFight this epidemic that's happening to our children that they're not otherwise be talk literally just to walk the American people through the truth whatever that may be\nTo show that different aspects of what is really going on with the kids so that we the citizens can understand the nature of this threat and and effectively defend our children accordingly\nYou know Craig I I don't know whether you agree with is um but I'd like to get your take on it I see an awful lot of so called homeless people on the street now some of them are there for mental problems over there for drug problems\nBut I get the feeling that when a young man or woman or a young child who's under Eighteen says I'm leaving my parents' house sometimes are leaving because of bad things that have happened sometimes are leaving\n'cause they don't like mom and dad's rules and when they started living on the streets\nIt seems like that is the prime opportunity for these traffickers to get a hold of them and and uh and get a hold on them and and and start to prostitute them and and that that seems like something we could take care of if we stop making the assumption that if you don't want to live with mom and dad\nA ... ... you know then you can go out and live on the streets and a lot of cities like it or not aid and abet people and living on the streets and they get in the way of returning those children even to their original household bore\nTo foster family but not tolerate them simply living in probably the most vulnerable spot that can live in on the streets without adults around\nVery astute observation you're absolutely right there are predators waiting for a young writer ways waiting for the boys at for the girls\nIf you think that that your son or daughter can go run away in the middle of the night and go to a bus or or or or place to catch a cab or or or homeless people hang out and not have predators they're\nReady for them to offer them a place to stay in a shelter um drugs or whatever else uh it'd be\n[noise] yeah I think that's right so there's ... there's there's three groups I think people that we that we should think about one that people with a criminal record you know employers have often been worried to hire those areas you know tens of millions of of of Americans with from the records has a\nBunch of those I think have struggled to find work those are slowly I think\nBeing brought it back into the labor force than there are people who've been unemployed for a long period of time that still over a million people some people have been unemployed for more than half a year hopefully those folks can now find jobs\nAnd then there's the last group and I think that's the great where where the social damage comic play more of that the people who haven't been looking out at the labor force for for a for quite a while or that good about a million people you know I can bring all those people back in ... I think the labor hard situation really is that\nIt's been in the last fifty years ah you know I think right now the late nineties still look pretty good you know that it had higher labor force station so not only the unemployment rate low but basically everyone was trying to find work we can get back to that then I'll be fully satisfied\nWill stay on the limited throwing idea ... I was down in Dallas texas couple of years ago to to do broadcasts for one of our stations and I saw a company that was advertising its services\nIts services construction company but I think they called themselves con structure and they had a clever name and and on the rest of the ban or they had on the side of a building it made it clear they would hire ex cons they would hire people with criminal records and why\nWell because you know while there may be some additional steps you have to take to make sure that if you hire somebody with a criminal record that your tools aren't going to disappear but once you've\nUh you know I've talked to plenty of callers to my show who said I have a ... a felony record and I tell all my employers when I first go to work for him or when I first interview I have this record on beyond it I've I've I've corrected my behavior and I'm going to be a great employee for you and instead we have\nGovernment's trying to ban you know even asking about criminal record I almost wish we could encourage people if you're gonna go straight and you're gonna straighten out your behavior\nThen we're we're happy to have you tell us that so as an employer you can take advantage of the skills that come with that person who may be a very good worker\nWants to get past that but I don't want the government doing and I want a private employer and maybe somebody who says I'm going to start a construction company and I'm going to hire these people and I'm going to put them to work and I'm going to expect performance and I'm an expected they don't go back to criminal behavior but other than that I'll pay him a good wage because then you've got access to a a whole crowd of people who may not being\nBe accessed right now by conventional employers who just screen you out of the beginning does that make sense\nThough that may settled since we we've started to see a little bit of that so for example Wal Mart which of course is that you know the the largest employer of\nThem all ... million and a have employees in the U.S but they've started you know trying to target a or reject federal records a little more they're recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll work out\nSo where can we go from here how low can go before the wages just start rising because employers fund that can't get anybody to work for them if they don't ... you know bumped the wages up\nWell I I think first of all we'll we'll see if we can absorb those additional maybe two three million people want that to happen I think you'd start with the wage growth as long as you know of course the economy I keep growing right so if we\nIf we suddenly at our recession we wouldn't see it that you know given all the fiscal stimulus we've had from the from the tax cut from the\nYeah the increase in spending I think the next\nCouple of years we should we should really start to see some ... at least in the long run you know wages only keep increasing if we you know we develop new technology that build new factories and better equipment and things like that so\nYou know ultimately that's where we're at a wage growth is that it's going to have to come from them that uh the choirs innovation to continue with people wanting to invest and things like that\nWell we got a break in Sacramento stand on that note you mentioned the tax cuts is not just income taxes\nIt's instant expensing or rapid expensing equipment so it used to be if you bought a a new big piece of equipment to expand your capabilities uh comedy new excavator anew bulldozer or a new machine at your factory\nYou had to take the tax savings on it over ten or Fifteen or Twenty years now you can take 'em right away so there's a tremendous incentive\nFor companies go out and expand their

I'm sure you've been through this it sounds like you've been through hill I'm sure when did you leave your fulltime job\nUm it's been a couple of years now it ...\nYeah I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did [noise] um since then\nWill you let me tell you you're emotionally not pass that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday yeah I mean it's you know we're living in the abuse aren't you\nIn your head\nYeah I mean my kids and I we we were homeless for a while we we've just been through a lot and I read he tried to\nGet custody of them I had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot\nI hear you so basically none of these bills the foreclosure or all the bills that he opened up and your name have been paid for years\nYeah correct human paid anything on them for years\nWithdrawn as America was the lead your Kimberly is with us in Alexandria, Virginia\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey thank you so much for taking my call sure I was a lot lately my [noise]\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nStill works He works in a steel plant\nMakes about four fifty to six fifty a week um about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had ... hey here's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow ... got a Fifteen thousand dollar loan from the bank\nAnd he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred\nAnd some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I give at this stage for him um I did provide hands I took over all the bills\nI did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of that I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying on his cell he still has about a\nFifteen K left on the equity loan ... ten thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the couch and hurting and everything was a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to\nWhat is it a month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about\nFour thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two is I get the right\nTo have on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right rankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plant that I understand that right yeah ... there's going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent parts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh definitely\n[laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five taught as in New Hampshire I taught how are

agreement there we're going to work this plan together okay and want you to do that then you're first goal which you squeeze out of your budget as you say that that was in dollars if you already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home busting your debts smallest the laws\nYou attack those were caused by getting rid of those that famous now you've got the ability to invest\nAnd then you start retirement as they used to\nShow that book is going to walk these rooms and make sure you and your wife or what does that yeah there\nFace it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal it's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our sorry budgeting tool called every dollar\nSeeing how that affected other people in the

I gave a tenth of my income off the top before I start anything to my local church so I don't pay myself first I'm but putting yourself a head of your bills\nAs a general philosophy and saying I'm going to save money I'm going to make savings a priority I'm gonna make investing a priority this is what people do to\nBuild wealth and so yes I Would famous evangelist Martin Luther said I'm no it wasn't it was John Wesley Martin Luther what am I thinking was famous manual is you got that part right Wesley said\nIf you'll give ten percent and saved ten percent and live on eighty percent you'll always be okay and you know there's not a bad formula but that's also putting God first few seconds and then living on eighty\nAnd figure figure out there to live on your income after you're giving in you're investing\nAnd you'll always that money that part is accurate and then we you know we have we involve that a little bit of the baby steps where when your own baby step one you don't do anything do you save a thousand dollars and baby step to you're not saving any money in baby step too including stopping all your investments temporarily [noise]\nBecause you're completely doing your debt snowball you're focusing on the debt why so we can save more later so that's the technical parts of the answer but in general you've got to put your giving and you're saving at the top of your list at the top of your\nPriorities because you're gonna have a better life if you always give and save\nAnd then live on what's the last well\nOf speaking baby steps Wesley formula whatever you're going to

E. they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders they guy lockers\nSaid I'm Wondering ... thanks for taking my call sure what's up a few years ago I resigned our children for Florida prepaid college\nPlan and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and since then our income has gone down and we added another child and we've gotten into a credit card debt and they had a car loan now\nAnd we can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without the chilly here that are hitting ... path right that can leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan\nHow much is in there [noise] um about eighty six hundred eighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards off five thousand\nOkay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realized when you get that baby steps out of order like having that Peter Pan pre played pan and then I don't know what to get its point gotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] um I had the next forty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nSo about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency or no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an E. S. A. and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the recent anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right\nSo how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition by paying it ahead of time\nThat's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent\nTwo percent inflation right so that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time mind\nAnd so on you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say outgrow you're eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund at\nSome point right now I just stopped adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a a ... I was going through recipe you for the last seven years and we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because\nThis was a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen or we were at my family my\nParents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a tie mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell\nAnd cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want to ... you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if\nAfter it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one of the reasons west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom baby him I mean but a ... and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in\nA [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or what you it's it's a centrally\nIt's essentially a they're looking at a three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you're just on my way\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling the house\nWe're deciding on how much to\nTalk or if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table to shut debris million dollars on it would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it\nThat I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars part of the mill kitchen type ... go by what rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with as getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well\nIt might but I started getting less rock markets less risk than growing holes yeah we're a hundred percent error that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to\nDo these are family owned a and so you can't just felt like yours off\nYou know this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father ...\nOh I see so it's a just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nYes All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least shell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you\nKnow if it struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advisers that families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nBe caught up in ... [noise]\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial coke did they do that I Would say no [noise]\nSo I I Would take the majority or all of that money off the table [noise]\nThe news to have a blessing like that do\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over in Knoxville and one of the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more ... more repair them and you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is whether Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHow they how you doing better than I deserve what's up in your life\nI have a friend who following new information and I think ... single parent and I just got a job in the month of march\nAnd I'm like I make enough income but it's like I don't have any money left over ten street in my car and I work

your house payment I pay for rent okay and how much is your car payments to Ninety two a month okay I'm not sure on their car and they have eight thousand less so\nThat's not bad but your your take home pay three thousand that's thirty six thousand a year so that means you're probably making about forty five thousand before taxes right\nAt each pay take it out and then some and so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety ... till about three thousand you know how it all in income\nOr a little over three okay uh\nWell you don't have a lot of wiggle room here raising two boys um ... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills\nWhat that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget where every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be for this month before the month begins and you assign every dollar\nAnd so we would start with Todd off the top you said you're either med school I'm not the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tie this done now what are we gonna do next well we're going to eat\nSo second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget you set that money aside\nAnd then what's the next thing you know you put your life in your water okay then what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch\nOkay he probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations correct there give or take right\nI don't know what you want to know the only man that much left over food um\nBut you know you probably got twelve hundred maybe not let's just call it a thousand you know after you just you run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus ... minus ah my my uh food budget whatever most shut up for food\nAnd a minus ... minus my lights and water now I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else oh now we got pay a car payment or they're going to report that thing\nWe've got to put gas in the car now how much is left\nOnly then that we spend money on something else\nBut you can't go buy

it's not going to be effective say that\nBut that doesn't\nErase the fact that we're dealing with some genuine in comprehensible emotional problems on the part of these people and I have to give credit where credit's due it was a little blurb by Jim guarantee at National Review it caused the explosion\nActually you know where am I don't have to earn a round of ours that had his hand out the window and a vehicle or oh oh come on down you know my dad always warned me about that I mean there's there's so many things but we're going to jump around we'll get back to California and the transit thing but this actually\nSegue these this nanosecond of incident segue perfectly into talking about trailers because you've got a couple of things that made me think about this um\nFirst of all everybody in the world can go to let's just use you know a generic like the next go to a U Haul dealer and they'll put up a ball on the back of your car and fit you up with the trailer and off you go\nOkay wow that's just amazing and then they'll also rent you a big box truck and turn you lose\nTwo they are they are yeah [laughter]\nWow that's just amazing and then they'll also rent you a big box truck and turn you lose\nTo a they had I had to tell you yeah [laughter] and and\nYou got to think about this just a little bit first of all from the person using this device you know having a trailer new you all trailers or you know typically rather small but but there are other ones that you can get an overhaul on boats right or just you know even lawn equipment\nWould have trailer about where you're at\nRight so all of these things are just have you know sometimes we don't really think about it because we're going to be doing things let's say ... little utility trailer\nAnd we're going to be taking some some things to the landfill or we're going to go pick up a little lumber down the street and bring it home that's all kind of well and good and let's just to spend a licensing\nAnd and I want to and this and that well if I were just for the moment but\nThe second you take this device now whatever your small large what have you learned unloaded out onto the interstate the game has changed\nMan you are in the real world now ... you know and and so yeah let's take the licensing\nJust well you know I recently and I'm just very recently last weekend I'm a native remark about losing a trailer and he said oh don't worry don't worry it's got a permanent lifeless I pay the extra money for that\nNo clue that they needed to have that thing inspected\nWell I mean right right right right right it's got to be expected the brakes have to work the ... the lights have to work all these little things I mean there are some trailers in some sizes of trailers that I guess don't have to have lights they ever collectors I'm not positive about that but\n[noise] I Know that there's also a weight restrictions that has multiple uh fast it's first of all the trailer hitch\nHas to be rated for the weight of the trailer that you're going to be pulling okay okay so there's one consideration and not just the little ball on the back but when it's connected to yeah right so you know do your bumper doesn't count\n[laughter] no it doesn't do the frame and it's got a ... mile of black\nYup yup all of that has to be in place or the amount that you are allowed to do\nHas to do with your your registration and licensing and you reach a point of I Believe it's twenty five thousand pounds and then you have to actually well that's a lot absolutely\nUh but that then you have to have a different kind of diverse idea yeah you have to have a CDL I Believe you know um yeah\nSo me driving a truck with our sixteen foot trailer fully loaded with stuff\nIsn't going to hit that probably\nI don't think so I don't think so but it is there is a licensing or a a a weight you know that you have to register with that to be legal and then your load has to be secured and such a way that is going to be says there are um\nWe also have anti sway bars in other things\nThere's an emergency break you know he built into it that has kick in and and your little ah connections and everything along with it but\nThe outside of the danger again just sticking with the licensing a ... the fines that they ... for a trailer malfunctions are outrageous and it would be\nThe fines that they ... for a trailer malfunctions are outrageous and it would be an amazing event\nFor you to be able to pass a really scrutinize trailer inspection yeah there's always something they'll find something and so you know you really gotta be careful in in just in\nThat ... end and driving through the ... the extremely careful yeah with all the boats that come through there they had discovered that there you know that it's good money\nI think they've slowed down just a little bit just because they kind of got a reputation and I don't know what people were doing taking the long way around\n[laughter]\nThat's yeah because you could always nail somebody for a trailer infraction absolutely yeah it's it's your view would be gosh I don't know what you'd have to do to pass a hundred percent\nWe've never had problems passion well aren't you had you've had you've been pulled over and no ... no without adequate auto inspectors go hit it out I could I'm Talking about when you get pulled over oh no I don't ever taken out anymore so right\nSo anyway that's that's just one thing so getting back to the road and then they ... probably ... probably ask [laughter] get it but that's part of the problem is you don't use it very often said then you've got to use it in and it's got ... before you really use it and\nLots of things that you know the brakes start sticking you know I mean you know because they just sit there things don't go out and the tires just sitting so um\nSo what I was going to say too about the safety issue that is that the I'm thinking about it you know when you're out there and you're the person driving\nMaybe you are aware of your trailer and the length of it and you know when you pass people if you're going to do such a thing or and people pass you or what you got to do your ability to stop at cetera you know these things that you should test out but here's the other thing it's almost like people with a brand new driver's license\nYou know when you when you are not the person with a trailer behind it but you're seeing somebody with a trailer\nAre they an experienced person with right you don't know that it's just like you know a brand new driver\nYou know some kid who's you know Fifteen just turned sixteen\nGot their license and the parents go okay let's get out on Ninety five and see how you do today you know it's like you've got to have to do it for the first time some ... yes and is this your lucky day that you're dealing with this person as they learn to drive a patient\nWell how about if you don't know the highway right around here and you say you're coming from Stanton\nAnd and you get to the interchange where twenty nine dumps on to sixty four\nAnd you're just Boston down the highway feeling pretty good wait a minute you're ... you're on sixty four sixty four okay and you get to that twenty nine interchange eastbound yeah okay wow\nThat's a moment yes that's a moment even when you know about it ... it's a moment\nBut if you you know think you're going to for some reason just do Seventy in the right hand lane mistake right up to speed changes there and everything so that the trailer and everything I don't know it's like to just think about things like\nThat yes you do that\nAnd you can stop thinking about it because we're going to take a break [laughter] hey we'll be back with something else I promise\nAnd better living melding supply things really do come to those who wait but you won't have to wait much longer\nOn this is John ...

had a blowout on interstate sixty four one time on a trailer that I was hauling a piece of machinery piece of machinery is quite heavy and and the blowout\nWow there's a moment for you and fortunately

of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone\nTakes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract day and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back and neck you feel the tightest right\nAs a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy now and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that\nCompletely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many ... acids issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith Kelsey um being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it gets a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great ... is really incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nRight and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for now ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd I want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners\nSo when you call the shirt and mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain in stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you it's lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up the phone\nIf your digestive health and human reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you tried the ... formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age\nCal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative book\nAnd forget Chris I'm going to give away free bottle my comment formula one hundred color so it's really important for your listeners to pick up the phone and take advantage of that\nWill thank you for doing that Dr Pincus I really appreciate it folks this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for every member you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pick us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby well\nThat's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the sciences or little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] Dr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles and they need him actually helps the transmitters and the nerve\nAnd when you take this complex formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I\nI drank it over a ten day period yeah and it it completely alleviated the problem now what about heart disease heart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah\nAnd if anyone has any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be\nIn her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris\nIt'd be entering yeah could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I ... or the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was eighty four years old and a week later\nShe was ... she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nSo that is amazing and when I use this with professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using this before there are events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system well the very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them it's also blocking\nFurther absorption does and sometimes it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle it sure is\nAnd we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nMy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\n... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you

on your body weather's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how you're killing ... formula\nInformation should know\nInformation\nThe countless number of Americans have been affected by the opioid crisis addiction impacts individuals from every walk of life\nOur next guest is made addiction and recovery reform his life's mission is non profit organizations cold facing addiction and he's written a book titled American fix inside the opioid addiction crisis and how that ended we welcome Ryan Hampton to info track\nRyan you developed an addiction to opioids yourself can you tell us that story\nSure you know I had kind of a rising star when I was younger I was really involved politically did well in school I went to college at an up and coming career and then in two thousand and three as a result of an ankle injury and an injury that I had while hiking\nI was prescribed the high grade opioid hydro Marco which is also known as the lauded shortly after that\nEnded up in Florida where I got caught up in the height of the mill epidemic\nYou know I Wish I would've known then what I Know now about these drugs about the opioids I was prescribed them the safety of a doctor's office by someone that we are taught to trust and I know it sounds naive but at the time you know I eventually did become a drug user and abuser and sought out the drunks but in the beginning\nI really didn't know I did not know what I was getting myself into I trust my doctor said that they were ... and we now know that my story is not unique to the story of hundreds of thousands of Americans [noise]\nIt was obviously a I assume difficult to get off those drugs\nYeah it was incredibly difficult you know once you go as far down the hall as I did with them it's almost impossible without a medical detox you know I had been on them for so long that when I was up roughly cut off after they had put it in his position databases so you could see if people were seeing multiple doctors\nWhich I was at the time I was cut off abruptly I was in full withdrawal and that's what led me to heroin we now know that eighty percent of heroin user start off with a prescription drug so again it's not an uncommon story\nWhat are some of the challenges that the system faces out there in terms of reducing the abuse of opioids\nWe know what to do we know how to end this crisis we need to be focusing more on recovery right now all the funding goes to prevention and treatment which are two very important thing\nBut the surgeon general's report two thousand six teams on alcohol drugs and help set the science out on this that we have an eighty five percent chance sustaining recovery if we can make it past five years so why are we looking at at the model that starts to support people in the recovery in those first five years\nMost of the money I Would argue Ninety percent of the money gets tied up in that crisis acute ambulatory phase of addiction which is that first thirty days there's no science to support the thirty day treatment models their data that actually support that it does not work\nAnd that being said we need a total reform of the treatment is street from the bottom to the top we need to start supporting recovery sports which includes\nHousing access to employment access to health care people need to be able to plug into pierce for communities that we need to have readily available for them\nWhen they do decide to enter into recovery but our treatment system if people look at the solution just through the scope of treatment they're missing the mark we really have to be looking beyond treatment at the end of the day nine out of ten Americans who need help will not be able to access treatment\nThe treatment gap in this country has Ninety percent so we need to be looking\nAt the end of the day nine out of ten Americans who need help will not be able to access treatment\nThe treatment gap in this country has Ninety percent so we need to be looking at different innovations and solutions and things that are being done on the ground to close that gap heal more communities and save more lives it is like bang my head against the wall when I sit with a policymaker\nAnd try to explain this to them there's billions of dollars right now it's being dictated by the federal government is not trickling down to communities solutions that work we need evidence based solutions but we also need that money to make it to communities and it's not right now\nWe're talking with Ryan Hampton author of American fix inside the opioid addiction crisis and how to end it Brian is we look at the pipeline so to speak of people newly becoming addicted to opioids and of course we've been talking about the people who were already addicted\nHas that improved in terms of rumbling down the new addicts that are getting into the pipeline these new policies that have been enacted you know\nI think it's too early to the full disclosure I'm a Democrat but I support the administration on some of their initiatives they have done some good work on this issue that being said it's definitely not time for a victory lap the data's just not completely out there yet but its indicators are correct\nIt's getting worse I Do not believe that shutting down\nThe supply side if this is going to fully solve this problem we have to be looking at the demand side\nYou could cut off all the drugs from coming into this country we would still be in the midst of a public health crisis and it is still going to get worse we need to be looking at solutions for when people are ready for help we need to be getting people to help\nThat they need same day on demand when somebody overdoses and they go to the hospital they shouldn't be just dark canned and revived released is what we call it are given nor can and they're sent on their way you would not do that to someone who comes into an emergency room\nThat has a heart attack you would get them care you get them critical care they were ... they would probably be under observation birth few days and then they would be given some sort of continue to fall we need more education with doctors on how to deal with that we need more emergency room services peer support services we need to be able to treat people\nWith people who are fleeing and evidence based practices in the emergency rooms when the crisis is taking place these are all simple things that can be done\nAnd they don't cost a lot of money they just take a little bit of effort and they need some lived experience at the table to help lead the way do you have any statistics\nIn terms of how many users of opioids do become addicted\nThe numbers continuously fluctuate it depends on the study we've seen varying numbers\nAnywhere from under twenty percent to\nWell over forty percent it really depends it depends on the length of the time that person is on the opioid it depends if it was a legitimate prescription age has something to do with it too young people are way more apt to becoming addicted then some older adults I Will say though\nRegardless of what that's his take is we should not be punishing legacy pain patients and chronic pain patients in the midst of this health crisis there are people who need these medications for pain they are legitimately prescribe and they should be on\nThe work that our movement is doing we're not trying to take their pills away\nI just want to stop seeing friends die\nNow should we be limiting medication an emergency room setting\nYes that's just six is actually a large emergency room physicians\nNow should we be limiting medication an emergency room setting\nYes that's just six is actually a large\nEmergency room physicians I Believe are five times more likely to be quick with the prescription pads and opioids than your normal non emergency room physician we should not be handing out opioids to people as first line of defense when people come into the emergency room\nThere is a large number of people do become addicted that way and start off in the emergency room setting\nIf someone was listening and perhaps they have a family member or a friend or loved one who has a problem with opioids what would you tell them\nThat probably the most important question you asked me this entire interview love them try and find some empathy I Know it is incredibly hard I Know that some families do need to set boundaries and I respect that but don't shut the door on them to be there for them when they are ready to us for help\nEncourage them to seek help do not be silent about\nTalk about it don't be afraid to bring up the subject with your loved one let them know that it is okay this is a health problem it is not a moral failing\nI suffer in silence for well over a decade in my opioid addiction\nI was afraid to talk about it my mom was pre talked about it my sister was afraid to talk about it makes sure and have that conversation it should be talked about at the dinner table each support if there are great places to look for help one place you could check out the independent is are nonprofit ac diction resource Harvard's resources dot facing addiction ... or\nYou can pretty much math all resources recovery resources treatment resources prevention resources that you may need right in your backyard and there is help available don't shut them out of your life and always believed as long as someone is breathing there is hope for recovery\nAnd the

like I was at Costco and the week before the storm is going to hand and there was water leaving out of there by the truckload if everyone I've got ten I think ten cases at my house and and ended up that we didn't need it\nBut think about our brothers and sisters entered in the state over from us in two states that that desperately need these supplies that'd be a good way if we if we can take a tenth of what we purchased and make it and take it out to this drive today what we can do to even fill more controversial show\nOh it's amazing carbon and you know this is the the thing so it's going seven AM till seven PM okay and Sunday and maybe Monday if they need to okay up and we're at the Rutgers bill Walmart\nOkay right there on the nine\n... by the double tree upon a park mark okay\nAnd Shenandoah Joe's on question which is where my wife and I are going to be loading the truck today were volunteering to help out that's the other thing they need they yeah loading these trucks

at a minimum if if they go back at all and that's the that's the thing I think is really inspired us in Charlottesville to be given\nI tell you what Joe ... our church the the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints to helping hands on the program that we have we're putting together a to relieve trips coming up one is October sixth and seventh and the other one is November third and fourth\nAnd Reagan worry me taking hundreds of people from the Charlottesville Shenandoah Valley area and I'm going to put a link up on our\nFacebook page at work a and also just maybe we'll have

Internet to hell with their fears large portion of what we know\nFor sure is the FBI report\nDid not corroborate any of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh and the second thing we know for sure is that there's no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats are they've always got a reason why the goalposts needed to be moved nothing we could do would satisfy them their dog\nThat's Mitch McConnell and he's right the Democrats are dug in their dug into a position that's looking more and more week\nEvery moment that goes by especially after the FBI report came back it officially arrived at the White House last night arrived at the U.S Senate today\nIt is being closely held sealed in a Mason jar now it's actually in a room where as a U.S senator you have to show the proper ID that you've got the background and all that then they allow UN know copies of it there is exactly one copy of it at the White House one copy at Capitol Hill\nAnd they're looking at over and here's the well here's at least as much of an indication as we have\nYou know that there are Republicans out there\nWho are a little bit squishy when it comes to things conservative well two out of the three undecided Republicans have already well they've looked through much of the report maybe not all of it and they have called the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh ... and his accuser Christine Ford\nThey've called a thorough and I think as much as we can tell anything from that if they're saying it's Thoreau and that they now have covered to say well the FBI is looked into it Christine forward gave her testimony a week ago on Thursday of last week\nAnd she was very sympathetic but was she convincing Brett Kavanaugh was angry\nAs I think any man would be or woman would be if falsely accused\nAnd he was convincing he'd get back up what he said she could not and now after the FBI has delivered its investigation which the Democrat said oh I Can't possibly get done in a week\nCourse these are the same Democrats who are totally confident that the FBI could thoroughly review the six hundred thousand emails on congressman Tony wieners laptop remember all that stuff that came to the former congressman because his wife was one of the key right hand people for Hillary Clinton\nAnd he had all those classified emails on his computer and they said no problem will breeze through those six hundred thousand emails\nThey were done in about three days if you could do that in three days\nProvide back up support for all shares functions focused mainly on officer safety and unfounded

that some of those who managed to read the investigation the quick additional background check that was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough and now at this point the Democrats are I think are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting is going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nMy friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and former federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on I Want to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do this additional background checking and those who've read it say the report shows\nNothing new that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and ... for\nWell thanks so much larger there's nothing surprising about there'd be nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin\nAnd that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to cooperate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the light you have forty nine\nDemocrats who do not want to have a fifth\nReliable conservative vote on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this\nBeyond the midterms so that\nThe Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and to defeat a cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat Merrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy or in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to try to impeach him but I I look to the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this uh for the weekend Lars but there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on that are no longer\nThe kind of norms that you can absolutely thank God I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um that that we maintain the tradition that judges can't be a it can't be impeached unless they've engaged in some kind of a misconduct or use their offices abusive late\nBut you know there's all kinds of norms that we've we've had that are no longer you know you you've had two or three generations of students who have been told that norms are\nBasically uh instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and denied their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been to explain my audience and I think you'd back me up on this and told me if I'm wrong that if they had kept it to an eight member court would effectively be effectively made a lot of the tightest decisions of for foreign effectively and know it would have new to the Supreme Court to a large extent\nBut could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh and and by doing I Would still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\nI think she would because he would just put his head down and continue to do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him\nOn the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed is so remote\nA ... as to be a loose ori that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrat Scott ... majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would count for much\nAndy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy with the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left or ... dodging America and here's a great example of it but let me ask you a political question\nDo you think that the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today that it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search in ...\nSearch and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout to Senator John Cornyn drought today do you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes this fall\nWell I think laws if you look at as I understand it if you look at for example the the polling that we're all looking so carefully at\nOf the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively or trying to hang on what we're seeing is that\nThere's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power and in this case that the left with Trump and has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of of voting against\nTrump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh what they've done is awake and they usually more than\nA party in power for the midterms in mid term elections all all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on they people looking at this and they're frightened by it\nAnd that means that that they miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do a name to charge were Dr Ford's name has come out Christine forward\nAnd that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was an even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweat neck which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got all kinds of of other baggage she brings with her and then as they did that\nThey started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turn off Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp has come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit her good faith that Jim was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous\nPeople now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it turns this whole\nIdea of advice and consent into search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life\nDestroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should rightly be frightened by that\nTwenty almost Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was used inappropriately to no friend or a real a real creep in Bill Clinton or where you'll rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women\nAnd at that time they said oh you can engage in the politics of personal destruction I guess unless it it benefits your side and I hope Republicans see all this and say we're never going to behave this way no matter how much of my cost us so we will not do it and I I I for the most part I don't think they will\nWhere you can ask a follow up questions a crush\nOn a long time what you don't want you to know the location\nYou could ask questions about it we have this kind of\n... so what do you realize that I Can't tell over me\nJerry ... I'm trying to be ... I'm going to keep my question shirt you keep your answer short\nShe was asked where this happened she doesn't know where it happened do you know when it happened or even what year it happened and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and sent its best aging in and said ask her again you know where this or any answer would change\nThe actually she knows more information than that how do you know if the north and she stayed at so we're we're pretty close we actually there are questions I get to where exactly what time of please\nGive it to happen what time of year and the Republicans cut short that questioning by that he loved us sugar that why didn't the Republicans\nCouldn't even hold on hold on to Jerry Jerry don't hard when\nYou miss state facts the Republicans got five minutes at a time and they turn their time over to the professional sex crimes investigator for the Democrats each each of the questions on the panel got five minutes at a time they got exactly the\nThe got exactly the same amount of time and and one of them spend all his time asking about sports and in about a about what flying was in high school or you know and what devil's triangle was which turns out to be a drinking game just as he said so when you say the Democrats didn't have time to ask her word happen\nShe's been very clear in all the things you said in her letter to find signs in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened in jury you realize how ridiculous is is to say you've only the FBI it after the question for five more times her answer might have changed\nLet's go to another nicer now that's where we go my wife when the grandbabies around mental welcome to the program\nA high Lars I I uh I

thing is\nHe's a liar liar but what does he lie about he is he is the little um thing where he jobs around the question and doesn't answer it\nActually did answer that of course I went back and look

like\nHe will be nervous he's been why did\nHe ... he hasn't been in politics she's been on the bench as a judge and it it operates a whole different way than what that hearing to the other day and the second thing is when you say he shouldn't be nervous this is a man who's about\nTo see his entire career flushed down there to maybe\nDown the tubes maybe never be a judge again maybe never be a

controlled the plane and when I saw a radio controlled helicopters I thought that would be fantastic now when I was a kid I never had the money to afford something like that\nI can afford it but I don't ah I don't have the time for that kind of thing but I'm fascinated with what drones and the problem is they hold\nFor being able to improve all kinds of things when used by various folks within our society and I've seen them used by farmers to make sure that their crop yields are up and it's amazing how that works I've seen them used in some cases by law enforcement the problem is\nWe may also see them used by criminals while I've invited Jason's need on who's a policy analyst at the Edwin Meese Center for legal and judicial studies that heritage Jason good to have you back on the program\nBased you're having it so did the police need the ability to be able to either shoot down or bring down drones if they end up being used not just by terrorists but by ordinary criminals as well\nAs the uh to that question absolutely yes\nYes uh you know we are on the cost of really I think a revolution\nAnd what Germans are going to be able to do in terms of productive in positive things for society we're talking about engaging in life saving activities that can bring a emergency medical equipment to the scene of an accident ... minutes or helping to find someone who was lost in a community\nThese are uses the drones are being up to two right now and I think we're going to see a lot of that but we also see that uh you know as with any new technology where is also a potential for misuse and abuse and there have certainly been a fair number of cases in just the last few months\nWhere drones are being put to a novel criminal or or even terrorists purposes\nAnd law enforcement uh unfortunately does not have presently the ability to do much if anything to stop the\nJews and before we go to the ability to bring him down can you give us a couple of examples about crooks have been using them\nShore so really what we're seeing\nIs that criminals are at least this innovative when it comes to to finding new uses for drugs as entrepreneurs and innovators the commercial side uh we've we've looked at some of the instances at a at heritage when we were doing some research on this and I was quite frankly floored by by how drawn to be used we've seen cases where\nA a you know common burglars are using drones to uh to case houses before they break and we've seen instances where drones are being used essentially to serve as a if you will of criminal Airforce actually surveilling the law enforcement personnel who are attempting to a Surveillance Act against organized crime\nOr and then of course it just last couple of months we've seen how drones can be used it in a terrorist attempt\nOr when you look at the Venezuela instance ah incident excuse me a where allegedly there was an assassination attempt on the president of Venezuela and it was too drones armed with explosives that we're going to be the instruments for that assassination attempt\nSo really it runs it runs the gamut but then there are also just cases where people are flying a nickel gently or recklessly and there are a number of instances where drones have been observed\nIn the flight lines of airports and in fact you can go on YouTube and see a really impressive but clearly dangerous videos of drones just a few feet above a man jetliner coming in for a landing\nI'm trying to remember I thought I heard about but maybe it was just one somebody imagining what they could be used for but you know that getting contraband inside of prisons has been a big business was literally send them out to millions of dollars whether it's drugs or weapons with those kinds of things and I'm Wondering whether\nPeople have tried to use that I Can't remember a specific example where that's been done but I Would love to give the authorities the ability to bring drones like that down if they see one flying over in dropping contraband inside the walls\nYou're right that's a very real problem and are in fact there there are some specific examples that come to mind we're just a thing as has happened\nOr in a correctional facility in Ohio for example a a drone was used to smuggle contraband into the prison there apparently it was a accidently drop in the wrong location it wound up in the hands of the wrong a prison gang within the prison walls\nAnd sparked a Seventy five in may ball or in another instance a prisoner was able to use tools that appear to have been smuggled in by drawn to escape in a a maximum security prison\nOr and then at the southern border or not not a prison context but we see what our would have been dubbed narco drugs that are being used to ferry drugs are from Mexico into the United states\nOver the head of a border patrol agents who are just unfortunately powerless to do much beyond tracking those draws to actually interdict\nThrowing things like that we should we have ... if we don't already have from the military the ability to electronically knock these things out of the year should we\nKnock these things out of the year should we allow law enforcement latitude to shoot them out of the year if necessary\nYes what we're talking about now is how to empower law enforcement agencies to engage in what's known as countered drone a operation and counter drone operations there they they run the gamut from a merely using what's known as an unmanned traffic management systems actually air traffic control for drones\nTo restrict access to particular areas I'm so that drunk and not fly into the airspace above say Super Bowl or near an airport all the way to kinetic devices like or even just a plain old fire are just shoot down of drone there are a lot of open questions about\nExactly what the order of operations will be if you will in terms of identifying\nDrones that are posing a threat to public safety warning the operator and then what sort of tools or techniques will be able to properly engage those because as you might imagine if you're dealing with it a true terrorists than than the last thing I think you would want to do is shoot down and drove which might be carrying an explosive device because then of course you create a hazard to the people on the ground\nOf what we have right now is federal legislation that has just been sent to the White House the FAA reauthorization that will for the first time and power federal law enforcement to engage encountered drone activities which to date has been barred\nWell and he's one of the big problems with the fact that these things are largely made up plastic they're not made out of ... models which means that it's going to be tough to spot them unless you can spot them visually and since they're small they're not easy to spot visually from from any kind of distance\nThat's one of the problems or is it actually being able to detect a drone at any reasonable distance because even though these fly at a considerably slower speed typically than a manned aircraft us\nThey still fly pretty fast and so you have to be able to ideas and several miles away from a potential target so that you can add any reasonable amount of time\nTo be able to do the threat assessment to identify the drone and the trigger any counter measures\nAnd so that is certainly one of the challenges that being said uh you know in the ... the the mother of invention and there are a fair number of private sector companies right now that are developing and bringing to market exactly these sorts of technology and we're we're looking at optical cameras were looking at a at radar\nAnd you know other people are looking actually at a a audio equipment they can actually detect the buzzing south of drugs and then you have to be able to identify what kinds of droned trace the signals to the extent that it's not an automated drawn so that you can identify individual user\nThese are all challenges that will need to be a that would need to be dealt with and resolve in the near future\nKnow drinks in a few uh about Thirty years ago it was on board on a coast guard airplane were just shooting a story for television about how they did search and rescue and they got a call up to trace the guy who thought was running drugs it turns out he was and he was in a twin engine aircraft which is a pretty good size aircraft and they gave trades\nAnd the guy knew they were chasing them and we were in a jet a slower speed judge but a jet all the same of falcon and this guy kept dropping down below us\nAnd then would try to turn the other direction and I asked the pilots afterwards I said at what point do you lose sight of this guy if he manages to go east when we're going west before we can turn around you said about four miles out it's really hard to see him and that's a full size aircraft\nOr take it down from full size of the size of a drone one big enough to carry ... let's say a couple of pounds of explosive\nAnd all of a sudden your your ability to see them at any distance may go from four miles to you know half a mile for tens of a mile because because it was amazing to me that we look and say I know the guys out there but try to spot him in the sky from another aircraft was very very difficult\nThat we've taken the call and regulatory dark matter that pours out it's not supposed to be binding however\nIf you disobey it you may not get your permit you may not get your waiver so there's a lot of bureaucratic pressure that can come there what we recommended that the Trump do an executive order kind of like Reagan's executive order that requires the cost benefit analysis that we have now for normal rules\nBut the Trump address these guidance documents 'cause\nHe's pretty much pick the low hanging fruit as far as the two for one regulations right you would imagine that you know he's looked at it you know there's a congressional Review Act got rid of Obama's midnight roles and then he's done some two for one\nOf what of all the uh the rules that are out there but you kind of kind of run run to the end of that so the next thing you should do I think it was addressed guy that's and there's been a lot of significant guy in the bathroom ... guide and\nI was gonna say I was going to bring out or not yeah Wayne I like my audience manageable affected you\nKnow the rule that said the bathrooms in both colleges in public schools had to be open so that a\nA biological boy who now claimed she's a girl can use the ladies' room and and that's that was deeply disturbing for a lot of people they said that any ride and yet he didn't come out of even a regulation that came out of a guy who got it\nWill just quickly the interesting thing on that laws as he got rid of that\nOn that large as he got rid of that but he didn't count it didn't credit himself into two for one also the department of labor got rid of a role in front of a guidance on franchising but Obama has\nCount credit himself or that they got rid of rule on independent contracting that was going to cause additional regulatory burdens for up for independent contractors didn't count that in favor in his two for one cross it\nThere's other guy that you mentioned the FCC that you know there was tremendous guy that's coming out of the net neutrality rules that's being all that now you also guide it's to me is a sense they can since the beer bureaucracy can regulate now without writing anything down I think it's important that Trump\nUse if he could create an executive order that same kind of legacy and sticky power that Reagan's executive order on cost benefit analysis\nHas for guidance documents and I think after the pen and phone era that's an important thing to do especially if we you know\nWe're going to have new elections were going to have democratic presidents again we need to have something in place that\nDiscloses makes transparent transparent and tries to make an effort to roll back the abuse of guidance documents or regular\nDog Wayne let me do a deep dive just a little bit I mean into the wee bit\nAnd here's what I Want to know I can understand why the the regular regulation process is deliberately slow that is\nIt takes a long time to adopt a rag but once again it takes a long time to get rid of it and I understand that because it because anyone rag may have a big effect on industries on people on businesses and everything else\nYou don't want to see them whip sawed\nBut I guess I Wonder as we've gone from a much slower age to now an age where\nThings change dramatically and they change very very fast does government need to have the ability to come up to speed quickly so when you see a problem and say this problem is exacerbated by this rule we need to get rid of this quickly that there's that ability without putting people in a you know if you go out and say hey coal industry animal\nAdult is I don't drink and then to you know six months when he got no forget to take all the filtering back out or or any industry the banking industry you got to have everybody sign is formed no forget about that don't do it I understand the whip saw fact\nBut is there a way to quickly respond when either the private sector or the government sees something that's a problem and they realized the only way to fix it does get rid of that rule oh I'm Sorry that's a very long involve process center we won't be able to do that what can we do to balance those two needs\nRight well as you know and as they say the constitution isn't perfect but it's better than what we have now yeah the problem we have with this administrative state is that you do have these unelected agencies that are making those rules and the first place what a lot of proposals are and there's legislation to do this and the house has passed that\nI I guess I guess if you all the talk that regulation ... you know the house has done its job it's passed several regulatory reform bills it's just the Senate in this environment you can't even begin to get anything earth\nBut what you have to do is win or lose complicated or win or lose costly Congress needs to approve that rule that's the only thing that is going to\nBe able to give the certainty that ... that are the businesses need you know they often said there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty but sometimes just the certainty you know these regulations\nAnd we were having a heck of a time for over a decade with these net neutrality rules so you've got to have if law making is going to take place and especially in frontier sectors that are changing so fast like\nDrones driverless cars and ... robotics and artificial intelligence and cybersecurity you've gotta have Congress\nMade clear rules we can't have on a lesson agencies doing that no\nWe can't Wayne thank you very much Wayne cruises the vice president for\nThis is the vice

... thirty three\nHall customers are welcome here and even if you're packing heat is even on one of those seven five and twelve sixteen ... me [noise]\nI'll come back from Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Thursday evening we try to talk about all the issues in front of America\nAnd for the last several weeks cabin on four to bend the big dominant topic but I thought we talking about a few other important issues while we've got the time John Tammany is the director of the center for economic freedom it freedomworks and author of the book the end of work John it's good to have you on the program again thanks\nA large grapes beer thanks for having me on\nYou know that the Federal Reserve gets under people's skin and it it gets under my skin as well and there have been times I've heard from people who say let's just get rid of all together and I've I've said well I'm not sure we need to get rid of it altogether but I mean it certainly should be reined in\nBut is there a way that we can get by without a a bank of last resort in the form of the Federal Reserve because I'd love to get to a private sector solution to that\n[noise] oh yeah well without question or the fed exists as a lender of last resort as you just put it but what can't be stressed enough is that it's unheard of\nFor a solvent bank to ever go to the fed furlough it gets to you so isn't the mission of bankruptcy and what that means the federal leagues is to loan to insolvent thanks which is not what it's supposed to do so we don't need it for that the feds also bank regulator\nBut if you're a bank regulator that usually means you couldn't get a job that are real\nThe job at a real bad as we saw him a thousand eight\nThe fed was said had no clue about the problems with and banks and so it can't do a good job there\nAnd then it aims to target the overnight rate which banks lend to one another you know and interest rates of price like any other you don't need the fed for that so I think this notion that the fed serves some useful essential purpose is easy to disapprove we could get rid of it and most wouldn't notice it at all\nIn fact I don't particularly like the fact that they regulate the interest rate that they're not that the federal government views them as a way\nTo when the economy starts to heat up\nThat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates artificially outside of market forces and say we need to cool it down and in theory there the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold that they come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially\nTo try to pump it back up again I don't like that either even though I'm I'm well aware of the positive effects that has for some people I think it's a terrible I Would rather have the price to be like the price of gasoline or the price of oil or the price of any other commodity because really at the end of the day money's just another commodity isn't it\nAll yeah yeah absolutely and and what ... what should be stressed there is the is that the fed can't really alter the price of credit or why do we borrow money we borrow money because it can be exchanged for real resources like trucks tractors computers desk chairs buildings\nOr labor laws specifically and so it's a reminder that we create\nThe credit we create the resources that people are looking to borrow and they borrow money and so this idea that the fed can just decree the cost of credit cheap\nIs as silly as the mayor of Portland saying okay the top of mount that you can charge for a apartment rentals in Portland is a hundred dollars a month okay will demand for for those rentals would be high but supply it would be non existent\nThe fed can't decree resources cheap so I think even there we give the fed way too much credit this idea that it can heat up the economy and slow it down I don't take very seriously\nSo is there an and I don't either because you know all the way through from away when the initial you know we fell off the edge of the cliff\nAnd all the way to June of nine one officially the recession was over I like to remind people of that because they want to credit Obama with fixing the uh you know the the recession I say really you fixed it between January twenty up in the middle of June that's pretty amazing he didn't have time to do anything what did he do exactly\nAnd they say well you know you fix the economy well he didn't but their idea was will drop the interest rates low enough\nTo zero or or even below zero so that will pump the economy back up again clearly\nYou didn't do over eight years what Trump is management regulatory reform and tax reform over just a couple of years so I don't buy that one either one of the best way than to sort of back down and start to dismantle this uh you know this role that the\nFed has if we can get the political will to do that and speak to that too if you don't mind\nWell let's let's hit on a couple of those things is is that are crucial\nFor one the recession was the sign of the recovery\nA recession it's clearly signals and economy cleansing itself misuse of labor the bad habits develop a lousy companies the fatty vestments and so when you get out of the way of the recession\nYour setting the stage for the recovery and so that's the first thing I Would say a ... president get the best thing a president can do is just do nothing and then then you have your recovery\nUm\nIn terms of dismantling the fed\nAgain I I think you just decide you prove why we don't need it the fed can't make credit inexpensive it can't push the the rate to zero and suddenly you think that that's resources oh the ... that's going to say the resource ... is everyone thinks the fed can make that so\nNo no more no more than the fed could control the economy by saying well if things are bad let's drop the price of oil the ten bucks a barrel and then the economy will take off like a rocket because gas and diesel will be cheaper and that's where the economy runs on no they can't do and and\nAnd so you nail it you hit it on the head so the fed could never say OK oil is going to be cheap\nNow an oil and and make oil plentiful by saying that what the fed would do if it could\nJohn I lost you there for justice are going to use the way you want to do you have dropped out for a certain\nOh I'm Sorry the fed the fed setting the price of oil and with the ... oil scarce they're just wouldn't be any oil to buy and so implicit in and pushing the interest rate down to zero is that the fed can decree all resources near cost less\nAccess which we know logical you cannot do and so dismantle the fed yeah St Louis the obvious what could possibly do to stimulate or help the economy it quite simply cannot do what its critics and supporters alike believe it can\nSo more than just who wants to keep it around drawn\nOh I I think you and I know exactly who wants to keep it around the fed is a convenient whipping boy for Congress\nEnded up convenient whipping boy for the president any time we have a recession which is again a sign of an economy cleansing itself of of what's not working\nCongress want someone to point to as soon as the president oh the fed raise interest rates the fed tighten credit the fed could no more credit than then again the fed could could make it difficult to buy oil\nThese prices are set in the market and so we're always going to have the Federal Reserve around because Congress has a constituency and the banking system they want something to prop up what makes no sense during times of stress but they also want someone to blame and so\nYou know I say get rid of the fed makes serves no purpose I think we operate its power one way or the other four never going to get rid of it is Congress wants someone to point to when their policies are working\nWell I I guess and you know you you kind of leave me with an answer John because I uh I'd ... I'd like to get rid of it and I'd like to know what it would take to incentive I ... in ... Congress or if it turns the function of belong them a whipping boy looks at them up or [laughter]\nSomething that they can beat on every time the economy isn't doing with their constituents one but let's get rid of this thing that serves no purpose and frankly as kind of a disturbing effect on the rest of us\nUm look I couldn't agree more ah my second book not to plug it has called who needs the fed in which I make a case that the fed is is is rushing toward irrelevance it needs to be shut down but I I add\nIf Congress won't do this markets are shutting down the fed forest they're increasingly making what makes no sense not very relevant but I agree with you I think Congress should have the courage\nTo say we don't need this and in fact if it serves any purpose at all it serves a purpose that weakens overall economic activity that weakens the banking system that that that delays recovery is that our rights that are are\nRealize what's happening they they send about five men after him including one officer\nAnd your kids out of ammunition with his rifle and he pulls out his forty five pistol and shoots the last man in the row down in the front man and just keeps going\nHe just knocks them down and you know it's a really remarkable is your story as it sounds so we're leaving fills twenty eight men\nBut they did about ten years ago they went back to use Oregon and they'd get battlefield archeology on the spot that that you know York made this [noise] this incredible uh stand if you will and they found\nA forty five cartridges over forty of them along with his thirty six ammunition in that exact spot\nAnd and you wrote that as you went you know he told his men because this was a guy as you said the mountains in fact there's a great old movie in which he's portrayed and are they talking about what I recommend it oh it's a great movie I mean it's an old movie is not ... if I remember right who was Gary Cooper in black and white ones in it\nIt was it was Nineteen forty one and it won a number of awards and uh it's really a wonderful movie and it's worth you know where's the beef visiting yeah you know your listeners out there go watch it again it's a great movie\nHe's a great strategist as well because you wrote that all the officers were dead so he takes command as a corporal and then when he finishes shooting a bunch of these machine guns in the head every time I had come up I'd done knocked down and he said\nAnd then you said he went right down the position points is forty five at the Germans hadn't says tell your men to stop firing the German blow the whistle on up and down the line all the enemy soldiers stop firing\nThey just stop [noise] they stop and it's a it's incredible they he captures with along with some of the men in his patrol over a hundred and thirty Germans\nAnd they marched in back you know miraculously back to American lines and I wrote a piece of Breitbart on Sunday where the commanding general says well York I hear you capture the whole damn serving army [laughter] any sort of laughed it off as I got a few\nA few hundred and thirty two and edited\nYes this is the kind of story that I Want Americans to remember because you know we're used to go on to the movies and seeing you know stories of the single man or a single woman who can run out there and do amazing feeds on his own but this is a guy who actually did it for real and as I recall the story because after I watched the movie and this is a while back a year or two ago\nI went back and read the history of the real history of the man when he came back he was kind of surprised that the I I think the community built um a house\nYou know he was he was not a wealthy guy who was it was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but his community was very grateful for what he had done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and and he was just a symbol guy wasn't he\nHe was he didn't want to monetize\nThe experience and I think that that makes him so exceptional it's\nYou know ... you look at today where people are ... are constantly trying to you know they would create a reality show around this York didn't want that\nAnd I think that that's what makes him exceptional along with that generation of Americans which no one hundred years later and they're largely forgotten but they're going to capture them in the unknowns the book I just wrote\nIn and that's why I wrote the book I wanted to let the Americans know about this generation and how important it is and how they changed the world\nAnd in fact if if if nothing else I guess maybe he was ... didn't they create a weapon system that was the York\nThere the sergeant York the yeah the there's an M. sixteens that apple anti aircraft guns are attached to it\nBut they called the sergeant York I recall that as well now I Want people to see this book can you sketch out in thirty seconds what you've

Twitter at chip underscore Patterson also check out the twenty four seven sports college football podcast host and ship the narrative heading into last week was Stanford was the best to pack twelve has offer is everyone forgetting about Washington\nMay be but we also seen Washington right ... you saw Washington a habit offensive miss cues and and struggle to convert touchdowns and the red zone against an offered a team that\nNow we have changed our own opinion or that the sovereign team has gone into the season so Washington it's fallen below the radar yes but they maintain the inside position on winning the pack twelve north and they are\nThe odds on favorite to win the patch world championships so Washington despite the loss to Auburn bill can accomplish all of its goals and be in the conversation for the college football playoff but\nIn terms of the national conversation I think that there was an opportunity law\nAgainst Auburn and it's going to have to be nothing else that accumulating when that's going to be able to get everyone back in because you know the Utah game not particularly ... pleasing\nThe IRS in state game to the late charge from the sun devil probably went under the radar but you know if you were just checking scores on Sunday Morning\nNothing there that's going to jump out at you the only thing that Washington can do right now to accumulate to get more national attention and more respect from the outside it's just to continue to win because I don't think this team has built to blow anyone out I think that this team arrived on the fence\nAnd that defense is good enough to go when the pack to a championship\nBut again after the ... law and with everything that ...\nAuburn law and with everything that Auburn has done since ... you're just going to have to go proven\nColorado is it an easy job and it's hard to look away from their speed and big play potential October will be a very big bumps to the Buffalo's how do you think they come out of it\nI think that they're going to have to ah they're going to have\nTo really level up and and catch fire a little bit because the foreigners start\n'em on paper\nGive you a lot of confidence that this team's going to be able to go in and take charge and and when the pack twelve south but\nThey're good enough or with Stephen Montoya isn't it like Montana isn't shouldn't all might be one of the best quarterback wide receiver due out in the entire country and I I have a an idea that Colorado again if Colorado get hot and goes on a raw and\nThey can win the pack twelve south but I Do think that there are still some deficiencies with this team and that's what that's what makes the the Arizona State game so big and this one's just an incredible opportunity for the buck because if they win that game that\nCrucial in division when you start to accumulate those because there's really not a game and the ... out where you don't think that Colorado is a out of it or they don't have a shot but there's also not a lot of games\nWhere you're looking at Colorado and saying okay they are definitely going to win that game against division opponent I think we're going to see a lot of packed

I don't know but but they've been really physical up front and they've got a really tough quarterback and ... that can grind out yards and eat a clock and\nSo you know if they were able to just sort of control the pace in and force Oklahoma to play on their terms just get a couple of stops here and there\nYeah they were going to have a chance and and sure enough they get they get a turnover early in the game I'm Brenda Joneses safety picks calorie off something he's used to seeing a they get a couple of stops along the way and they just eat a clock and\nThey held off the furious rally there but that this this is Texas team has got some tough this to him and uh I think that that's um I mean clearly there are some issues there with Oklahoma defensively but I really liked this Texas team and and really impressed with what they showed and and I think they've got a chance to win a lot of games the rest of the way\nSpeaking of winning a lot of games Alabama added again none of their games have been close those bar is Ohio State the only team\nThe rest of the way it's being and winning a lot of games Alabama added again none of their games have been closed those bar is Ohio State the only team that can maybe not challenge them or is there or is there more right now\nYou know I'll tell you the the two teams that I actually kind of think might be the most equipped\nTo challenge Alabama I think maybe in the SEC I think one is playing a day in and trying to get out of the swap alive in LSU and the other one is is out east with the University of Georgia and I say that because I I think that there's a\nA few qualities you got to have to be able to be this Alabama team I think you've got to have a really good office of live\nOr both of those teams do a lot of states allies not bad I I just don't know if it's good enough and you got to have a an elite defense on all three levels the line line backer and the secondary we've seen some issues with Ohio State and in the back in ... in the ... corps and into secondary they've given up some big place it's not a good recipe\nAgainst Alabama and then I think the other thing is you got to have\nConfidence level that you can win and you gotta you gotta be really well coast they go out of state certainly really well coast but I think we saw Twain asking um struggled at times against Penn State in a hostile environment they won late but that was based on a lot of screens that quick games is letting those receivers do the work\nI think LSU in Georgia or the two teams that are competent enough edgy enough or athletic enough to sort of go into a game like that and not be scared off so I'm not convince anybody can beat Alabama but I I think if I'm betting on it and and that and you're telling me someone would I think it would be one of those duties and the FCC\nDog with ... of CBS Sports dot com I Want to go back to something you wrote about ah this past week and that was the aftermath of the Penn State Ohio State game James Franklin talking about his team being a great team but not an elite one how much of that is on him\n[noise] you know it's a good question I I I think I think his point and and the point I agree with is that he's actually taking them a long way and and he's helped them elevate to that level of great\nAnd I think as they started to elevate the program they've started recruited a higher level we've seen incremental progress progression from recruiting stand point to where now they're looking like a perennial top ten class and the incident towards the perennial top five recruiting level\nAnd when you're going to be an elite team it does take the little things like he talked about two feet Ohio State\nBut it also takes a talent level that you've got to work towards you don't get that talent level overnight they had to turn over the roster they had to rebuild the off into line\nAnd now all of a sudden they may just be one recruiting class away from having the kind of bodies like they've got really a leak layers that are freshmen\nThat aren't even playing and that's a good thing for Penn State that's not something that they're used to being able to do is not a lecture they've they've had the past\nFree shipping and twenty five percent off your next order there's no better time to shop visit the company store dot com and enter family Eighteen I check out for twenty five percent off plus free shipping from our family to yours that company store dot com\nYour home for Washington Nationals baseball ... one of those seven five eight and twelve succeed WC age ... am and FM Charlottesville [noise]\nWC H ve time five o'clock hunting Dotson with WC H.

troops are heroes and thirty percent said that no members deserve that accolades\nNow in Great Britain it fell between the two there are thirty two percent of those surveyed said all troops are heroes well forty nine percent said that somewhere he rose based on what they did\nThe Hugo polls conducted this year between July and September these three countries you had asked respond it's whether troops should be considered heroes and if so which ones qualified\nThe sharp distinction between Germany and the U.S underscores how vastly different the military's role is in each country it also suggests the challenge German politicians faced increasing defense expenditures to meet NATO spending guidelines a sharp point of contention between Berlin and the Trump Administration\nIn Germany shortfalls and military manpower has some political factions flirting with the idea of recruiting other European nationals into the German army I guess these will be mercenaries who are not typically reliable 'cause their loyalties for sale\nWhile nearly a third of Germans withhold their hero designation from all their fighters only five percent of those in America said no troops are heroes and ... percent said they didn't know\nThe numbers demonstrated a tendency in the U.S military members on a pedestal a two thousand Seventeen Gallup poll found that Seventy two percent of Americans had confidence that our military the highest marks for any public institution\nHowever I have two thousand Fifteen book edited by current defense secretary Jim Mattis and Kori Schake entitled warriors as

soldiers should ever be described as he rose but Britain's were more likely to reserve high praise for troops are performed heroic acts with thirty two percent saying that demonstrated bravery should factor into the equation\nAmbivalence among Germans could be linked to their country's Nazi past and the eventual defeat in World War two twenty five percent of Germans green Eighteen and twenty nine

friends where a medal of honor have done there is no question that our medal of honor recipients are heroes if they are heroes and there are no heroes\nIn virtually every case when I've discussed brave acts with men who have done them in combat I've found that none felt that they were heros\nAs I felt virtually all of them felt that we just did what needed to be done yes it was dangerous but it needed doing and that's what we're there to do in some cases the challenges dealt with in a few minutes others took days\nSo should we honor those who act bravely in or out of combat yes absolutely we should and our military has a number of metals to do that you just might want to learn what military medals stand for so who is a hero I'll leave that up to you and those are my comments were

two thousand nine took down to brass and Miami back to back again I said it before not as many opportunities as I would've expected botch the short answer a question for you three guys is what what a wind mean tonight for this program like why don't you start well I I think\nWhen you look at Notre Dame their national brand so obviously I think it would be a huge\nFeathering the boot camp yeah right I mean because I'm just trying to get to where a lot of people are and it's a slow process he's trying to get his godson place but I mean Notre Dame is a top six team in the country so this would be a signature wind for him\nAnd Notre Dame as a team that everybody feels like it's going to go the wells college playoffs and when you look at the rest of their schedule this might be the best chance for them to lose 'cause they only get to home games left but some of those neutral site games but this could be the challenge for Notre Dame so I think it'd be a huge win\nFor coach Wednesday and from Virginia Tech and that kind of tells everybody that hey we're back and maybe we're back faster than people thought\nEddie [noise] yeah I think a ... it'll be huge for us to show that that ... game wasn't who Virginia Tech is a now we've got everybody watching the whole country's Washington watching and they'll get to see Virginia Tech football I think we've got to go out and play\nGood special teams hard nosed defense run the ball and do those little things but it'll show everybody that this is a football school we all know it here but it's time to prove to everybody else branded\nI think the word that describes his game we get a win is respect we always have great respect your ... and right now everybody's question in Whistler the state of flu was you know these easy game like William and Mary so to say I'm the way we won the game was not convinced it will get respect back we went in game on a primetime staging as noted that\nI Want to throw in a bonus question here to staff all of a sudden is not new\nTo big time games right there was the ... there was the Clemson game last year they've been through these environments players what do you want from your coach on a night like this whether it's to amp you up whether it's to calm you down and focus you win what do you think coach ... trying to communicate to his guys going into this one\nMyself as a player I Would love but Marcos and big games just to stay aggressive you know when it's forced into this magic still go let's go for the defense of come back out and gives you the ball back just stay aggressive the drilling is going to be going everybody's going to want to make plays around as football field will just give us a chance to make like\nYeah and I think it means staying calm I mean being who you are the whole season are not getting\nFlustered are nervous or overly excited because we all look to the coach for guidance we all look to him when something bad goes goes wrong or something good happens you look to him as the the motivator to leader and so just stay the same state of course and just be who you are to host season law you know who's got a great\nPulse on this team and he kind of knows when they need to be pumped up and when I Need to go like kick back a little bit but I'll say this Thursday after practice right over there and indoor facility he told those guys look you guys got to be ready to play from play one and you don't get ready\nAnd when the need to kick back a little bit but I'll say this Thursday after practice right over there and indoor facility he told those guys look you guys got to be ready to play from play one and you don't get ready just when you go out on the field you got to be ready for the rest of this week they says everything is open for us in the ...\nYou said we're going to be aggressive if we got it I don't care if we lose he said well we're going to be aggressive Bruno call every play in the book if we have to want to need to [noise]\nAll right talking about motivation that leads us to question number two it's a multiple choice questions guys this week Notre Dame off ... I don't know if you saw this one Liam Aitken bird\nSet on I think it might have been Twitter or he was asked at a media session in throwaway Liam Aitken Bergen office of climate for Notre Dame said it's going to be loud\nBut our stadium beating Notre Dame is loud too I'm excited to go into lane kicked the blank out of them get a win and get out of there how do you think the players reacted to that a really motivated by it the kind of motivated she didn't care or D didn't see what we think\nIt all the way okay I Am a famous he motivated me right now I have well if I Want us to do it right now I'm trying to calm down over here on my way you\nKnow the the player there they're ready to go I think the fans also took that personal so that does that have let them know who's the loudest stadium in America if no stadium lightly especially not a Notre Dame state and when it comes to crowd intent state and so this is back it up and I\nI agree I mean it's different for every player

challenge in front of us\nWith all due respect to the atmosphere against William and Mary which was tremendous a game you guys when much has been made of Notre Dame coming into this cauldron for the first time but this will also be the first time that a lot of your guys experienced the night game atmosphere how do you balance that adrenalin with discipline\n[noise] well I think you know it's it should be a positive for us we've we've been on the road and hostile environments already with this young squad and\nTo get to have it cheering for us I think we just got to maintain our focus and continue to play the next place you know that's a something at times we've done well and at times we haven't done well and we know going in I mean we're playing a\nSuper talented team there's going to be some ups and downs I mean it's not going to be Seventy five to nothing we know the the the other team's going to make some plays and\nYou know handling that and and getting governor of up in and taken a swing on the next players what we're going to stay focused on let's look at\nAnd you know handling that and and getting gathering herself up in and taken a swing on the next plays what we're going to stay focused on\nLet's look at the Irish now coach again as I mentioned Huggies you take them up there two years ago and when and come back fashion some of the names the same but the dynamics of both teams really seem like they've turned over quite a bit what are you seeing from this Irish team that you prepare for this week as contrasted to that Irish team\nWell I I think they're they're more talented certainly across the board they're much better defensive team I thought that team two years ago was really good on off ants\nUm and you know I'm not as good defensively this year there um comparable on both sides of the ball um you know very really made a wise choice I guess you could say and switching their quarterback has really ignited them all fence of late in the last two weeks dramatically increasing\nTheir scoring numbers and in their their defensive\nUm numbers have stayed the same consistently throughout the season the foreigners ... nobody's scorn where many points\nLet's stick with that defense in terms of what they like to do seemed like a lot up to this point of the year they force you to move methodically down the field with that too high look that has been played against you quite a bit before\nYeah it'll be interesting to see you know we've gotten people out of that pretty quickly uh so far this year and and really force their hand into playing some some type of coverage and\nA lot in the box last week um it was just a couple of series and the game before I'm Duke in my estimation made a conscious decision to just to to put everybody down there\nIt'd be interesting to see if we can get them out of it\nUm [noise] get up get Notre Dame out of the two outlooks and there'll be a lot of coverage again they're really good in the back in this era front so I Would anticipate um them contesting everything that that we try and throughout\nYou mentioned it briefly there the decision made by coach brand Kelly to switch quarterbacks from Brandon Winbush to Ian Book and as you said they often has been rolling pretty good the last couple of weeks what specifically are you noticing and the extra dimension that he's brought to that often but I think\nI anticipated turning the film on and just seeing a guy standing in the pocket thrown in all over the yard\nSigns exactly what I saw you know I think um you know she has made plays with his feet as well you know he's a maybe not quarterback run\nWise but I'm In the pocket escaping the pocket keeping plays alive keeping his eyes down field scrambling for a positive play a when nothing's there seems to keep 'em on the chains and then they've got so much talent around them and they're running back has come back from a suspension and was\nFantastic last week versus Stanford and a really kind of put their their off into overdrive\nThey also try to get beat the on off and sometimes it seems three four tight and looks how does that force you to shovel your personal\nWell will probably stay with the with the with the ah with our base personnel group they do do some stuff with some to tighten looks and ran the ball very well against is a very physical Stanford front seven so they're going to push the temple as well you know this\nThis coordinators kind of from the Arizona State might nor avail tree and uh they like to they like to push to push the tempo and and throw it around but it's all centered around a really efficient run game\nJoined by head coach Justin ... extended pre game coverage continues coach just a couple of more ... big day here in Blacksburg obviously centered around this match up with Notre Dame but also a big unveiling a monument to your predecessor coach Frank Beamer just wanted you to give you the opportunity to discuss the importance of that to the program as it's presently\nWell I think it's another a fantastic\nBeamer just wanted you to give you the opportunity to discuss the importance of that to the program as it's presently\n[noise] well I just think it's another a fantastic opportunity for everybody to to say thank you and recognize coach for all but he's accomplished here [noise] um I think the monument is a well thought out in terms of the way it looks and\nUm you know kind of how it's been laid out um I Know I talked to coach a little bit this week and you know is exact words were I never thought in a million years that that they do something like this and just typical of of who he is and and why we're all um feel so strongly about him\nBut foster the opposite approach asked him what it should look like and he said well I should probably be crouching down along [laughter] they've been through without a doubt it well obviously honoring the past the foundation\nEstablished that you're now building
