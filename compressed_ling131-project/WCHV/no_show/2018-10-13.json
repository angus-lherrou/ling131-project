never occurred to them let me give you a couple of numbers to evaluate that\nI'm going to give you a first the net worth of three individuals before they became president and then I'll give you the net worth of those individuals\nAfter they left the presidency Donald Trump came into the presidency with a net worth of four point five billion dollars\nRock Obama came in worth about three million largely a house in Chicago in a few other things\nAnd the Clintons came into the presidency Bill Clinton's presidency with less than half a million bucks in net worth I mean the fact is the Clinton family had spent most of its life\nIn public housing before that you know living in the governor's mansion in Arkansas and that sort of thing now compare that with today Trump comes in worth four point five billion today his estimated net worth is three billion dollars\nThirty percent lower one and a half billion dollars less now he's still president we don't know what's gonna happen after his second term because I think he's going to get a second term\nBlock Obama came in with three million dollars net worth what's his net worth today\nForty million dollars Thirteen times as much money as he came in with the Clintons came in as I said worth less than half a million dollars they're estimated net worth today is a hundred million dollars to a hundred times what they came in with just consider\nIs Donald Trump the guy who's trying to steal your money or make things more unequal he's actually lost money by being president of the United states and not a small some\nOne and a half billion dollars so far you say well he'll probably make it up later\nYou're all these stories about well he's he's got Saudi ambassadors who are renting rooms and the Trump Hotel yeah I have a feeling

[noise]\nAmendment friday night you know a few years ago she ... and I\nGot to do something that I look forward to the opportunity to do for a long long time but\nI got a chance to go down to Mississippi and try to help them and become a United States senator\nAnd it didn't happen that time and I think honestly the man was cheated out of an opportunity a by a senator who labeled himself a Republican but actually acted more like a Democrat\nWell Senator Chris McDaniel is back at it he is now a Mississippi State senator who is running for the United States Senate and he joins Mennonite a Senator Mitch Daniels state senator Mitch Daniels it's good to have you back on the program and uh I Want to see this one come out differently if you don't mind\nYeah absolutely and thank you for having four years ago we we had that race and you remember what happened to ... we thought the good side of the night of the primary we want fifty nine percent of the Republican votes but because it's genetic as\nThey pushed forty thousand Democrat the typical public ... area of the Democrats elected\nOur nominee and then as you do have established networks they can't they just right for us to talk with to step down and they had selected another Democrat for the seat so here we are back in a very similar\nBack in a very similar setting fight here at the city so it's really great to be or\nWould you mind you explain to my audience how it is this complicated the Mississippi ends up with a system in which Republicans can have their choices taken away from them by Democrats across the aisle\nYou know what's remarkable we have this very conservative state and all these joke of the campaign trail if you can't find a conservative to since the United States Senate from Mississippi where you got to find one it's not going to be from Massachusetts California it's good and safe but what happens here\nWe have a large lobbying presents because of Haley Barbour another is that the party and\nThey will keep that gravy train ... what they do is they find a\nThese are so called Republicans who are really\nBig government Republicans they believe in big\nSpending big tax CNN and other liberal concepts but they hide behind that are on the Mississippi over the years we've always managed to health conscious individual and yet we still remain dead last economically speaking so or just in this another direction we think that the state can do better we know it can't\nJust do away with the good old boy club with a lobbyist and the cronies and reimpose liberties for everybody and that's what we're trying to do\nSo how's the race going at this point one of the polls show\nVery well the polls are all over the place I mean I you know what do you do a poll I'm Donald Trump we told they told us he had an ... percent chance of losing any one show\nOr some polls have us up a there's a pack poll shows us up eight to ten years or NBC poll shows us down five other polls are being whispered about that show up two or three\nWho knows what I Do know that we have all the momentum and the reason I Know that is we can feel the buzz on the ground and guess what will run against someone who was a life time Democrats you served three terms in the states it as a Democrat she voted for Hillary Clinton\nHas this all Democrats that grounded fact before she came back to ... ran for state Senate she was a federal law BSN she lobbied to help to organization that pushed for Obamacare and push for universal healthcare so when people find that out about the appointed senator guess\nWhat they rush away in droves and they run toward our campaign that's the only conservative and the great so as long as we're spread that message that people here in it where when it\nSo tell me this is a columnist recently said that your star is fading so I'm gonna tell me how you've closed the gap between now and election day\nWe got to drive a we have to drive interest is obviously there's an ethical pulled up there are there is also just a a a a person a individual component there were people have to talk to their neighbors make phone calls and inspired Mississippi is get out to vote and I would disagree that the story stating\nThe establishment spent ... million dollars in negative I Can't speak it twenty fourteen\nThey had a billion dollars it at this time to be so Fifteen million dollars in negative money in a small state like Mississippi all to drive me away\nAnd what's the big problem I'm a conservative I'm trying to hold them accountable and they don't want to be held accountable I don't think stars going anywhere as long as the people on a champion the ... I'm going to be that guy\nTell me this do you think that the Kavanaugh hearings are going to have any kind of effect because I I understand that there were senators who they are a lot of the focus on Murkowski and flake and Collins and fast and and yet\nI also wondered about the effect that it was going to have when people and especially conservatives like Mississippi looked at this even if you're a Democrat and a bit conservative and you said gosh I don't want my son or daughter held to this kind of standard\nThere were a single false accusation with such thin evidence even ... it was basically her story and her story largely incomplete I Wonder whether that's going to have any kind of effect on the electrodes Mississippi\nWill I Hope that it does help the people of our state come to the conclusion that the Democrats have go completely\nI'm completely to the well the other words they launched so far left with their more socialist now that they are Democrat more radical than they are moderate and frankly it's a dangerous party\nAnd if we don't find Republicans that can stand in the gap but not just Republicans conservatives that standard the gal to push back against that party we're going to lose this country so we always argue the days of reaching across the aisle or over the days of chastened in the class to the left or over we have to stand in the ... the only force this government that the plight\nBack toward liberty back where it belongs to lose this country so I Hope people recognize how dangerous that party has become and how much we have to fight to preserve our way of life\nI'm Talking to a state senator Chris McDaniel who's running for the United States Senate from Mississippi so how can people help you out financially because I Know in these closing weeks of the campaign a lot of money gets spent and often times like it or not money makes the difference because of advertising and get out\nThe vote yes there is a big deal to she's out spin and us right now probably Fifteen to one she's got all the ... money ... money in the U.S chamber of commerce suspended buddies out here trying to save her we just need you to help us you guys out there as the\nNext Daniel twenty eight team dot com go to Daniel twenty Eighteen dot com you'll see my plant or what I Believe that\nAnd if you get a chance please come help us Mississippi would love to have a conservative US Senator and I promise you will fight for everybody\nAll right Chris one last thing and that is let's assume you become the next US Senator from the state of Mississippi I'd be pleased by that because I'd love to see you get there I I got the right values and and I I fully endorse your candidacy but but tell me the circadian what are you going to be your top priorities is a brand new limited US Senator\nFate and the ... we have to build that border wall has to be funded number two term limit ... it's just time to shock the system that bring some of these career politicians hold\nAnd lastly and every vote that I cast but every speech that ... we have to de centralized the power of the federal government at bringing those powers back to the states it back to the people with those powers always blown the government is broken it's dysfunctional it's disconnected I'm sick a career politician\nIs how to put the people charged again and that's with every boat that we cast we have to restructure this government\nChris it's a pleasure I it was a pleasure to help you four years ago and my help wasn't nearly enough I Hope that this time the next time I talk to you after the November election that you are the next US Senator from Mississippi\nThank you so that means a lot to make just keep your prayers and uh I look forward to working we did get one day thank you for everything\nI look forward to a Senator Chris McDaniel is who's now a state senator running for the United States Senate glad to get your calls at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven and if you want to measure of where America is going right now consider the me too movement\nConsider the movements that openly opposed the choice of American voters in President Donald Trump and then consider this brand new poll reason magazine talks about it they asked Americans about political correctness now\nYou might get slightly different definitions of what political correctness is but I think we all understand it and it's like the old definition from the Supreme Court justice of obscenity I Can't define it but I Know it when I see it\nThree fold greater than what he got just six or eight months before and then you say well where's your gun this year clearly he's been painted as a racist bigot for the last year and a half by the media\nHis ratings can't be very good no they're not eight percent they're not twenty three three times higher there's thirty five percent more than four times the support he got at the polls and sixteen\nAnd I think the left has looked at that and said\nWe're in trouble we bones these voters or at least that's their attitude I think toward black American voters we own these people and they're they're going off the reservation they are now supporting Trump I mean what are they going to say when it goes from thirty five percent\nTo say fifty percent by twenty twenty for the next election I think the Democratic party is going to lose its mind\nAll right so I Want to give you some data points to arm the the number of votes that for that block Obama got a in two thousand eight set a record for the number of blacks voting for Democrats [noise]\nIt was it had been approaching a higher and higher number from all the way from Ninety two to two thousand eight guess what\nWe've seen it go in the opposite direction rock Obama in two thousand twelve set a record for now\nRecord for nominee among black voters actually it's true for everybody but he's the only president to be successfully reelected and receive fewer black votes than he did when he was first elected\nSince Roosevelt you name the candidate whether it was a Republican or Democrat they always managed to get more black voters the second time around what did those black voters no well here's what we got to see in two thousand six days\nIf you just look at black men they gave Donald Trump\nThird team per cent of their vote if in fact black women had voted the same way\nThat black men did that would have been nearly a thirty year high the truth is we hadn't seen this divergence we didn't see it in two thousand twelve two thousand eight two thousand for this divergence\nYou gave me some stats that are accurate about the overall numbers there's been a spike among black men for Donald Trump and for rejecting progressive ism that most in the media aren't even wanting to talk about it has more than quadrupled\nWhile and you can imagine the effect tours all of us I think react this way if there's someone I highly respect\nWho comes out and says I'm In favor of something I'm not going to avoid that I Would ignore the facts on the ground\nI don't always support what those I admire also support but it's the facts are there and you know right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship for ... percent increase in the new black businesses in the last Eighteen months\nAnd then record low black unemployment and then a couple that with\nAdmirable figures for both black Americans in white Americans they are going to be people who look and say well Connie likes the guy may maybe I should too and that may just pushing them over and I think that's what the Democrats are so concerned about that they are losing what they thought was a guaranteed piece of their electorate\nIt was the message that everyone was supposed to understand don't worry about what you said don't worry about what you feel just believe if the progressive\nSocialist agenda is being pushed forward you're better off well here's an interesting data point three of the five worst unemployment data points for blacks occurred during the Obama administration guess what\nFive records for unemployment low is since the bureau of standards has been recording it within the department of labor\nFive have heard of the lowest unemployment now we have set records in America for the number of people in just the last Eighteen months who went on their first ever think family vacation than a decade\nYou are not easily going to be able to convince black people that\nThat doesn't matter and how do I know because Iraq Obama got fewer votes among black people\nWhen he was getting reelected they saw just like everyone else these policies\nDon't appear to work\nYou know they jump for us it's a pleasure to have you on

guess I could get program in an op ed on I have currently pay down three thousand dollar that\nUm that that actually that's the guy I was making paint it on my way pain they finally found\nUm now I Need to start on like that that will collection of what you're getting out of our knowledge mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of settlements in the mail mhm last like I had a federal king hundred dollar sale that there there are are\nFrom David take fattening hired for a friend of mine like very little that thousands of dollars that works for getting mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will\n... income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave\nCache of what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand a year\nOkay let's say let's say you're out and ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal\nWhat's your yeah your I have about\nTwo hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but if and the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April you know that you may have\nIn in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding well then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question\nThank you for joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money our question that comes from

legacy meeting with our family the meeting will consist of adults and miners\nHow often should we have these meetings and do we share specific dollar amounts with everyone or just share with each individual what will affect them\nAnnually would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their\nEarly twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot who we hit the lottery because I was for me and my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it [noise]\nSo they need to be emotionally immature and share it with him and we do it about once a year [noise] this is the day Ramsey show\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend a quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off all all of the non mortgage that a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside that wasn't nailed down in our house\nOn me when the show which flipped with you to his foot up doesn't it yes went from a whole whole spending stupid all the way over to a wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's a true one eighty\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ...

way we have seven that's awesome yeah so uh uh uh\nFive years ago you call him and say come home was ...\nWhat were the next\nI don't know I'm going to guess at a period of time three to four months like\nThis marriage is just hanging on by a thread and you say okay but let's try this together and we're not we're not going to spend like what you're spending how how did that next three to four months it looked like from the from the I mean almost gone\nTo we're going to turn and try there's there had it had to be pretty bumpy yeah\nOr was it was hard to trust her\nShe spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and in debt and\nAnd I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this\nI mean you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of\nHoly right away or is it grew yeah trust grew over time\nWell in that moment I got home from the class I was going through my doors ... trying to sell so I mean

lot of ways both families have two working parents with a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of her life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents died\nAnd that does happen there will being would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that

quits also we our health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers\nMhm and so what does your wife make er about thirty two thousand a year Mm\nAnd I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to ... for daycare on that win lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly yeah um I mean it's not going to be banned just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nComes out to eat pain because one will be an important you know kind of oh two babies okay yeah I'm\nAll right ah and what do you do for a living I'm In sales or my wife works for the state what do you sell a pest control in termite stuff like that mhm\nAnd that your company is a branch and the other city\nOh yeah ... throughout the state okay All right um well here's the wage which\nYeah here's a meeting I think I Would want to decide where idle Leo's based on some formula other than where the babysitter live\nYes\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Diane is on Facebook what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it\nWell a line of credit is an approved\nAlone\nThat you take out only when you would want to\nKnow where you could get pre approved and have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically\nA show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we try to take the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one would you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of that because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit\nAnd bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes like one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say\nA higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body for products forge build and a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on it I wouldn't do anything about that it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nOr of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing um but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought a drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so I was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't you know I Can't because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it it's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nTaking my call Sherman what's up I'm standing on a high school senior I've got about three thousand dollars and like I mean the count out donating should I invest in China then\nYou're going to college\nYeah I mean the college with a cause for entertainment and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service that type of a charity and I keep program at the community colleges is either and you know our first yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and a half to four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that okay so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever\nMhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus yeah um\nYou can invest it or here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really going to cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage\nUh with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study\nWhether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out\nAnd use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nGreat Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our growth take all of our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I ... that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we say ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now that the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that a a ... choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nAt the entrance of no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect guy I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension Bush stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] oh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we count as a for then that means we need to put in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood as I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent sort of put an end Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only are celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nThat's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us this is that I ...\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary

discoveries in hell on your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr bank is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contracting and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAs a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's the simplest calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition\nThat people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or\nHow many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nWill all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's in a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink this cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nThis is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for now ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd I want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain in stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you it's lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to ... formula only have to do\n... do you want to improve your heart health your digestive health and

with age\nCal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression for tea it's all in this very informative book and\nForget Chris I'm going to give away free by my count formula one

better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for every member you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael ... is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing differences are little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] Dr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this complex formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I ... a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back mhm and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula and I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour I was functional again\nNot wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period yeah and it it completely alleviated the problem now what about heart disease heart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah\nAnd if anyone has any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I ...\nBut every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had asked my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made\nIt out to her friends and that is amazing\nAnd when I use this with professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes he was in us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system well very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because the fish and in many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nIsn't something so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and

Dr Michael Pincus about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body weather's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how your kill max formula\nInformation\nThrough shows with a set time of\nYear when health care providers will mine does the flu season is on the way and joining us with some timely advice is Dr Lisa ... is senior director of infection prevention at the Johns Hopkins health system\nIn Baltimore, Maryland Dr influence or can obviously be deadly yet many people don't bother getting the vaccine how bad was the fatality rate last year\nUnfortunately we had a very severe and widespread influenza season last year\nThe season was quite bad enough varieties of ways we had a record number of out patient is that and is it to the emergency department for flu like symptoms there was a record number of hospitalization for flu like illness\nAnd also a record number of deaths the CDC or Centers for Disease Control and prevention estimate that there were over eighty thousand deaths that were in some way attributable to influenza that could be from the infection itself or sometimes patients die\nWith other causes such as a heart attack or a respiratory problem or a stroke that was around the time of having Lou and Lou may have contributed to that patient staff\nBut you don't necessarily have to get a shot now is that right there is another option\nYou're right there are different formulations that they influenza vaccine and one of those type is available as an intern nasal vaccination that doesn't require an injection that as an option certainly are people who have intact immune system they don't have any kind of immuno suppression\nAlong with the standard flu shots I understand there are what are called high dose shots for people over sixty five which federal about\nRight well as we age the immune system doesn't respond and quite as aggressive manner to vaccination and so\nThe high dose vaccination or older individuals is really in an attempt to give that bigger amount of anti and get the immune response that we'd like say\nSo there is a high dose vaccine sometimes that has a little bit more side effects meaning local irritation at the side of the infection but individuals should inquire about getting the high dose vaccine if they're concerned about really boosting the immune response to live\nWe're talking with Dr Lisa ... senior director of infection prevention at the Johns Hopkins health system in Baltimore, Maryland doctor is this right now we're we're speaking it's October is this the very best time to get a flu shot or is there a time when it's really too late to get it\nChris this is the perfect time to become vaccinated against influenza the goal is to become vaccinated before flu starts circulate it takes about two weeks for your immune system to respond to the vaccine and so that's why I'm sober it's such a great time\nGet your vaccine before we start seeing flu virus circulate but usually start sometime in November ... and then peaks in January or February ... the current CDC guidance as to complete vaccination by the end of October but to the second part of your question\nThere really isn't a time that would be too late so if for some reason someone doesn't get a vaccine and realizes even into the January February march timeframe\nI Would say go ahead and get that vaccine to protect yourself\nWhat do you say to someone who is just I got the vaccine last year but I still go\nAnd I would say go ahead and get that vaccine to protect yourself\nWhat do you say to someone who says I got the vaccine last year but I still got the flu\nWe hear that kind of complaint commonly that despite getting a flu vaccine is still got the flu there's a couple of reasons for that is the first reason might be that during respiratory viruses and lots of different viruses that are circulating\nAnd so many of us catch one or another of these types of viruses which may or may not be the blue\nSo the flu is generally a much more severe illness than the typical head cold or virus that you might get so that might be one reason that someone thought that they got sick\nEven though they got the flu vaccine the other reason is that\nThe flu vaccine is not perfect we are still doing a lot of research and development trying to come up with a better flu vaccine we know that last year for instance it was about forty percent effective it is possible to get the flu vaccine and they'll get this disease but the good news says it still does protect you\nAnd so overall even if you do get the flu you have a shorter illness and less chance of severe complications west\nWinter's flu season was as you mentioned earlier really bad dissent foretell a milder season this year or two we really predict\nIt's difficult to protect to how severe any given flu season that's going to be but one of the best tool if we have is to look to the southern hemisphere were there in St Lucie is an already and we have data from that if the attempt to kind of protect what's coming in the northern hemisphere\nAnd those data suggest that the coming flu season might be a bit milder this year thinkers cross\nExactly even if the flu is not serious I've heard that getting a flu shot kind of boost your immune system in general is that true\nWell the flu shot contains several strain of influenza most shots have at least three is not for strains of influenza a and influence to be so in that regard it is boosting your immune response to a variety of different viruses that circulate\nTypically at the beginning of flu season will stay influence a predominant and then later in the season we may see influenza B predominantly\nAlong with getting the flu vaccine what other tips do you have for people to avoid getting sick I assume one would be to wash your hands frequently but are there any other ideas you could shear\nSure a lot of these are just the very basics of infection prevention you've mentioned the most important which is hand hygiene cleaning your hands frequently during the day either with soap and water or using an alcohol based hand Rob\nAnd then some other things like really staying home when you're not feeling well and you have a fever we still see a lot of people who go to work with a tab rile respiratory illness than not just to a further ...\nAnd then not sharing utensils than drinking out of time in containers those kinds of things especially during respiratory virus the event\nAnd then finally what we call respiratory etiquette which involves things like sneezing into your elbow rather than onto your hand again doing hand hygiene and making sure that we have tissues and mass available for people who may need to come into\nThe doctor's office or other areas when they do have symptoms\nFor the parents who are listening right now what age is appropriate to give a child a flu shot\nAnyone over the age of six months is eligible to get the flu vaccine and that is the recommendation\nFor the younger children under six months they're really ...\nAges six months is eligible to get the flu vaccine and that is the recommendation\nFor the younger children under six months they're really depending on the rest of us get our vaccine now that we don't have a lot of flu around them\nWhile they're in that susceptible days there are as I mentioned a lot of other respiratory viruses though and one called respiratory ... virus R. R. S. C. is also circulating among children every year and unfortunately we don't have a vaccination for that illness\nFor those who say I've never gotten the flu shot I'm doing fine why should I really get one now what would you say to those people\nWell I guess my answer would be that live as an incredibly serious illness it killed tens of thousands of Americans every year we know that that is the circulates and wave of epidemic throughout these many months during respiratory virus isn't\nThat the fact that you didn't get it in the past doesn't predict the future and the flu vaccine pilots in perfect is the best tool we have right now to protect yourself from in the one that was the very fair to the it's the second thing I Would add\nIs that becoming vaccinated does protect others around you know if you don't want to do it for yourself think about ... ... people around here maybe family members are very young or who are older or who have underlying health conditions that they put them at risk for fear to these if they catch\nDr Lisa ... is senior director of infection prevention at the Johns Hopkins health system in Baltimore, Maryland Dr ... thanks so much for joining us today thank you for having me\nMixed is reading going out of style and social media use stores that story coming up and around there's more ...

music and uh it's so good just to feel that sun just like beaming down on my ... oh my skin and I would just suck it up that\nUh the vitamins or and or just a just a really enjoying it\nIt's it's I mean we we had about five or six days with no rain in the month of September or you share yeah\nI mean it's been it's been crazy and\nTo you if you follow the directions and you've got your ear eating and seeding done uh on one of those six days yes [laughter]\nBecause ah you're reaping rewards no doubt that or if you did a plant installation\nYou got some plants in the ground some side put down\nOr because you haven't had to do anything and and you're going to see it crashes Germany like crazy right now uh with the sunshine hitting at this next week yes ah and if you have not in fact we we've got to the majority of our lawns that we Erie and overseas for customers are worse\nHitting this next week yes ah in if you have not in fact we we've got I'd say the majority of our lawns that we Erie and oversee for customers and we're still going to be going hard at it this ... you know for the next couple of weeks trying to get everyone completed just because the rain has just brought everything to a screeching halt\nInstead of area and you're on the machine over it instead of instead of pulling of course it's more like killing yeah\nYeah what you can do a tremendous amount of damage Jess I if you do things when they the ground as as saturated as it is now right in fact there are several days where I was like okay it's kind of clear guys can we go out and do it and and everyone's like no carbon don't don't even\nDon't even sentence out there in the area and so as much as we'd like to get out to your home and and provide that service to you we don't want to leave and it looks like you know it looked like a\nLike a normal somebody wrote until your your lawn under and uh that wouldn't be good looks like to go first attack from Caddyshack right yes not wondering who in the neighbor who doesn't like me\nWhen we had a we had a one class that was you know was insistent that we come out there and then and do the area of the university and everything and and\nYou want to treat it with a [noise] or fungicides or something like a document ill and that will help to eliminate the damage for different next season I'm\nUp here yeah I was wondering if I recognize that I got that right now about what I really don't want to cut it out it's right in the middle of our yard [laughter]\nYeah but I Would you know the the the other key thing that I Would would kind of monitor going through the the\nRest of the fall and winter and into the early spring is just any of those ah twigs that you can reach from the from the ground or or what are just kind of do a scratch test on those um those twigs and branches see if there's a\nGreen tissue right up underneath the bark\nIs that uh that ... that the tree is still alive and and still ah otherwise healthy and and gonna leaf outcome springs if you if you scratching and several of them come back that they're ... they're just dry and brittle and and\nNo green up underneath the bark than then that's when I Would start to worry but as long as you got that green tissue\nRandom under the bark than uh you should be in good shape for spring\nOkay but it's still alive should make it but otherwise um to get rid of it\nRight right\nAnd then you know just take a take a real close look at the bark\nAnd\nAnd everything going you know starting to get the base of the tree and and working your way on up and it just make sure that you don't have evidence of holes in in you know like I saw dust around that it can be an indication that you've got some borders working on there as well\nOkay yeah I Know I Wonder if I didn't know what records go after every tree in the yard but that one\n[laughter] I don't know if they're not even that one alone that's a you know that's usually a good sign that there's not much insect activity going on in the tree so\nGood at least at least I can say that uh it would be nice 'cause it's a you know it's like the first trade wherever planet\nSure yeah you'd like\nTo hang onto it\nYeah it was like as in clean up the the um the leaf litter underneath the tree really really well this is this fall get all that stuff out of there and then I'm\nGoing to keep an eye on and make sure you got some good ... good live to shoo there and then hopefully springs you know he's a leaf out just fine in his leaves or are you know when they're doing the bus first start breaking in the least first started coming out\nTreated with a fungicides then in about every two weeks until the the leaves are fully emerged and that should go a long way to approach toward preventing this from happening again next year\nI F R I start to say it on a Japanese my ... I should just go ahead and treat them with the Congress like your guest right yes yeah\nI I was kind of hoping that was the St Michael I wasn't wasn't transfer but\nAnd and you know there's you don't see anywhere near as much of this on the Japanese maples as you do on on the others but uh just to be on the safe side 'cause you know they're they're valuable trees you don't want to do one\nYou're as much of this uh the Japanese maples as you do on the others but uh just to be on the safe side because you know they're they're valuable trees you know what to do and having impact them that you can avoid\nLike several of those that were you bought stuck underground it now they're saying oh I don't want to lose them\nRight yeah you want to do what you can to protect them\nAll right guys well you are I'm sure you're you're out cruising around a top I'll I'll uh I'll be over it sounds like things about for the for folks on North Carolina\nI already have you guys doing that again this weekend Tom\nYeah we're going to collect a a day for Wednesday and carry out on a\nThursday okay I'm In I'm do break down there distributing out of it as one out and protector of our place called\nLa ... well I'll just got a devastating\nThey have nothing they don't have a mother ever Crosby off now we're going to take another look up for quite a while now so\nThat's that's fantastic so that's all three locations again this weekend the Walmart in Rockville Sam's Club in Charlottesville and ... downtown\nJustice out are just going to stay on okay that's okay All right well that's good to know to do with my ... yeah do you know the hours are for that Tom a normal business hours at Sam's er and they uh\nUh except Sunday night and a six\nOkay that's great thank you so much for your service and all you're doing to help out those people down in North Carolina I'm actually heading down there was a big group on friday morning and it coming back Sunday night but we're going to do a\nDemolition and clean up in in a food distribution and all that all that also this weekend so maybe I'll see you down there I\nGuess they give me a bugs on your down there you got a phone number so are you married call on all the way we get together over down several friends already down there working on was America's first\nThat's awesome well thanks brother for all you do and uh appreciate your phone call and have a great day happy gardening to you\nI Can't even tell me what to do I'm not sure I got a lot to lose that\nYou're a You're welcome buddy have a great day\nCare\nMake you think of I Know that was Tom pounce calling in from a from Charlottesville I'm Glad we could answer his question thank you for all he does for our community or in terms of\nA fund raising in in the ... original founder of the uh the toy Dr ... and has done so much to help so many people over the course of his his life a great great man and again that's the the ... the collection for the hurricane relief efforts\nGoing on at Sam's Club today are from ten until eight PM and then that will be going on until ... I think he said when when they ran into wins they say if you like to drop off\nA any items um that they need I'm sure he would be much appreciated I Know I saw on the news that they've already filled several tractor trailer loads and truckloads of a relief aid a that's already been you know several trips to parties and loads of already been taken down so just one of the incredible\nUm\nCarnival opportunity to help those that are really in need and and had been left with nothing\nRegular you know we think about this being you know it's it's a couple of weeks have passed its you know we think the waters receded and everything he's on the ... no no yeah there's there rivers down there\nAll the week's ... past it's you know we think the waters receded and everything he's all about getting on the horrible no no yeah there's there rivers down there that are that are ... that still have not crusted yeah\nDown in in a particular down in South Carolina some of those rivers are still rising flooding is the is still getting worse and so it's this is going to be a long term relief effort to try to to get these people back on their feet\nHe'd like to join our conversation the phone lines are open at nine six for one zero seven five lead to hear from you this morning again nine six for ten Seventy five I\nTell you what you gave out of a bit of information I think is really invaluable when it comes to trees and shrubs and that is that scratch test\nWe talk about that all the time or when it comes to trees and shrubs but just getting out there if you've got a good fingernail on you you can take a fingernail and just in your thumb and just give it a little scratch I don't have any nails on my hands I usually use a\nA key now going to say yeah our our car she or you know just a little razor blade just something just to kind of puncture\nThat Trump just a little bit just to kind of scratch and see what's going on underneath\nThat that uh that first layer of of of tree tissue especially\nDuring the summer and fall months I Can't tell you how many trees that I've looked at in the past few weeks that uh you know I I got to look at replacements I got to look at you know a landscapes that we've installed and the first thing I Do\nBecause trees are are are funny are or are a funny thing they'll drop leaves at the sign of you know\nThe the first bit of stress that that they are under so one tree might be under stress and then ten feet down to you know in the yard the tree might be perfectly you know have all the foliage on it and be healthy but you scratch both of 'em and they're both just as green and and for all intents and purposes alive and doing well\nBut a underground maybe there's some circumstance or something that happened to that one particular tree that now do you fully aided\nOr that um you know some stress it was under and it causes it to shut it leaves and so we associate\nThat process of losing leaves with the trees got to be dead right but I Would say probably sixty Seventy percent of the time that's not the case of 'em and again if you just get out there to check that tree scratched the surface\nI it's a it's a real quick test it takes about two seconds and you can figure out exactly what kind of shape your tree is in a with you know again our instinct is get the chainsaw out you know cut that puppy down and uh let's plants a new one\nAnd in many cases and well that's not necessarily that yeah the tree still in great shape and or the the the shrub\nAnd you know there are a lot of different stresses that can can cause them to to lose ... that are very temporary yeah scenarios and this is just the the plants reaction to that stress and its survival mechanism is dish to shed those leave reduced the amount of of um\nEffort that it's got to put into to surviving in order to be able to consolidate its resources and and uh make it through to the next season so don't don't give up on just because I started losing leaves don't yeah All right I'm off a lot of times they do they come roaring back with with another you know I'm\nOut of your house and get it disposed of in a way that is environmentally responsible and safe what and isn't going to contaminate anything and maybe you know this ... what is that process what what do they do what ... what's the where's that stuff go and how do they\nDeal with it all well they they sort it all and you know categorize yeah of undecided insecticides and you know a level of hazard yeah\nStuff and then they've got pressed excuse me [noise] process is either to um you know in some cases I think some of it gets incinerated okay or you know otherwise dispose of that is that it it's not going to be a a a\nA risk to the environment yeah you'd think that suffer just throw it in the trash right\nIt take chances are going in a landfill somewhere and ... it's not going to be processed properly right and then it has the potential to become a a a hazard environmental hazard on down the line so this is a great way to get to taking care of it well you know what's going to be handled the right way\nOkay and that's going on you said today yesterday and just today right okay I\nJust like to join our conversation nine six for one zero seven five you're listening to the center of garden show let's go to the line and welcome Doug to the show good morning Doug you're on the snows garden show\nGood morning or are you guys doing great how about yourself\nPretty good at one very quick question sure I've got along that the Bermuda grass or work rash I Believe it's called an area that trial or to um\n[noise] ... grass or work rash ... it's called a military trial for or do you um are overtaking or a lawn and I was wondering uh if area ... will only aggravate the situation\nPotentially you can spread it a little bit by running ... through it um\nOf course you know anything that you do like that that makes the best you healthier is going to make the the wire grass or Bermuda healthier too yeah\nI mean one thing you've ... you've got working for you that may help is that you know the the wire grasp the Bermuda whatever you want to call it is getting you know on the verge of going doormen here and a few weeks a and so you mean you know maybe there's some thought again it's probably not going to check it out but\nThe more stand up fast you you can get in those areas ... grows more upright and tall you know in a healthy high to maintain your ... best you act is three to four inches and say if you can get that fast you growing up word and and\nAnd kinda not choking it out but uh if it cast in the shade on it and it creates more of a shady environment for that a wire grass the Bermuda grass isn't going to like that\nAnd I might might slow down some are ultimately you're probably just going to have a mix you are contaminated with a wire grass unless you get in there and get aggressive with it and you know in terms of spring it with a non selective herbicide like round up [noise] um you're probably just\nYou know you can slow down the process of it ever taking over a little bit but that you're not going to eradicate it I'm just by reading and seeding again you you're going to make your line a little bit healthier\nA you're going to get some new fast you coming up but I think ultimately you're still going to have a lawn and conflict of ah weeds you know the wire grass versus the tough ask you\nWhere are the only reason I was curious or I Want to area alone and then find out later that only\nIncreased the probability of regrets continuing spread\n\nYeah [noise] it probably doesn't penetrate deep enough to really get down to I mean you know you don't want I mean you know a typical core area there is only going to three inches a semi you're probably\nYou know you're probably not getting down to that in that zone where it's going to spread it immensely I mean you might get some and again\nAnd then you know the whatever gets pulled up in those corps is going to be small enough that it's got to be is going to really hit the right spot yeah to get the um the the viable notes from the the ... yeah the ...\nI'm I've got a lawn you know I stopped a trying to control the weeds you know a couple of years ago and I'm I'm kind of at the stage in my life where as long as it's green it's it's ... it's you\nKnow it's helping me with erosion control a and things like that I just try to keep my lawn healthy and as thick as as possible and so what happens this time of year is everyone who has that philosophy like I Do\nCrab grass wired grass all those different you know non says she grass to start to die off and you start to see him in the law you think you've got this you know beautiful green lush lawn until it the first freezing and it looks half half dead\nAnd so I wanted to benefit you can get\nAgain maybe if you're not a you know a lawn you know\nGoing for the golf course but it just won't want something that's healthy ... and it's going to look good by ear eating in seeding year lease replenishing\nOn you know going for the golf course but it just won't want something that's healthy ... and it's going to look good by ... conceding year lease replenishing and filling in some of those dead spots that are going to be showing up here in the next few weeks I when we get into a frost and freeze a with some of those grasses are going to die\nAnd so I I'm that's what I Do at my house I go out and I ... that seed and fertilize and try to get the fast food as healthy as I can\nUh but then I just kind of I don't worry long term about the wire grass I have too much lawn to to spray Ford and maintaining I'm not going for manicured golf course luck in and uh\nAnd so I think there's definitely a benefit to doing it to keeping your ... healthy and rejuvenating it in and getting new crop down every year or than long term will will pay off for you\nOr I just want us to to yeah use roundup thing is just like it just wouldn't work yeah I'm All right uh what later the chicken and you ... and ... after this remade a graph starch the turnover owners that truly\nDoes if you you know if you've got to this sounds like you've probably got a fairly wide open scenario not a lot of tree cover or anything like that that are good but dropping a lot of leaves right um yeah you ... the only the only real limiting factor it how late you do it\nIs later you do in the colder the air temperatures the colder the temperatures are the slower that seed is going to be to germinate so instead of being you know a pick a few days in his up taking a few weeks for the seat to jump up and and start growing\n... really the only limiting factor I mean you can have good German nation are doing it well into two ah November and December and even even January and February the conditions are right in the you know this little temperatures too cold\nI tell you what we're seeing some freaky fast German nation race right now with how warm it was back in August and then all this rain in September I'm seeing we're seeing German nation like four to four to six days\nRight uh you know grass like Germany and like coming up and so it's just incredibly quick right now the amount of ... ah how quick that termination processes\nAre but like you say that I I haven't done minding my house yet I'm waiting for things to try out a little bit uh I probably won't hit mine until mid to late October uh and you know I don't have that all the\nAll the trees are having the leaves are kind of fall on the outskirts of the property and I've got a lot open fields and stuff so I'm just you know wait until I can find a breaking the crew schedule to slip them out to my house for a couple of hours [laughter] but ah you know I ... I think you'll find waiting a few more weeks\nAnd and ... and by that but that stage you know typically historically have we have a frost freeze by mid to late October right so you know wait a few more weeks and then and then maybe get in there and do it\nWill take their ... to grass long term\nFor yeah you're exactly right All right thanks luck\nI dug visual Leslie thanks for your phone call and are happy garden too you have a great day\nYou're listening to the snow knows garden show on WC H ve we'll be right back for our final segment it's like to join our conversation nine six for one zero seven five the phones are open we'll be right back\nHard to believe we're entering the fourth quarter of twenty Eighteen already are you a local business do you participate in small business Saturday\nLocal like you and I would love to meet you share how we may be able to help your business optimize profitability this cue for through effective digital marketing as a family owned and local media group we look forward to help you this holiday season\nYour business optimized profitability this cue for through affective digital marketing as a family owned and local media group we look forward to help you use this holiday season we've contacted me James ... the director of digital marketing macho a media dot com today Dr will\nSunday on T.

the conversation as well it's eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nHow's this for a conspiracy theory we've actually used it as tonight's Twitter poll question we try to make a question out of each and every day's news and some days is more interesting than others but this one is intriguing should President Trump\nHas talked about Jeff Sessions possible replacement\nWith some obsessions subordinates now imagine this you're working at any job and the boss comes down and talk to people who work for you under you\nAnd he's saying who do you think we ought to replace Larson with when we get rid of them that kind of thing\nThe Washington Post the venerable Washington Post and left leaning so they're never going to paint Trump in a favorable light reports President Trump talked recently was Jeff Sessions' own chief of staff\nAbout replacing sections as attorney general according to people who've been briefed on the conversation signaling the president remains keenly interested\nIn getting rid of his top law enforcement officials the conversation between ... a Trump President Trump and Matthew would occur as seems somewhat nebulous it was not clear for example whether would occur would take on an interim\nJob as attorney general or be nominated in a more permanent capacity or how definitive the president's intentions were on a long list of indignities that session has endured from his boss Trump's discussing replacing him with his very own top paid kind of stands out\nOn the other hand I Want to give you a perspective on this\nBecause I'm not a legal expert enough certainly never served in office like this\nBut Jeff Sessions has deeply disappointed almost every conservative I Know that I've had the opportunity to talk to in fact every time we take the show on the road Washington DC a wind up talking to members of Congress and their staff I ask them what the heck is up with Jeff Sessions\nHe comes into the job and everybody I think almost every conservative thought very well up Senator Sessions he seemed to have a steel backbone he seemed to have a real command of all the issues that he took on and it gets into this job and all of a sudden he disappears\nFrom everything that they can be made like real estate investing in this area is a great way to start making money

foundation professor at George Mason university's ... school of law\nAnd the author most recently of the Republican workers' party now the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed this ... welcome to the program thanks for the John Larson thank you for having me I'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people\nOf everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed this ... welcome to the program things all the time\nWith large thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of a president but frankly I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we need it\nAbsolutely right I mean way we're bound for stagnation remember when people talked about two percent growth in the new normal now we've got four percent yup they said it could never happen and we had a\nYeah I'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by you know really nice people but they just weren't up to the struggle of taking it on to them you\nKnow they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he we we are getting rid of him eventually I mean now at the end of the year\nUh but but this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nCat food they write you know and the thing about and I'm Glad you and that's all right and I couldn't agree more of a thing as the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I work on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president and vice president shouldn't we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all races creed and all that I mean but we're looking after the people\nWho have been left behind and I you know I'm I'm afraid that the kind of internationalist wing of the Republican Party all in favor of you know free trade agreements and and all of that they had lost touch with them and and then the end\nYou know we succeeded I'll tell you one thing about the book I debate left wing earth and and they say workers kind of we own that word and I say you know your ears to\nThere used to be a Democratic Party\nThat looked after ordinary people and that was not a vote party but you've given that up and you know what we ate their lunch\nIn fact doesn't seem and I I look I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man working woman I keep wondering the policies they adopt\nSeemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of folks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the ... sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well\nAnd and so there there it's the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nBy the way that's up from about fifty six thousand above five years back I mean we're we're doing pretty good I mean the wages are going up but you know the the thing about the the dams is they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with the concerns of of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans in a you know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nYou don't miss dramatically you just said something that made me think uh from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and sometimes we're used terminology ... that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms in one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that\nFrom my audience the way you see it\nThe various terms in one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that from my audience the way you see it\nWell it it's like to hear from the dams um you know you start by saying what's their race what their gender and so on and uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong race or the wrong ... that does to your your your there they're not terribly interested in you\nBut mostly you know it means that they're obsessed with you know trivial concerns like transgender bathrooms bicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job\nRight know without the oil worker was worried about about you know what regulations are doing to the economy\nSo you know they they've gotten invested in frivolous concerns\nOf the people who got you know who made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason University School the school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed\nI I think you've spoken to some of these really important because\nWhen you becoming a lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house payment this month the car payment or\nCan we really afford to take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class\nAnd so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to go then ... out in pretend that you care about that coal miner who's being booed Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job a friend who running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left this is where the the series justified as sad as where\nThere was this big old union battle back in the Nineteen thirties and you know Pete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I I thought this is great you know I Know which side the elite is on I saw the coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump so you know\nBut you know talking about the elite that look or you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway I'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to my class 'cause I got these relatives who are working on the assembly line in Detroit\nAnd I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently uh was telephone injustice what how does that figure into the whole equation\nThe oil and you know I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works in Russia is see for a judge reaches a verdict pill form of the you know the party Boston the communist days you'd say what should I Do right so the telephone you know using the telephone to determine what was going to be the result\nAnd I said you know in America we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law and Russia and we got too much but here we got we got to search going on for the great Trump ascendant and and you know mostly is is just kind of ordinary strollers like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of\nThe line for the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nIt wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he would\nYesterday I went out he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause\nI don't understand why he with his background didn't the just assume whatever I talk to the right to tell the Russian ambassador is going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI and say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have\nEvery ... from your conversation and they may be trying to move your into a into a process crime\n[noise] well you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement of the FBI ... most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly where we are in the country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate said Frank 'cause I've had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents cops sheriff's deputies\nYou hate to start acting like when the police show up for the FBI shows up you say I should treat them like a treat the G argue if I was a a an an occupant of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party and he hails from George Mason university professor it's good to have you on the program we'll look forward to return\nTo tell the president who should be there and you heard a lot of that language of the last week well he may be qualified but he's not the right man for the job\nWell the person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president\nSenate can say this president you've nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her but in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply affirmed that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way and I mentioned this\nLittle uh it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump sitting behind a resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk from him\nAnd Donald Trump listing for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes now I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy\nNow why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy all I'm find to be put on I'm OK with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit of ...\nI uh I have a conversation that they live welfare and the reason why a lot of people have okay say you know first of all let a lot of jobs so far the job and they say we're getting more money for more\nAnd then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute and AIDS and and I\nAnd the print just shot a\n... which is actually far harder now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problems we saw the super\nBowl ... while the ...\nSo uh I think it's the way\nScare and how ...\nIt gives you power in a way he's talking about the hat that does keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan and he's saying this how gives you power and why\nYou know my dad and my mom separated so I have a lot a male heir she came out at all of a marriage or are\nThey doing that though [laughter] you know everyone but a CAT scan may need to know the guy they can get to see my dad all the black guy\nSaw it was ... and they feel like Superbad we made\nHero now\nThat's kind of guy he was saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero\nYou feel like Superman who made\nThat they are\nNow that's Kanye West saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero\nI Know that a lot of the left to sit this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to he says you grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said to young women\nHave more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and none of that ... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say the programs that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them\nAnd you may or may for me like I said you know what\nAt that point I didn't believe that went out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was one I miss but I I dropped out one out because yeah he was sitting in the oval office Kanye West managed to drop a couple of swear words\nBut his message was all conservative and this is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who was both black\nAmerican and successful it's sitting there in front of the president of the United states saying I admire what you've done I support what you've done I'm wearing this had it turns into Superman and what in the world is wrong with that but have you with me at eight\nSix six four three nine five to seven seven and

sure Johnny ... bud guys welcome\nBack to the Lars Larson Joe it's a pleasure to be with you on what I like to call conspiracy theory Thursday glad to get your\nCalls to eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com and I always promised to tell you if I have a dog in the fight so I have a dog in this fight because\nI occasionally by things on Amazon and I find that kind of convenient but his Amazon getting so big that it could literally threaten our economy when\nMichael ... joins me now sealed the cyber education foundation and founder of the justice society he's also the author of the devil inside the beltway which we've talked about before Michael welcome back to the program\nI Do I get it back with you sir\nI'm doing very well so I like Amazon I Do business with them but I still do business with bricks and mortar stores a lot of other companies why do we now see Amazon is something so big it literally threatens our economy\nBecause it'll baby tigers are cute and when they get around that kill ya okay [laughter] I don't know for ... and ... and conspiracy theory Thursday step either I rarely buy and and so I you know look\nIsn't it interesting how he started calling at Amazon from the beginning it he pulls you and he does what we call loss leaders okay so we get so much money he loses money to undercut everybody else gains market control then you know\nPull in close enough to slap in the face and now he owns the Washington Post so he can control the message you can trust me there ... it\nAnd that's not all bad I mean obviously they have done positive destruction they have challenging but this market dominance in this monopolistic behavior and and how brutal they are\nA too small business it is it's tough it's you know uh so it's it comes to an anti\nThey are a too small business it is it's tough it's you know uh\nSo it's it comes to an anti trust level I mean by a large I Love the efficiency that he's built in and I I have time also and I liked the challenges to you know ... ... businesses all businesses off the monopoly that'd be great\nOh yeah well actually I wouldn't because you know Michael I've told I told my audience mild metaphor is not as good as your baby tiger metaphor but I've told them you know if you said what I like to be the only talk show host in America no because having competition sharpens my game and I'm afraid I'd get lazy if I was the only game in town\nRight and and your your exactly right so\nWhy is the founding fathers decentralized power is unified towers bad with human beings that just governments so we have Amazon who now has\nThese ... these machines that listen to us they can understand what's going on at as data that is now wants to be the only clout for services provider for the military for a decade\nAnd the amount of a market steak corner and\nThat that they connect between those markets is terrifying when it's in the military and personal information and and and you know\nThe newspaper in the media it's you know it it's not about them it's turning into a true anti trust to play and that's where it's going to go\nWhat has the FCC had the securities and Exchange Commission had anything to say about this because they certainly regularly my industry heavily they tell radio companies you can only own so many radio stations and every mark and we're not going to allow you to become dominant or is it do not big enough yet to to trigger that\nI ... well of course you know when all anyone cares about the media today as Russia Russia Russia and they can't leave out from President this the price we pay because you know\n... ... ... listen these big tech companies you know how fast these guys got huge it's like that movie alien where it's almost a cute in the beginning and then I'm like ten minutes in the movie is\nEight feet tall so you know and you're like wait a minute why happen air or kind of caught off guard but the companies also learn from Microsoft and the government jumped on micro\nMicrosoft so that they were in Seattle is having a nice life and here in Europe and the U.S now everyone learns that and all you know Amazon ... lobbing and they've got these beautiful\nBeautiful offices in DC and so it is so this Google and so does Facebook and they're all breaking bread and getting a number but I I mean they're not down there protecting their turf and their shareholders so\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation we have our problems in our addictions with our Facebook and our Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it is and this is the other worry I have Michael ... that even if we say well they're too big I got to respond to this one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... no longer and they're about to go out of business would seemed\nBut back when ... first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the market boys and said you don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store\nYou can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darned amazing to say\nUh you know I could see me I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so spheres was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is that on steroids but we were\nYou know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure\nSo is yours was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is that on steroids but we were\nYou know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're going to wipe out the local general store will they didn't you know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm a guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that\nAs we're in a world marketplace now if we say Amazon we've got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big wheeled China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't get big but China can have a you know uh you know can have companies that are that big are we going to see the day where we've knock down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to publishing that government part I I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because\nYou know apple apple Amazon and the the lights and the constitution of belief and the human rights things that they just look the other way when they do businesses ... Tories\nAre leading me to believe that if we put our foot down and not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away and that while they want to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so\nUm it it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer up because they have done a lot of really good innovation and that's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find the other direction\nWhich I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas\nUh then we've got a problem at but you know these people have had so much money they do more profit margin is more than the economy's most country yup\nSo which is very careful about this and they're interacting with our regulatory cars that regulatory and the ... in the country is it's pretty lousy\nUh we all all care votes enforcement United States not education and that these regulations his lawyers with a you know law suits and they're they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough holding them accountable that's why I think the anti trust ways the only place to go and I'm Wondering what the the judicial system or not that will handle it off\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in and big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which\nSo far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance an overreach into cyber security medicine in small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nIt off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state so maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why um it is just qualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something\nI don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did and there are certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses or contemporaneous statements to back it up\nA book but in theory what the accusation was something that it's\nJust qualifying for drunk

watched her and while she sure looks credible to me\nUm but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years and what do you do when no one backed it up at me and what about that front door she she got a front door because two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those in germs are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental

it will make having all look like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent using prosecutors ... during the more local cases are afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the meat to crowd of you're attacking women know you're attacking a liar\nYou're attacking a dreamer so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone and say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and try to falsely accused somebody you too will face consequences\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sent have sent innocent men to prison um while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often going to be a federal cases local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking you serious way\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a ... one where I drew equally hard how do we get that dynamic to shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the world and go after a fall took user\nYes and as you indicate it's other men this idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward\nNo actually we do want to discourage that we don't want people's lives being real and um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape\nUm there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks that have a\nUm really bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in highschool served five years in prison\nUm got out and his accuser called and I apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on tape\nHe got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings so it's gotten a zero press that's this guy Brian Banks I tweeted a review of the movie on yesterday\nI'm but I'm dying to see it I've just I've just read the review and think of it this guy's life was completely ruined I mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done

Cory Booker saying get in their face Maxine Waters and get crowds around people\nSomething's gonna happen and we already had scali sketch shot we've already seen crowds override Ted Cruz chairs and there's an other cabinet members but this is not what we want for our country and I think Americans are looking at essence saying it's not\nDemocrats not just regular average people this is the leaders of their party advocating for that and I think Hillary Clinton what she said it's so remarkable it's a seismic shift in our democracy for her to say\nWe will not be civil\nUnless we're power what a threatening thing to say it is not that long unless wind power\nRun it you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal the four year old and the surreal Iowa who's decided usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the captain crunch goes into the grocery basket and and it's the behavior you\nKind of expect from some kids who are poorly raised is not the kind of behavior you expect from top members of the Democratic party saying we're going to continue to be ... in civil I'm not sure which one is probably an civil or until you give us power back and we're going to scream and yell and and probably\nHurt some people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we did it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry out a real active of violence\nThat they're going to catch the blame on this\nI think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out ... and I mean with the Democrats for not for a long time but this is a new low for their party\nAnd the way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out and do the anger division I mean with the Democrats have run out division for a long time\nBut this is a new low for their party and it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that\nAre frightening with these beliefs we've seen our senator having have security details this is not something we want long term for our country and the Democrats have to be called out and I'm saying is that you're one of the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrats basis I don't like it they'll interrupt\nTheir family dinners or crate mopped around them what you should do is go go\nGo get involved make a difference volunteer stand up for the people you know but we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our country and Democrat leaders need to be called out and I hope\nThat the voters are looking at this because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by them living in these terms the only way we bring back stability to Washington is if we reject\nThe playbook that they've been riding on his temper tantrum that they've got drunk for two years now\nRock can I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I put a bug in Europe and I I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you let's put it that way\nBut I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do the thing they should do which is go to democratic leaders leaders and say will you condemn these calls for violence now\nI compared the other night I was in Seattle for a a form of your panel with a bunch of other tacos from one of my ... and somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have\nNice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party believe the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way they do and that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't\nYou know I as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right\nBut because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters\nCan we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president is is you know understands that when you push the buttons of media\nIf we saw some Republican stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they're holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks asking for condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight\nAnd if if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that\nI think the media can only ... ignored so long\nAnd then they'll have to acknowledge well maybe we do need to go to Hillary Clinton and say you just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily that's sort of the you know the go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should all their feet to the fire\nI agree and and we just put together a video that was released today showing some of these mobs that have been created a along with the words of the Democrat leader as we are definitely trying to hold Democrats accountable and you're right immediate need to do it and we need to help\nPush the media to act in a way that they don't always do because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over us so\nWe are going to continue to set an example of civility we're going to continue to run out of the issues the results that have happened to this administration that has made life better for millions of Americans straight quite set up ... percent unemployment\nFor a million new jobs ... is that so many great things are happening across this country and we will contrast that with the resistance\nLike that ... is that so many great things are happening across this country and legal contrast that with the resistance and the vision and the district get ... as the Democrat Party and hopefully I Know that are set\nThe voters overeat jak this terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to\nWind because you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various venues and he was he in generating gigantic crowds\nAnd I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble and and when the president responded I think there were a couple of times when as a candidate\nHe said throw that guy out or ... you know things like that and they were at the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence\nBig you know they will do that as you say if it's a Republican who does that are conservative who says something if I took to the air and said let's go out in the streets and burns and things like antifa does which I Would never do\nA you know that that that would be condemned quickly so if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own\nI think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it\nWhy aren't you asking the other side ask the folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown and the state where I broadcast ask her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low let's kick up will you condemn that and if you want why not I think it might be effective wrong\nWalking around through the ... procedure rooms they had criminal ... who came at night Dr ... nights\nAt to this place and would be eating breakfast cereal in the room with the people were doing these procedures I mean this was an extraordinary thing the bodies were piled up by the way in the basement you know and the body for piled up in the refrigerator same place where people have to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and that wasn't newsworthy that wasn't newsworthy in America you know you know ... ... talk ...\nWho's written a book about guns now to choose specific things and I think to conservatives these issues are familiar\nThat kept the media way one it involved abortion although not abortion the way it is done legally in Nebraska but done Mars or a slaughterhouse and I don't think I'm over reaching out to ... now is black\nYeah it's funny actually it's funny somebody just real to me and said are you worried about being called racist\nI was working on this story from nearly two years before I realized she was black you're just knew the name I just you know I met him I mean I met him I Know I never noticed he was black and I ... that might sound weird to people but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby's life and then cut the next with scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yeah he is actually but I ... we had never thought of I mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of\nNoticed that he was black now tell me about this\nThe most interesting thing I think about your ... shoes you got a chance to sit for three hours and talk to this man in person yes for you in the same room where you through glass\nI was in the same room and I'm like yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought we were going to have the ... the protection of the Plexiglas and in fact actually we're in this kind of coffee lounge\nWhere he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door about against ah against the wall and he pushed his share opened his legs and kind of trapped me between his legs if you know what I mean I my legs cross\nAnd then it continuously touched my my my knee as he would make points and it's on sorry once I'm terribly sorry\nAnd he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has this man less Lewis voice the soft voice he smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is serving three life sentences and talks about you know it was an awful shame you didn't get into the poetry class\nAnd and that he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations because he's just ... like this\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to music and you know he really liked reading and hasn't been able to read because he's been so busy all these years but it gave them to read true crime which he really enjoys I mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah because he was talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I\nStarted listening to ... you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brand free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name\nAnd I love ... by the way the Belgian crude or who died you I bet a lot of your listeners would know having a big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself to death but I had this incredible voice and goggles looking at me saying what's the name what's the what's the name of that song on the famous one and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at the ...\nCredible voice and goggles looking at me saying what's the name what's the what's the name of that song on the famous ... and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at the ... and then of course I say you know kind of ... and then he leans right in Maine goes\nMimic he did and start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like\nAre you serious is this what's happening right now yeah so that was a guy has\nNo sense not what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have if you just generically told the story I mean left out the door but just said he murdered a couple of ... ... does anyone know for certain how many babies were put to death by by having their spines approve of pursue according to the\nGrand jury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stopped with this hurt evidence they said it was in ... there was that and that is why exactly as you said in your introduction it is very safe to say he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne Casey Ted Bundy the Soviet kill all of them combined come nowhere near that\nSo this guy and you know the only reason he's not on the list of the most prolific serial killers in America is the only reason is because you'd have to acknowledge the humanity of those children\nAnd that is something that we want to do we want to make sure he gets the title because these were human beings I've seen the photographs of them I can tell you these are these are children who made the world will never now no and we need to acknowledge them and be a you know be a witness to the fact that they lived and and\nIt's not an overreach to call his clinic an appetite for ... that it was a slaughterhouse and that it had all the aspects of the slaughterhouse yes would you mind describing you know it's interesting I think what we're going to do this in the movie on a\nWhile and we don't do that from the movie but we do do it in the book and I would warn you that Steve myself if one is ... and we don't feature and see myself in the in the movie at all but see myself with one of the people who helped ... and he was one of the people who get was a witness and described conditions in the clinic\nAnd he said that the the blood ran down the walls he said there were just so many of them I ran with scissors I was a fireman in hell this is a guy under oath this is what he said under oath he's serving Fifteen Years himself because\nHe also killed ...

background from where did your level of animals in your research comes from\nI grew up with dogs and everything as a kid we had to always seem to have one so I've had a love of animals my whole life and horses are really also love never owned a horse but horses always carried a special place in my heart\nAnd to find these wonderful animals it has just been a fabulous fabulous journey my first book was on Sargent reckless\nThe great Korean War horse that served with the marine corps in Korea when I discovered her story and did her book I was actually able to get a medal for\nReckless call but Dick and metal turns out that's the Victoria across for animals it's the greatest metal an animal can receive for a gallon trained bravery and so when I was discovering and doing the history and

senator and I sort of had an at large entry into the or the military academy but you know was able to uh fend for myself pretty well they're held my classmates and I was able to get an armored slot was what I wanted so I ended up going to Germany for my first assignment\nTo the ah three twelve ... which was uh divisional cavalry squad and the third Armored Division and really enjoyed my time there be a lot of good friends\nCame back to the advanced course Fort Knox and then went straight down to Fort Stewart\nWith a unit and eating their ... and was deployed for the Gulf War in early summer of Ninety Ninety spent the next ten months in the tropical paradise of ah the middle east so and after that I came back I got out and went into explored the are\nThe jobs scenario out outside the I'm going to hang out with those civilian people there was a number of reasons for that but we'll get into that later but the I think it was it was a good step for\nGod to Muslim civilians you made so many of them it's like okay we're talking about warriors as we discussed last week with autumn there's lawyers at every level of society and and as you pointed out a couple of times you out to be committed\nYou ought to be committed and focused as if you're gonna be a warrior we'll talk mostly military and again don't want to put down the other wars certainly as I've said a hundred times on the show people in law enforcement or not our brothers in arms but there certainly are first cousins and valor they put their lives on the line every day for people that don't even know\nMany of them don't even like him so please don't take that as an exclusive but we're talking about people in uniform right\nEverybody puts on the uniform better be prepared to become a warrior is that a fair statement\nYou know any of that is exactly what I was thinking as funny you should say that because to be a warrior you need to train to be a warrior I think inside a lot of us think of ourselves as warriors\nBut the men and women that are going into battle they need to train every single day as closely as they can to replicate combat conditions because you never really know how you're going to react so\nThe closer you can get to replicate those conditions and training day in and day out to be a warrior ants you know your enemy no the order of battle the more that you know the more you trust the people around you the better you're going to fight\nAnd I think that is true\nIn any scenario in life whether you're in business or whether you were in sports but especially when you're a warrior you have to train and you've got to know your equipment you got to know your friends and you got to know the enemy preparation is what you said and that is one of the keys to being a warrior I think\nWell and in business you are not going to be competing for a contract and you were in it and I don't\nThat's competition but it's not like a shot right nonetheless it's no less the same thing and the people who joined the military may be they never deployed maybe there in the guard reserves are never activated but they still\nHave decided for whatever reason usually a multitude of reasons to put their lives available to send the combat you might be a medic or you might be a mechanic or you might be a\nFinance clerk or you might be an instrument or you might be anywhere\nBut in the military you ask what you want to take what you get and my dad's best friend who served in World War two as a replacement guy in Europe said you come in and you're a\nMechanic and suddenly we need fifty to tank drivers you're now a tank driver [laughter] ah that might be how you were trained but here's what we need you the ... for that the officer\nAnd so therefore if you put the uniform on you better be ready to be a warrior regardless of what you're currently assigned as and that's I think a key issue this is going to end the Gilman front lines of freedom and we're discussing the nature of warriors with math have\nThen there are those who suddenly find themselves in a combat zone whether it's in a combat role or not I suspect that would appear motivation\nI Would hope so yeah I mean in in that and that's a that's a bad place to be the it's a bad place to be in a combat zone but a non combat essentially non combat personnel and find yourself in a convoy that gets attack I think unfortunately\nMany people don't feel they're ever going to be in close combat situation but if you are deployed to a combat theater of operations you need to sort of get your mind wrapped around that warrior spirit and say we can be attacked at any time\nPerhaps even by civilians for whatever reason so you always have to be on top of your game and that again preparation and I think the mindset of being a combat or your that's the biggest thing to be prepared for anything\nYeah I think the Marines have a\nSort of a model or something that says everybody's whenever I don't care what you are your primary thing is you're also an advertisement that attitude would carry then there are those who conduct combat artillery fighter pilots those kind of people who attacked the enemy but don't do it personally mhm\nMhm and then there are the people the close combat people the infantry armor special ops type people who potentially go face to face with the enemy those are sort of different levels but all of them need that warrior mindset and all of them sort of need to be prepared to be anywhere in that spectrum\nRight yeah I Love the or the marine mindset is that they train everybody to be a fighter and then after that okay you can go and be an electrician or a cooker because they need everything but all those and all that says they all know how to fight very similar to the Israelis\nEverybody has to be good script into the army men and women so they teach everybody how to be in uniform how to be a soldier and how to fight and protect the country and then you can go back to civilian life and be an accountant or a salesperson or an inventor or whatever but everybody has a taste of what it's like to surf and to be in the military and to protect the country important\nYeah it's really important person is more likely to motivate you to do that if you have seen your school get attacked by a rocket or something like that than here in the United states given that the warriors spirits a warrior attitude is something that everybody in our military needs it's something that needs to be appreciated understood\nAnd even replicated by we citizens because none of us particularly want to be victims either\nSo that's something that is transferable to the civilian world\nThough not only aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level and the intensity and sometimes violence that the military has\nBut they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life of protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically but also to be prepared\nTo be very violent and that takes a toll on people you see all the pie TST coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and I think there are people in our society they think that we love the violence and we're out there just to kill people and stuff that's the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do\nAnd I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes a toll on everyone that's involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we were able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your body gets shot you do not have time to grieve not even a second you know the guy that picked him off got his crosshairs right on you so what are you going to do to get out of this position and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later for that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself breathing so there's there's an intense emotional toll that it takes on a person to be in combat but that's always got to be later it can't be in a moment\nAnd that's all part of the nature of the warrior right there is a lot more to discuss about this and folks on because they haven't met back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a warrior Matt thank you for taking time to join us today thank you for your service to our country thanks for being part of the financial freedom to\nDanny as always my

Tsering adjust the Tarheels one is brave from Pete in stadium\nClear skies temperatures about in the fifties\nHere tonight a big game for Virginia jak in its place in the ACC coastal deficient\nTime for back to school to three question quiz for Mike about Virginia jak in North Carolina the first question for you Mike as we go back to school at the short answer a question for you and your check is eight one after a loss under coach went to of course losing to\nNotre Dame a week ago how come why and has he and his staff been able to be so successful coming off of losses what do you think\nAre the coach who has a way with words and you and sugar coat things Andrea many brutally honest and blunt about how things are I mean what just happened\nThe mistakes that were made and what has to occur to get back on track and you think about him and his staff I mean they're really good at turning the page moving forward he talks about you can't change what's already happened and\nBy the way when you think about that one lost that one the one the one part that was last year hokey or Seventy one member they went to Miami lost that game and then had to go to George tech what was that like a new game you drove in my dad got rich got there really late I got about what twenty eight twenty two yeah something like that that's the one\nDay on that they couldn't pull off but they've been really good that's worth that whole\nThat whole macho want to know go on and I want to know that is what the whole thing is all about\nAnd already this year we've seen Virginia Tech handle it really well that tough laws Virginia Tech had against Old Dominion and bounce back really well the next week against Duke so Virginia Tech is handled it\nSo far in this season pretty well another opportunity here tonight against North Carolina after falling to Notre Dame of good order team\nBy the way Notre Dame team that just barely got past Pittsburgh will have more scores coming up drop the course of our broadcast but Notre Dame ranks fifth of the country just got passed Pittsburgh today at home [noise] Nineteen to foresee alright question number two for you might still end up like North Carolina [laughter]\nI'd like to sweat North Carolina extended Larry foot doors contract prior to the two thousand Seventeen sees it at the time for door was forty and twenty five ...\nSince then the Tarheels have gone for and twelve athletic director above accounting him feels black about that extension about semi sick [laughter]\nMean think about twenty Fifteen I mean that was a great year under coach but or they were ...\nYou're under coach but are they were Lebanon three right say\nThey've lost their opener to South Carolina and one eleven games in a row including that overtime game in Blacksburg and coach boomers last home game that's where they won the coastal they lost the clubs and I guess from the championship game then they lost her bowl game to Baylor then you go to twenty sixteen they're eight and five still okay\nThen last year three and nine and now they're sitting there one in three their ... and in the wrong direction Andrew don't have the players that used to have\nObviously of course are having to suspend those guys who's Thirteen guys who got suspended for various and sundry games that hadn't helped matters at all but they're definitely turning in the wrong direction\nI felt this maybe the whole story line of the day for North Carolina you know who's making an unofficial visit today yeah how about that game as Kelly Bryant the former starting quarterback\nFor Clemson on the sideline or thereabouts for North Carolina here tonight taking an unofficial visit that is called desperation mode for Larry foot or I can understand why why it might be attracted to the plank time opportunity and you can certainly understand why Larry foot door and this staff are trying to grab some players\nTo help him keep his job moving forward question number three for your Mike it's an essay question breakout depends on the two games right well this has been\nThe ACC quarterback of the week versus do get a bit of the roller coaster against Notre Dame great place but then again tries to be Superman and tries to do too much so what do you want to see from the overland Park Kansas state of tonight seems\nStick with the game plan Andrew not try to do too much you know coach went they talked about that and he talked about last week they old Kenny Rogers song you know no one to hold them knowing when to fold them yeah I mean that's certainly applies to Iran I mean he's got a big are uh you can't be afraid to throw it away if if the windows are just too tight or don't be afraid to get down or throw it out of\nBounds before taking the big hit or you think about it the\nLast thing that just the nice to have happen Andrews is to get him hurt right you're already down Josh hooker and played a lick\nNope and if I Will switch to get hurt his team could be in big trouble not the end of her could he just doesn't have the experience\nAnd went ahead and hook her place he's running the football and yeah that really throw the football as well bonus question for you by good bonus question short hair on their those\nExtra points for you get your Bryan Johnson was busy against Notre Dame the sophomore from DC went three for five both Mrs from forty five plus what we learned about the huskies kicking situation against the Irish\nWhile you know the ones he miss was what forty seven fifty two yards I mean he was seven for seven going into that one\nHe had long a forty five I think versus William and Mary so he's got plenty of leg and a lot of it and he had plenty on the to Mrs but the big stage brings even bigger pressure\nWhen you need and points to keep it really really close I think he probably learned a valuable lesson man you got to take a deep breath and just do your job don't try to over ... learn from what happened\nLast week because he certainly got the leg and it proved it until those two big measure when the pressure on the big stage maybe got to him a little bit no doubt about\nIt a good question Michael ... in a
