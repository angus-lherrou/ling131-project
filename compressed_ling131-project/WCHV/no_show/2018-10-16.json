McNally the executive director of free our Internet ... good to have you back on the program\nWell thank you for having me so what does Google think about the possibility of legislation being written that might affect the way they operate oh\nI I I don't ... they um\nI think there it it\nKind of a cue faith thing with them um I think they say one thing when they are up at uh the hell and they kind of a fight to a legislation and then we have this new leaked document called that the good censor\nUm and it talks about how they want to basically ... the Internet and American to a European a utopia so [laughter] um\nI I think they're talking out of both as their mouth and I think people like you and I and that other\nPeople who are what they call that keep their feet to the fire\nYou know it's interesting that a as a search engine uh I I Wonder\nThey are if people understand the thing you're groups have been trying to bring to people's attention and that is that by slightly changing the search results you can create an entirely different reaction by people to all kinds of things news developments and that sort of thing\nUm there was an example of it over this past weekend I was looking for some stories that I knew existed from a short while ago a couple of years ago where a man had been confronted by a group of antifa need pulled a gun to protect himself and then he was prosecuted for doing that\nAnd I know the guy's name uh I Know from covering the story and I know how to spell than I I put it in and nothing popped up about those stories and I thought I Know there there\nSo I put the name unquote marks and again it didn't pop up\nBecause it was an example where a man it actually been prosecuted for engaging in self defense and I thought I'm Wondering if this is part of their new algorithm where\nI put in you know Mike Strickland which is the guy's name and then I put in gun and then I put in charge or convicted I Know he was convicted and he was sentenced to some time in jail\nAnd the stories weren't popping up at all and I thought I wondered how I mean I was using Google is a search engine\nBut if you if you change things just to ... you can make it appear to somebody that certain stories just don't even exist even though these are in mainstream big newspapers and it was covered pretty extensively at the time do you think I'm running into some of Google's new censorship where they're trying to to make\nYou know make this European uh paradise you talked about\nWell and and that's not actually if blood and new thing that they're doing I'm back right after the Parkland incident uh for at least twenty four hours if you\nPut in a word that had to sequence G. U. N. so like right near where I live there's got to stop you know New Hampshire and a gun and roses\nOr a dozen roses and didn't exist\nFor them and to allow\nSay they like when that sequence gee you and if the word had that the Clinton it\nIt could not be found so and it's not something that is you know I think they are as yet people like you and I have been talking about it for such a long time now people are starting to notice it and with this document you know that was a lease last week\nPeople are starting to become aware I'm you know leaving and\nBeing told that has two years it's a conspiracy theory there's nothing to this the algorithm is a computer you know we're not doing this on purpose well clearly\nThis document shows that they\nWant to be a quote unquote the good sense there for you know we're going to ban them free speech for safety and civility\nWell and and how do you increase civility if in the immediate aftermath of something terrible happening\nYou know a plane crashes and so you say I Wonder what the history of plane crashes is associated with that airline you might go in and put in\nYou know plane crash and and the name of an airline if they say well we don't want to bother people you know so we're going we're just going to censor those results you don't really need to know about plane crashes or somebody has poisoned with\nYou know strict nine or poison with arsenic and so you put in arsenic poisonings and nothing pops up how does that make them more civil what does even their argument for how that makes them more civil society when you say whatever it is people are asking about right now\nDon't tell them they can ask about it in a week\nMy the bigger question is who are they to decide to sell for point and\nAnd I guess they're straight ahead answer which is a tough one for me to answer is there a private company\n... they're not a government so they can engage in any censorship they want to technically legally just like I couldn't decide to take a phone call from a listener or I can decide I don't want to take the phone call from a listener\nNobody can force me to do that or forced me to talk about something or not talked about something they can say we're no different than you are lawyers and so it's a tough one for me to beat\nExcept by maybe shaming them by saying why are you denying people access the information if you want to be the index to the Internet of all things\nWell I think I think here's where where we might have them because in this document that they actually talk about being a publisher\nUm and um how they get you know right now they they get around you know the whole censorship thing because of um you know some certain legislation that you know they allows them to um ... if they can act without a you know they they\nThey don't go why building right you know\nYou know the the ... communications\nDecency act um but if they want to start considering themselves that publisher\nUm and they can start doing that kind of thing um then we can definitely\nUm start kind of more than put putting their feet to fire the other argument that I have an even I have gone over this a couple of times um where they control Ninety six percent of you know the search engine\nUm Kmart or do you know\nI I I mean I I Love you ours and I know a lot of people listen to you you don't have Ninety six percent market share with you know don't control\nI mean they're literally controlling what people see and I mean and if I mean let's let's talk about China I mean they are willing to completely put an alternate Internet in China that government can dwell\nGovernment government controlled in quotes but they're willing to sell their souls for the almighty dollar\nTo get into China and China as a as a as a rich and ...\nThey're going to go in there they're going to put on the Internet and they're going to let the government tell them what those people can see and what they can spend\nIf they're willing to do it in that context why wouldn't they do it with us and they're and\nThey're willing to do it with us because they they have a view of how it should be anyway you know and and and the crux of my argument is they talk about how bad the United states you know they get up there on their little ... boxes and they say you know the United states is you know massage and stick and were horrible to minorities and all of this stuff\nAnd the reason why we have to you know do this is because people are being ... fold and they're being bullied and and um you know America is just a assessed pool and I'm sitting here thinking okay but you're willing to work with the Chinese government\nWell and and the thing about that how does it even work is\nOr Christian leaving right now he's executive director for your Internet I think about this cruise to wait I look things up because I was taught by my dad always look things up\nImagine five six years from now I'm writing an essay about women who've told lies about alleged sexual misdeeds and I think what was the name of that Ford lady what was your full name wherever she a college professor because maybe I've blissfully forgotten about\nYou know about to crispy Boise a cushy Ford and and so I Want to go look her up but they've decided that well that will just be one of those examples used by ... to try to disparage the idea that that sometimes women\nThe person who actually write to the rule maybe six or eight levels below that person and when that person makes a changing the rules on\nI don't know how section eight housing is regulated you know in theory this the cabinet secretary above and the president above the cabinet secretary responsible for it but it was actually written by a civil service lifer who can't be fired am I wrong\nYeah now you are not long at all um the amazing fact is that in the last twenty five years in every year\nThe federal government's administrative agencies and regulatory agencies have put out three\nThousand rules while and that's over a hundred thousand rules over the last twenty five years now they haven't it hasn't been that that much legislation that would require all these rules so what we have is these agencies using legislation\nThat was made years ago\nTo write new rules now and the question is how would they really empowered by Congress many years ago to be writing the rules that they're writing today and that's one of the things that I think the the court system\nA court system the judiciary has to look into and stop\nWell let me let me try one example on you\nThere was a law or there was a an a a rule called title nine and as I remember the the essential purpose of it was we got all these schools public schools and colleges that have sports programs that are mostly aimed at benefiting young men uh football basketball baseball golf whatever\nAnd that you know young ladies were not getting the opportunity to write a rule and in general people sit down it's probably fair if you're going to have a football team you should probably have the equivalent so that a young ladies can get some opportunities as well not a bad thought but ... and not bad in practice until you find out a couple of decades later\nBy the way it's going to regulate which bathrooms are used by transgender individuals in communities and you don't have anything to say about it because Obama crafts a letter of guidance or his department of education does and all of a sudden you're you're ... your your daughter comes home and says hey\nThere was a boy who is using the lady the girls restroom now school well how'd that happen and it's something to do with title nine\nWhile I thought that was about sports no it's been used to rewrite the bathroom rules is that a good example where\nWhere they've taken a threat and misused it\nThat is an excellent example and it's something even more pervasive in the bathroom rule that is part of that and although you're entirely correct that what what Congress authorized was for any school that accept\nFederal money it has to make have a educational resources available\nWithout a correction or without any connection to sex that is women should have the same educational resources is Mitt yup what has happened to that now is that that legislation has been turned into a question of sexual harassment\nAt ... although it was ... it was directed at schools schools are the ones that were supposed to comply all of a sudden as a result of that language a education department has created a whole system for sexual harassment of student to student\nUm and so not only what sexual harassment is\nBut then what the punishment should be and how the person who is accused of sexual harassment should be tried none of that would ever have been considered by Congress back windows that statute was passed in Nineteen Seventy two well how about you know that's the kind of problem we're facing\n... okay we've got about a minute but Peter let me throw an idea that you\nSaw all these I don't expect that when they write the federal fish and wildlife law that says federal fish and wildlife has to write regulations you know pursuing to regulating\nYou know fish and game ha you know the federal level you hand out to the agency I don't want to I don't want them I don't want Congress writing and duck season starts on August fifteenth and ends on a holdout administrative detail does need to be dealt with somewhere but if you said\nAt some point within a year or two all those rules have to come back pass Congress\nAnd Congress has to say yeah that's right that's what we intended for you to do they can write the details but then Congress has to say yes\nAnd when we knew because we'd be alerted this is coming before the Congress those crazy rules that they wrote on section eight or ADA or or or or sex or title nine is coming back up for a vote and if they don't vote to approve of the rules simply goes away\nDo you think that kind of thing in ten seconds would actually make a train\n[noise] it would make a change but Congress is just too busy to deal with all these ...\nAll these rich memorized said three thousand regulations yeah and so for those to be which are all detail because as you point out he's a detail he's not the major subjects of the rules but just the details\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nThis flu season one long green sleeves I can make a world of difference so you can protect yourself and so you're close talking co workers fighting neighbors\nTwo month

Danielle\nIs in Fargo North Dakota Daniel welcome to the Ramsey show\nThanks for taking my call Cher what's up\nMy wife and I are relocating for a job or we currently live in Grand forks removing the Fargo\nAnd um when we sell our home will have roughly fifty thousand dollars inequity after ... a real turkeys and we're wondering what they would do would you put the fifty grand down on the new home or pay off something dumb that we did and that is the thirty one thousand dollar car loan and ... or so\nOr would show the car [laughter] sell the car okay [laughter] I thought that's what you might say well okay what's your hospital in\nA one hundred and bought a hundred and sixty five thousand\nRight so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation ... went there so clearly okay\nOkay let's say that we pay off the car with this money\nAnd then the losers twenty thousand dollar split down our house and if you saw the exact same house you were talking about buying earlier I'm a centrally you have financed your car on your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nAnd um that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse okay that's where that's how I got there so quickly because okay basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years\nWhich I'm not going to do whatever obviously what ... what are refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car not in a million years you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here\nAnd sometimes you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is done you know and so it's not\nIt's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this car over Fifteen Years\nYou know I don't want to do that so and it's a car I Can't afford on who can afford to pay for it um if you didn't pay for it when you can't afford it so yeah I'm Sorry dude I Know it's a sweet car and I'm a card guy like nice cars but I'm\nOr with us hey guys how are ya de welcome welcome where do you all live\nIn Indiana alright welcome to Nashville and all the way here to do a debt free screen\nOh yeah I Love it how much of you to pay it off so we paid off a hundred and forty two thousand five hundred dollars and twenty eight months\nGood for you and your range of income during that two and a half years\nWe started out about Ninety thousand and ended it about a hundred and forty five thousand wow great what he'll do for a living on a physical therapist and are on the engineering assistant at a local\nElectric utility company very cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of debt was the one hundred and forty thousand dollars\nWell I'll answer this question because all of it was mine yeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to good old Sallie Mae set wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what how many your story\nWell we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um well I was driving around in my work track\nAnd uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew um where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong or no\nAnd we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it a while which is like that yeah it was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have some leadership [laughter]\nShe used that word she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go to the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and then you can you take somebody does my back exactly\nYell at the the video guy you know very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the number because that kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the class coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt what's realistic\nWhen you first start Jim how did you do it this fast\nWe a lot of debt and twenty I ... it was a long yeah it was hard we started that fast the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it was hard\nI mean two years and four months running and yeah and that's what that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if yeah how old are you to um ... well we're both twenty and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter]\nVery good good for you guys thinking well time cool how does it feel\nNow that you've climbed the mountain\nIt's so great it's incredible\nI think it's one of the best feelings it's nice to know that we can move on to the baby steps now and we just want to live and give like no one else when they were excited for us to keep travelling through the baby steps\nYeah women you're making a hundred fifty thousand bucks a year and not even Thirty years older than me payments in the world in life is pretty good yeah that's awesome show or who are your\nBiggest cheerleaders I think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um and we kind of have some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction panels quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of debt people started to come around now when you look at somebody go body paid off for a hundred thousand dollars are going to shut them up you know absolutely yeah\nYeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it was good yeah\nThat's great very\nCool you guys very very well done what is the key to getting out of that\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all but also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked overtime but and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that and honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money that would be knocking out my lens ... no\n... no I gave you gave your boundaries on process you know what about you oh I'll take the the the\nIt was it was good I mean we we we work with a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt do you think it'll work extra hours or if the if you raise your income over fifty thousand dollar\nCourtney finished a residency program that was huge for her um she got a big raising them you know I Would I Would say call home and and be dispatch at the utility company and just the the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime home do it\nYou know it it really helps the snowball just\nPlow through and go to the finish line\nYou know there was something about that because you're getting traction if you were working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you you just be exhausted but it's weird how it's exhilarating because you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely it changes everything and now you can crank back down to a normal people hours now and not have to be so crazy but\nIf you want to go for something you know how to do it you'll dolled up you know and the both of

it comes out um all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those if you have investments simply\nInvested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own investments like a a mutual fund or a low turnover mutual fund\nYou'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if you've held

Studio hope you're well\nI Am doing very well today and excited about the fact that I Am back in the studio been a while and I couldn't come\nAt it a better time because we like you've already pointed out unbelievable when ... now everybody at Stewart horse racing his all going to victory later this year so a big accomplishment for a four team operation and more importantly\nThere are some people that we never would have perceived being in trouble with just one race because in Martin's will happen to be the the cut off that I think that are there right now and when you look at the overall playoff pitcher this coming Sunday ... ... ... is going to be a barn burner usually\nAlexis Erickson is with us that she's got a case of the I just bought a new house [laughter] need some fixer upper blues so she's got to play that out and brag yelling nice enough to drop in the sea very happy to\nBe here ah and you know so far the play offs of surprise me and a lot of ways obviously the rover we knew there was going to be some surprises but if you just think about this past weekend we went into Talladega super speedway with to Stuart horse racing cars minus ten on the outside looking in\nNow we leave Talladega super speedway one of those drivers is one of race and clip boy or the other driver\nHad a thirty one point swing he went from being minus ten now the plus Twenty one uh here in this cut off race for round number two so very impressive what they were able to do now a couple of team Pinsky guys on the outside looking in ... role against the wind\nJeff ... his second victory but in some ways his first these other was range short race where he was leading Daytona when it started but this one he out runs everybody runs in the front for all day long is he the biggest surprise left because now he's already punch to stick it in the final eight\nI might say yes but I'm definitely not going to say no but you have you\nBeen writing Eric Alva roller roller coaster all year long if I remember a lot of like what\nThe young man has done and I think he has finally been given the opportunity of consistency and he is showing give me a consistent race car and I will not embarrass you I mean that's just simply said I mean this guy has been very competitive\nHe's had opportunities he's let those slip through his fingers and not necessarily his fault but he has been leaving it out there I mean aggressively mean he had an opportunity to win a couple of races\nAnd you know bouncing off the wall of the crew messed up but the main thing is yesterday he he had to show some patients he did that\nThey showed how to be a good teammate he did that but more importantly when it came time to show their his bumper everybody else he did that also and he knew he was running on the news but yet he went up there and he he did what he had to do\nBusch helped him out a little bit of a truck [laughter] I wouldn't say Kurt Busch voluntarily held out just a little bit but I feel bad\nFor Kurt here's the interesting thing that dawned on me yesterday you know one of the great stories about this season and really more recently is we have seen drivers work their way up through talent\nRoss chest and got a phone call from chip and asked he said can you come run three races and what does he do he goes out there and leaves a bunch of laps in one he wins the next one and it was the runner up in the third one\nThen we see Ryan priest the guy who basically said look I got enough money to run a full season on sea level team or run two races on and they level team and he goes out there and shows what he can do now he's going fulltime cup racing next year with J. T. G. Doherty racing\nAnd I think maybe you look at Eric I'm roll a guy who has been in a you know mid to the back of the ... back of the pack car\nProbably for like the last five seasons are so now he gets in good equipment and is truly able to showcase his talent so one thing that I think we're really seeing this year\nTalent does pay off when you're able to showcase\nYeah but you you you know slow cars don't win right up the talent can only do so much but in this case uh Eric I'm roll it took a team that have been more about that tend team had done nothing right I mean and now\nThere and find a way mhm and so a lot of that I think Ninety percent of that ... state of what Eric I'm a role as been unable to turn that organization around I don't want to get your thoughts on what else we saw Taliban that wasn't the typical show\nOr frankly I was a little bit disappointed I think of Talladega I think a side by side maybe three wide seven rose date racing around we saw a lot of freight train led by the for cars Stewart horse racing who worked out beautiful plan\nTo pretty much shame everybody else jak famine your thoughts on that type of team racing we saw on display well let's remember they didn't start it\nYou go back in several years ago team Toyota showed that if you work together as a group you can rule the roost in super speedway race and I think that they're in the is in ... there was less than that was learned\nAnd they realize that you know guys if we set our cars up this way and we're willing to give up a little bit of this\nWeek in you know we can take advantage of the rest of the the field and they did and including teen Pinsky which was a forward so it was something that that was done in house or consciously by Stuart horse racing\nTip of the hat hat to a ... and everybody over there for\nShowing up with for race cars that that could be fast I mean that word you were looking for earlier if the if you got speed everybody else has to bow down to that I mean they really do I mean there are circumstances can can slow you down but speed is a really good ally now these guys unloaded fast and never look back\nYeah yeah and Jeffrey's right speeds a good ally they qualified one two three four they were able to make their pitch stall selections won three five and seven so that helped him out on the road but the other thing that impressed me more than anything is the way they\nPerfectly executed every one of those ... right down to the restart unless one sixty four after the debris caution I'm thinking to myself\nWell by now all bets have to be off and what do they do at the end of the race they all played like good teammates and they still continue to get in line just like they had and really when we were coming down to two labs to go\nThey weren't going to budge they were going to make someone else make a move like Brad 'cause Laskey was trying to do so to be able to have that restraint I Would think if you're not the lead guy of that group before but still be able to act as a team like they did that's pretty incredible the way they were able to execute and you\nKnow what the one thing I Want to point out we will never know exactly what the last lap would look like because I think it was an excellent job of getting that space if they needed to basically OK guys let's go for it was safe week who's got a better car here either\nBailey thanks a lot for seven for election Saturday we appreciate that ... yeah there's a lot of fun to have Jeff ham and here with us and\nThanks to all the radio stations you give us time to
