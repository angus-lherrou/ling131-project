[noise]\nAnd we'll start at ...\nFeet down your place their standards are not as we read the Bible together\n... chapter six and versus eight\nThe Bible says and Stephen and birthday and Steven\nFull faith and power\nStay in power did great wonders and miracles among the people\nThere there are certain of the synagogue which is called a synagogue or the libertarians answer Indians and Alexander ... and ... them of solicitor and an Asian disputing were Steven [noise]\nAnd they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which you speak and then they said born man which said we had heard him speak blasphemous words that gets Moses and Scott\nStirred up the people in The Elders and describes in came upon him in caught him and brought him to the council and set up a false witnesses which said this man ... not to speak blasphemous wars against this holy place and the law for\nWe have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shut destroy this place and she'll change the customs which Moses delivered us\nAnd all that sat on the council looking steadfastly on him\nSaw his face as it had been the face of an angel let's pray father thank you tonight for this passage of scripture and for others that will read it in a few minutes\nGod man you speak to each one of us tonight from your were made you help us to live every day or as it as if it's our last day on earth I asked us in Jesus' name amen you may be seen him\nThat was we continue our study tonight on the book of acts I Want to preach them on the subject [noise]\nLiving today like you might die tomorrow as X. six comes to a close\nSteven is living\nWe just read that he is having a hard time at this particular time and his life but he is living but just one chapter later we're told\nThat the same people who were falsely accused Steven inverse fifty a it said the stone him\nAnd the witnesses lay down their clothes at a young man's the whose name was saw and the stone Steven calling upon God and same Lord Jesus received my spirit and he nailed down and cried with a loud voice\nLord lay not this send to their ...\nAnd we need is a set of this he fell asleep\nIn the Bible says that Steven fell asleep it as not saying that he took a nap\nThe phrase fell asleep means that Steven had died he was stoned to death that day and he died there and he was alive one minute and yet was dead and the next\nTo the heart that means literally that they were song a songwriter you say what is it even me will ... is the idea is that they became exasperated\nIntentionally irritated by ... by one it was saying\nAnd not just a little irritation they were intensely irate with Stephen all because he preached a message that they did not like\nA mayor remind us again that when we preach or witness or share of the gospel when people don't want to hear\nIs really a because they just don't want to hear from our lord no they don't mind the baby Jesus but they don't want to hear from the Lord Jesus Christ at all but again and and by the way this not everybody but his son but again it's just as it was in Steven's day people like that are the ones who need Jesus the most\nBut as Steven preach the gospel\nAnd uh as the crowds didn't like it they were cut to the heart it's it and then in the Bible said\nThey Nashville on him with their teeth\nEvidently they were thirsty for his blood\nThey wanted to kill Stephen and the proven that even in our day the message of the gospel is not always a popular one\nIt just isn't and in fact in this day in time if you decided to do with his right like Steven was trying to do that you are sometimes labeled as an extremist have you noticed that or or as a fringe\nCoup maybe or as somebody out of the mainstream but ah but yeah Stephen ah when he\nPreached a gospel fly sometimes he was ridiculed of course he was far worse for him he was bent on with the tea and eventually they stoned him to death was hey for the ad for Stephen\nBut I like what the Bible says about Steven as all of us is taking place\nAs you're biding on him and they are about to stone him the Bible says but he and ... being full of the holy ghost ... Doug steadfastly in heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus stand on the right hand of God now you think about that\nAn end this tax several times were told that Steven was full of the holy ghost\nWow I don't know if it's mentioned wants is important it was mentioned twice it is very important Stephen ... ...\nIn his life\nBeing a fall or being controlled by the spirit of God and and in fact when all this turmoil was taking place around him he simply\nKIPP is I was on the lord\nWhat a great lesson for us tonight and and by the way the Bible makes it clear that there was a vast difference between Steven and the crowd see while they're all angry and hateful and ... and just\nFighting you know steaming is just simply focused on the war what a great lesson for us and and in fact a verse fifty five at all attention to that effect but anyway ah I guess the question is uh you know show in Steven's life\nThat he was different from the world there's a show in our lifetime\nCan people see a difference in us the way we live our lives as a show\nI Hope it does but but see stealing live today as though he might die tomorrow he lived a life\nThat was was filled with the spirit\nAnd focus on the savior\nI say Steven was Bertie when new\nReady in case this last should be over and can I say to us today every single\nPerson who's a born again shouting God every member of the body of Christ members and friends of our church we had a live today lives that are filled with the\nSpirit and focused on the savior that's the way we should live\nA ... and you know ... and if you study your Bible or there's a lot of very important people who the Bible says were filled\nI think of Jesus Christ\nIn ... jet her for the first one as he was about to be tempted to the ... the Bible says that he was full of the spear right and acts chapter eleven we'd read about Barnabas a and I think it's first twenty four of the Bible says that Barnabas was a good man and he\nWas filled with the spirit\nOf God and not only that but an ass chapter to an inverse for and describing the church\nIn Jerusalem says they were filled\nWith the holy ghost inhibitions chapter of for adverse chatter five rather averse number I think it's first number Eighteen Paul told the truth geneticist beef with the spirit\nSo listen when we think about this a matter of being controlled by God spared some really important to people who are\nIn God wants us to live our life as being filled with the spirit and being\nFocused on the savior now now listen if you knew that you were gonna die tomorrow [noise]\nDo you think it would change how you live\nFor some not a whole lot brothers may be a whole lot\nBut for all of us\nThink it may make us to start doing all we can to be completely controlled by and every decision in reaction to be controlled by God\nNot because you know when when that person is on their deathbed\nSometimes that altogether didn't we're looking at things\nAnd and sometimes they become you know a little more on ... on many times they become much more kind but I Want to be ... temporal by God\nI Want that in my life that's important I guess I knew for sure that in the next twenty four hours I Would die I Would want to go out of his life and I mean being filled by controlled by God's spear and focus solely on Jesus Christ\nOh we on Jesus Christ that is so very important\nSo lessons for all of a sudden I knowing that we could die tomorrow we ought to live lives better\nFor the spirit\nAnd focused on the savior second they did I\nNot only must we'd be aware of how we're living\nBut this is important\nWe need to be careful about who is leading\nUs in our life\nThat is important in fact a a ... if we were to die tomorrow\nI think and if we knew that\nEvery one of us will lead Jesus Christ lead in every decision we make\nI don't know to be true if I knew that I'm going to die tomorrow I'll do it would do matter\nVacillating Jesus make every decision that I make and that twenty four hour period notice ... again\nThe Bible says that Steven was\nFull of dust spread that means he was controlled\nBy Gus peers and when you're a full disappear\nOr you know ... again you're in good company [noise] I I I think I think it would mean like Barnabas\nHere Varmus in in a few studies life he was so full of beer that when there\nWas a tremendously greater burden of a neat in\nJerusalem among some of the members he took some of his own property\nAnd gave it to the church\nNow ... it could have been a very valuable possession I don't know but I didn't know this many people at our time\nWhen it comes to their money ride to hang on to it but not harness he\nWas so controlled by God spared that when God said sell your property\nAnd give it to the church that is what he did\nAnd you know that's so important but\nI I think of us you know the the church in Jerusalem [noise]\nThese people who are so\nFull of this sphere then one God says go out there into the city square in Jerusalem and it's only\nBeen a few weeks since Jesus had died and was crucified and rose again it's only been a few weeks and Jesus was not ... you know but a church I Want you to go out there into the streets and start preaching that Jesus is alive\nAnd you know they did they say\nThey went out there and ash after two they preach the gospel people got saved by the scores but see the point is they were making sure that Jesus Christ was leading them and that's important and can I say it is\nHere to scare the energy is this is leading you can't go wrong but here's a question\nWhich spirit is leaning you\nBecause some spirit is leaving your meat\nIs it our spirits and we got a ... by the way\nYou know we we have our own mind a and a ... minute remind us that the Bible says there was a way which same was right on to\nA man but at the end there are other ways of death\nAnd to be honest nobody here no matter\nHow long have you been saved no matter how intelligent you are no matter how insightful you may be how how and worldly wise you may be nobody here is qualified to lead your own life\nThat is true\n... and here's why\nYou had no idea what's up I had no idea you know if you try to navigate your own life\nOwn decisions all by yourself you made along fine for a while but I Want you to understand is at some point\nMedicare for all is actually much more is actually much cheaper than the current system that we pay right now\nThey're saying please don't say impeachment anymore what they say that I say impeachment beach\nIf it turns out that he does become justice Kevin are and your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee would you investigated for possible impeachment is to use on the Supreme Court and the Senate has investigated than anything else will have to\nDo investigate we would have to investigate\nAll right joining us now is the man himself he's got his brand new book out something I Love the title and like the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies doctors Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my bring this book is a must read for everybody and how are you good to see a\nVery social and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be appropriate as it is well below Seventy two hours book my we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well lose that your patriot and you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep 'em\nAmerica strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and when you gotta have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarized patient\nAt the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat evil exist read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing so\nThat what he said at the un is absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nEven exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to that godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this I\nDon't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House usually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times\nOnly probably picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one an attack die on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here and that is what literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat Americans enemies\nAnd we better do without apologies the tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWhere we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security\nHe wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the capacity of Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who used that philosophy in the past that philosophy drives to the labor camps to drive to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the\nPhilosophy and we've got to stop that Sean we have to stay true to the principles of the republic you\nTalk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can have anymore and you're talking about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others come back without their arms and legs in their in their faces just figured fighting for their country we cannot\nWe cannot commit American troops ever again unless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in the\n... so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allow the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual real to win\nIn addition to the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about uh Korea hero a trustee pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would occur James is\nThis is a man who was Kevin old before capital was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man who would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist off in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what does he do he had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh ... social on his his his his the scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight as new

com click on the radio icon but\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and flew on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the O. J. I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein\nRod Rosenstein who you are not and bring 'em in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than McCain memos and the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who said by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforced that we've subpoenaed that became memos and we've asked Mr Rosenstein\nDo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played shot he talked about ... he he talked about facts and and the here and it is and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly come answer our questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that your committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ...\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running dusted department should not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth ... Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the huge already happened in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a little menial leaks\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWhere you're writing I think not only were they leaking been aired of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out\nYou said they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated I I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies an application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony it is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDid they fail to read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed it out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know ... and as a result it was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they say that is correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there\nWere not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick thing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte do indicated that he would do that so now with your time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there\nAnswered these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane Michael pounding the panhandle [noise]\nWaiting of all those promises relieve F ...

into Washington's international entanglements the prince who supposedly order and the head\nIs the one that wants more western ideals in Saudi Arabia\n\nSo is he the bad guy because this year he had this reporter allegedly chopped up into you know easily microwave bits\n\nLike something out of only a James Bond movie could conceive is he a bad guy because he he was fighting for reforms that uh you know albeit not very\nFar down the road and certainly not equal rights for all here in a country where you know we we watch people jump up and down and yell at each other because we haven't passed

sometimes you know we're told by society that those rules are fair or whatever\n\nBut all humans in this country are viewed as created equal now as the government inserts self and tries to pick

years behind you of maybe not being as equal as somebody else may be working harder than somebody else so maybe by the time you and a bunch of other Eighteen year olds are old enough to read\nMaybe not being as equal as somebody else may be working harder than somebody else so maybe by the time you and a bunch of other Eighteen year olds are old enough to register to vote by the way the deadline

Saudi leader a despot in a country that's led by strict authoritarian despotism trying to western eyes a little bit\nBeing horribly castigated by a conservative faction in this country\nWho wants to stay eastern do stay Islamist\nSo his cars show gave the bad guy because he he says we should keep surreal law and women who shouldn't worry about how they take their picture on their driver's license because women should have driver's license is is he is a bad guy and if he's the bad guy did he deserved to be chopped up into your hamburger meat\nAllegedly this is what\nWashington was getting out when he was telling you about international entanglements human rights the rights of this Jamal ... to write\nWhat he writes and let the marketplace of ideas when out because the the other problem with what could show he was conservatively writing about was it was a world in which very few people had the right to have an opinion\n... and the women in that world often could be stoned to death maybe not chopped up maybe not even in secret sometimes in the town square\n\nAnd gay people ... so let's be careful who we paid is the good guy and the bad guy in this ... story\nBecause I think there are plenty of bad guys and the story but it reminds us about human rights and before you joined your next resistance march and run on now to the red head and to yell at some Trump official\nBefore before Maxine Waters emails you another time thinking second about what your fighting about versus some of these other places in the world where\nResistance\nWinds up in the other end

another or at least ... runs an industry he's got a manufacturing company he can speak to a little bit but\nBut in for the most part these guys are doing it for the for the notoriety ... and there was a line that an old ... song where he says somewhere notoriety got all mixed up with fame\nAnd and that's where we are as a society where we right now is is that being notorious is much better

me willy I work with these people all the time they have no idea why they're famous they just know they liked being famous so they're going to do anything and everything they can to stay being famous or so that a\nPositive way instead of a negative way they're still going to get the publicity\n... yeah but then there's a lot of work involved in it and and you know a\nHigh there's a chance somebody might not see you 'cause you're down in a basement running wires or or up in an addict laying insulation then maybe when the TV cameras show up you're not there are to be videotaped and and I'm Sorry

you know the celebrity politicking is a distraction around the idea of she wants to Medicaid for all and she wants you ah you know women's reproductive rights as opposed to responsibilities you know all these things that she doesn't want to discuss\nUm because she's got a celebrity there to distract attention and oh by the way let's not forget\nThat one of the celebrities is her daughter Olivia

playing out where\nI put out false news Yes sir and every other major uh that was what what do we say and I notice that\nAnd listen to what really matters in life and so what I'm noticing though as America is being transformed\nPresident Trump's doing the job by the way in my opinion and making America great again the more creature comforts we get the more we wanted to fight so I think that\nOne thing my plans it costs about all the time was the least of the caring about\nOthers even mud and you care about you know so when they're young people who are hungry starving or whatever we don't have so much they have you\nHere in America right now to care about others as much as we care about ourselves so\nThat for me is a definite goals and and having people consider the least of these as well even with this little prison farm cat reform campaign getting folks out of jail that really shouldn't be in there for life\nOr very small accidents are things that they've done so that that needs to be done in America\nBut I Am very excited or on the pro life right did you see that movie got snow\nOn the way we have a narrow and what else did you cry\nOn the pro life right did you see that movie got snow\nOn the way we have ... did you cry I actually cried\nI cried the euro that mankind can be so ... to to human life in general and and that you know I guess you know the the way it sort of sue born the psychotic you know break in the sky gone smell a ... abortion is or who knows just killing\nLive babies and and it was just the horrors I mean it was it was scarier than some of the made up Halloween movies that we see these days off either what that\nOne of my little guy's daughter when we went in a group and she was saying well you know I never really thought about it but when I saw what they were doing why didn't they just let the baby then stopped it\nWhy do they have to kill them she says so that gave me something to think about ... and I believe that it's as long as America continues to see some of these atrocities that some things you can't close your eyes to turn away from once you see them so I think is very important\nThat we keep broadcasting as you're doing or letting folks know about some of these atrocities in humanity and we're one black one ... and we're not even separate races all this racism and during that up but we've got to do what my article said\nWe must learn to live together as brothers that I'll say is that as well or parents together oh we don't want to perish so we need to start resolving these different\n... and and that's one of

of us\nYou mentioned President Trump Elvie to a ... real quick talk about the prison reform in and addressing some of the ... and the black community where he is growing leaps and bounds in popularity on before seen for a Republican president certainly but uh you know the the reforms and\nYou're you're talking about a with James or with or not to with um\nUm well ... but also a ah with some of the prison reform advocates the ... that were there at the meeting with the president talking about where he stands with that and and what you would like to see happening with that\nDuring the summer of twenty eight thing\nAt this the first I was at the White House with the president and that were Eighteen pastors and leaders and spiritual folks will do a lot of praying and everything and we were at the White House with the president I gave a list of folks that needed to be considered for prison reform myself\nI submitted that to the White House we're working very hard to\nSay people who were put in jail with two and three life sentences and that kind of thing for\nWhat used to be misdemeanors\nThe law was changed to make them selling to load the jails and that was done at the station or the Clinton Administration just to privatize the jails stack them with people and President Trump did say the other day recently oh we've got a lot of people out of jail a lot of that even needs to be in that we are going to let them out\nSo when he says something like that we should begin or continue to pray that that would be president reform and justice for the non violent offenders

Obama wouldn't do it that way or the other thing though and let me ask you about this and then we'll get to the book\nAnd that is in the nineties when ... when Clinton saw that his agenda was not going uh well he he did some course correction and said this isn't working for us we need to do a few things differently that will the left to be smart enough to do that as they see that these tactics are not working to their to their advantage\nYou see ... it's a it's an excellent question you're asking but I see it a little bit differently I don't think there is a left in America anymore I I think there is a progressive far left you know that has allied\nWith their um enablers in the media and who has crushed liberal people crush them so you're not seeing moderate Democrats\nSay a word there was a recent study done it says eight percent of Americans large are far less people\nBut that's what you hear you hear Bernie Sanders you hear ... she hear Cory Booker ... been worn yep you don't hear the moderates\nThe Democratic side and they are afraid of the far left the moderate Democrats are afraid because they know the far left as the media megaphone\nAnd so there really isn't a well will laugh learned its lesson\nBecause the far left will never stop they want a fundamentally different America and the moderate laps afraid of them so they're just gonna keep not saying anything how many Democrats large did you hear\nStick up for the presumption of innocence and due process and the Kavanaugh situation\nI Am really can't think of a single one that did and I think\nI Will either not and I researched it I researched it\nI uh I had my staff find me a Democrat and elect a Democrat that sticking up for the presumption of innocence in America now you know there are plenty of them\nBut they wouldn't say it because they're afraid of meat too they're afraid of a Soros they're afraid of Schumer\nAnd so they say nothing\nLet's talk about killing you\nHave and I think independent Americans are getting that maybe they're not getting it the way I laid out for you but they're saying you know there's something wrong you know and I think that'll show up in three weeks and I ...

got away because people like the red cross the American CIA\nElements of the Catholic Church help them help them get away can you believe it you know and then they had to be tracked down by very brave people because Odessa\nDo you think the Boston Globe's in her corner the originally reported that it was one five twelve at the foreign and then they had to issue a correction today and say is you said it's it may not be one five twelve to maybe one one thousand and twenty fourth\nI'm but why are they willing to play along with this game when they know that as you pointed out for employment law and EEOC you know equal Employment Opportunity commission\nThat none of this stuff even matters because it wouldn't hold up for those standards which are the standards of government a government that you may want to you know someday be president of that government\nThat's right the Boston Globe dating back to two thousand and twelve has essentially served\nAs Elizabeth Warren's press office they did this back into two thousand and twelve what she does she gives them exclusive access to family members exclusive access to documents and they run with her story line and they did it back in two thousand and twelve and they've done it multiple times in the last\nThree to four months as she's getting ready to run so what the Boston Globe didn't do here is what a responsible news organization would do they ... the first of all reviewed her actual DNA date and not just their report someone she hired\nConcluded they would have taken that data to another genealogist to another scientists who familiar with DNA and whatever verified this person's funding there is no indication they did that they simply took off the shelf\nOr a report she commissioned and she obtained which even on its face is almost laughable that she might be one one thousand Native American based on a DNA database\nWhich doesn't even include Native Americans in it or this is is really preposterous and the and the issue becomes why did she do this and we know the reason she did it she didn't claim to be Native American when she was a child\nShe didn't claim to be Native American lands she applied to college or law school it was only in her mid to late thirties when she was climbing the law professor ladder\nFrom University of Texas\nAll the way up to Harvard law school that she listed herself as being Native American it was known she list to herself for each Yossi filing purposes that way and lo and behold when she finally get tenure at Harvard law school essentially the top rung on the ladder you can't go any higher than that uh\nShe stopped supporting herself as native America\nAs I should get high right there at that point well now\nDo you see this creating a real problem for her because as much as I think she's been a punchline nachos for conservatives but even for the president of the United states um and now having dumped this additional piece of data is no well I can show this one one thousand but now you have to believe me\nIt almost seems to me that there's going to make her more of a punch line there appear folk tourist adjusting that Donald Trump would promised ... million dollars if you could prove to his Native American ought to send one one thousand and twenty fourth of a million dollars to Elizabeth Warren and say OK bet settled\nAnd the Cherokee Nation issued a statement late today complaining and blaming fasting her and saying quote Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her\nLate today complaining and lame fasting car and saying quote Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nClose quote and they then go on to say that you cannot use DNA as a test\nIt died demeaning to Native Americans there's a lot more to tribal membership in tribal inclusion than DNA and the DNA is totally inappropriate to use for their purposes and they don't use it and so what she has done is she has\nCreated to thing she thought she was going to settle this problem instead she made herself laughing stock\nAnd two she is actually forced Native American and this is the unofficial tribal statement from the Cherokee Nation saying that she is undermining their interest by or continue\nContinued claims of tribal heritage so I think she made her situation a lot worse than it was the question I've always had for her\nWhich is we know what happened here she tried to cheat sheet try to rig the system for herself why doesn't she just apologize what is the personality problem that she has that she will not simply apologize and I get a lot of her supporters like policies\nOkay it's kind of left wing politics and they're willing to excuse it but very few people I Believe actually believe her when she says these things they may be willing to use it\nIf they like her politics but I don't think anybody believes her and I think what she doesn't realize if people are laughing at her not with her and what she has done here which is ludicrous DNA test she should have come out and said I had my DNA tested it's such a miniscule\nFraction at at you know one one thousand you know I really never should have claimed it I didn't know this before but now I Do apologize to the Cherokee people and to other Native Americans it would have created a little bluster for a week or two but you know what it would have served in much better you know I think people have to ask why won't she just apologize\nAnd it's got to be an ego problem ... professor Jacobson from a legal interaction you know

I had a lot of the problems I felt terrible I saw him in the weight room today he said to him who you know I got to get back in here a little bit you know you kind of knock me on my tail off\nI was pretty impressed with your vertical jumping ability that was number one and then number two I thought well this is the ACC can review this for targeting yeah are you get suspended for half yeah wouldn't surprise\nMe I mean it's really a miracle that nobody was injured and the filming of a stunt but the fact that I didn't pull a hamstring or a calf muscle alternative jump up and down as minor miracle and\nI'm really felt bad like I just was really happy and bud was happy and like I really do not mean to\nUm to to take him to the ground there but um it was all fun\nUp people have no idea the time that you guys spend all season long all year long offseason in the ... just in a moment like that to be able to celebrate with everybody there and the chaos in the locker room I that's one of the cool things about coaching absolutely yeah and I so I Try and tell her kids is is it's never about\nUs like we don't we don't walk around patting each other on the back it's about the kids because we see so much more of these kids and what they sacrifice and the work that they put in and we want them to have success you feel a tremendous sense of um\nOf ownership and trying to make sure that they have a positive experience and when they come through and times of struggle which I think you know where everybody always tries to draw parallels between football in life and the bottom line is

parallels between sport in life in terms of\nWorking hard and going through adversity and infighting through and the bottom line was our guys continue to just play the next play and they didn't give up and things aren't going to go always the way you want them to go but you know in life and as a sport you know you got to find a way to go play the next play to the best of your ability and our guys\nDid that in a very tight situation of a tough hard situation and the sea and pull through you know you lose a little bit of ... you don't care about how you look or were you know you know if there's a camera on you or anything you're just happy and you're happy for them and excited for the kids and sit back in the locker room and watching them celebrates really special\nAnd coach I Know you'd you'd love to go out and whenever a game by five touchdowns but that's not the reality of this business is not the reality of that level in that moment what you were just talking about when they are facing adversity not only that but doing it on the road and then show the poise and the maturity that they did down the stretch our you almost even more proud of them in those moments than you are in lopsided wins\nYeah we're certainly not you know particularly this year I mean they're not going to have any of those games and that's just where we're at I mean we've seen this coming for several years now and you know our first couple of years we played a few games that that you know there were lopsided in our favor but\nThat's not happening this year we're going to have to battle tooth and nail throughout the entire time and you know we we got in a close game\nUm versus oh do you and I felt like as a team we panic a little bit and we were in this similar situation at North Carolina and we did not panic or did not flinch we continue to play the next play and trust in what we're doing and and ultimately you know find a way to pull it out when\nNo what were your pressures when you went there and you saw the field for the first time with the new turf and when did you realize that it was just put down in the day before and did you have any concerns about it\nWell I didn't know that I if I'm not mistaken and again I'm not if I'm not mistaken I think they've got some work being done on their head Oregon practice facility and they had been practicing in the stadium and I didn't know\nThat they were reciting the middle of the fuel I didn't know how it's going to work or what was going to be like I didn't think it was a big issue when we got out there and saw it I mean maybe aesthetically it didn't look you know what you would have to pay a field to look like but\nI didn't feel like it was a huge issue throughout the game for either side I thought they did as good a job as it could of getting in the field ready to play and I thought it was perfectly fine that\nGo to Justin ... is with us this is talk live we've got the coach the majority of the hour we continue to

partners wherever aspect of your agribusiness enterprise were there for you\nUm you know it concerned me 'cause on the run that because the formal he got like a yards you know what I mean it wasn't like we hit the guy in the backfield in the bowl when\nWhen spraying out I mean he was down the field I mean they were we knew they were going to be ready we really did like I Know there are record is not what\nEverybody you think about talking about distractions and things that they've been through in terms of suspensions and all sorts of things so um you know I think they're they're they're kind of rounding out now I'm you know the big thing is question with him has been their quarterback like and they\nTake care of the football so I didn't feel like that was that was the issue of you know when we took we were told an interception it bounces off a receiver\nAnd and get picked on a on what should be a good play and you know we just we had a couple of positions we didn't play very well or very efficiently and I'm In it and it hurt us and made it made everything else harder and we're not good enough to overcome those things are at this point\nI'm a host torn between two questions coach 'cause you're not two things I wanted to get you know when to circle back to my question about Ryan will as you mentioned they've been going through a lot of things with the suspensions Molly Carney was not expected to return in that game it's a big deal because he's arguably their best defensive player we learned in the pre game that he was going to play when did you guys learn and how does that impact the game\nWell when he was out there for warmer it's obviously we look at all those things but we had planned\nUm that that he was going to serve as a his suspension in that game is everything that we knew he was going to and then we're talking about there and warm ups and\nJust decided I guess he's going to play so [laughter] we better go but you know it didn't I mean he's a very very good player don't get me wrong I mean there are better on defense when he's out there there's no question about that but um\nYou know I don't I don't know how it all worked out its you know really kind of not my business but um but I Know he was out there and warm out specific ready\nI Know that the press conference today talked about you are a little disappointed in the run game and obviously they struggled in the second quarter with whatever was nine yards and that might have been like what did you see that maybe recalls and some of those issues in the run game\nYeah we didn't there's two things really is it's kind of like I'm a\nChain reaction you know ... they did some things um after having a little extra time in terms of movement that we didn't handle particularly well I'm up front and made some adjustments and and\nKind of you know got had an answer for that as the game went on and then you know they played us in some more want to hire extra player in the box and we we had some very what I Would consider routine plays that we didn't make that could never threaten them\nWith what they were doing and had a hard time getting them out of it which kinda led to our struggles I mean between them the movement and us not threatening them with what they were trying to do there was no reason for them to to have to do much more\nBut between them the movement in us not threatening them with what they were trying to do there was no reason for them to to have to do much more\nOne running played that will be remembered fondly though was of course Ryan will is a scramble and for the Ninety picks up twelve yards there is a noticeable difference we were kind of having some fun at the end of the game talking about Ryan going into a slide a little bit early he went ahead first on that one and that was by design that the Andy Dalton dive is you're told Mike after the game\nYeah we've got him on the Andy Dalton dive tape Andy was a quarterback and TCU and he was the best I've ever seen\nAt ... you know finding a way to get down on the ground head first when there's a little a little bit of room in their cars you actually get more yards that way and you're a little bit less exposed but you've gotta you gotta have a little savvy in there to do it and so we've kept a\nUm for lack of a better term Andy Dalton dive tape that we keep for our guys to watch of him run on the ball and not taking shots and getting on the ground head\nFirst and he almost got in for the touchdown there late too but that would have given more time so it worked out great well it all worked\nOut fine at the end but yeah it was it was a precarious situation there was no time outs and you know I couldn't tell if he got you can't see anything on my ass on the field I mean I've got no idea if he's in it or not and I'm trying to look at the\nBoard then they've got a player down and we've got no more no more time out I don't remember how much time was left on the clock ... want to say yes twenty seconds or so left on the clock but you've got all these downs to play with but not very much time\nSo you know we talk with fortunately we had a little bit of time there to talk it out you know it\nAll the years you've had football you ever been through what you went through there with an Eighteen play drive to win the game like that and\nOh I don't know I've been to I've been through a couple of drives like that at the end of the game um were last year ... was defense but all fence yeah um you know I don't know that it's ever been\nNine Ninety eight or ... or whatever it was with that many conversions and and all that sort of stuff with a touchdown to win the game I don't I don't I don't recall ever that happening\nAs a coach said it all worked out fine in the end of it keeps

decision to rugby style a handful of punch from that point for\nYeah sure we you know there's a couple of things that went into his success and it's something that we've been concerned about first of all he's a talented return or\nSecond of all we wanted to rugby style a little bit to keep the ball out of his hands and and try and use ugly as that looks\nWhen the ball rolling into ran down there it is really effective um when used properly it's like anything else like sugar too much of anything is a bad for you sprinkle a little bit you can you can\nMake a little hey with it but you know we

clubs been really fun and um I tried to get back as quick as that good from our team meeting in our meetings or last night but couldn't but um I think they had all kinds of events three legged racism fireworks\nAnd the whole nine yards sound like a pretty good time\nSomeone earlier asked me in and there was a rumor that Charlotte may have one that's related raised salmon substantiated that\nJohn sure she would tell you that she did even though she didn't but ... whatever she did she came down sick like she ran so fast she's that's why they're not here tonight she's under the weather so she's not fit for public a display that they shouldn't slept\nMuch watching in the NFL game last night to argue and then I felt like I Am a\nI'm a I'm a football fan um I watched a little bit of it and you know when I'm watching the game\nAnd in the first time it crosses my mind that I'd rather be asleep than watch anymore this is when I just click it off and go to sleep so I watched a little bit of it well that guy from Cincinnati I mean from Kansas City my gosh holy cow or they look good on I'll get some fast receivers oh my God they can they can run now\nWill coach you're often gets the job done dramatic fashion I was curious during fund with flu what is your phone look like when you finally get around and looking at it after a game like that\nOr it's full of of tax and you know mostly congratulations course when you had the added um [noise] a\n... video yeah are you tackling the defensive coordinator adds to the number of text messages and smart alec comments that you get there are various relatives and all our friends and buddies and stuff like\nThat yeah I Know you have people in the NFL that that coach obviously that's something that down the road you think that you'd ever want to do obviously it's totally different game players in recruiting and you had guys like saving and yeah earlier that will go to the NFL and come back either I don't\nI've never really I've had one or two opportunities to talk to somebody about that a earlier in my career a it was it was not anything I was really all that interested in quite honestly you know the developmental side and the coaching side and the involvement in the kids\nUm something that I Am still drawn to here and I really really like I just um you know and I I have some good friends that are that are in the NFL they're really enjoy it but it's all it's it's only football\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that but well I like what we do in terms of trying to help people um get better and develop and you know obviously there's a there's some things that come with that you're always on call and all those sorts of things but you know maybe\nOne day when I was much much older and you know the other thing is to like I'm a I'm not picking on any ... any cities but I'm not dying to go live in a big old you know New York you know I really am not in calling on my first choice I'd much rather be home in Blacksburg ...\nIs with us it's fun with to cut you mentioned sleep there last night at the exact same thing by the way watching the game like now I'm Out at halftime but we've kinda been on that same night game deal and you know we joke about it but I kind of messes with the schedule after a number of weeks in a row\nNo question like you ... you come rolling in three thirty four in the morning like I don't know\nAbout it but that kind of messes with the schedule after a number of weeks in a row\nNo question you should come rolling in three thirty four in the morning\nLike I don't I haven't found a good way to sleep on a bus yeah like I tried every position every every movement\nEverything I can to try and fall asleep and I just I haven't been able to do a very good job of that\nSo you know you get in there three thirty four in the morning and you're still a little bit wound up and he finally drift off to sleep and oh Charlotte touched on the shoulder about six fifty wants to play and uh so you're often run in there a couple of hours later I Know you love to fish what's what's your favorite thing to catch\nAnd do you catch it and keep it and eat it or you always told that I'm
