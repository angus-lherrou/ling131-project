a lot of us we look at China and we see China as a country that wants to be a militarily preeminent on planet earth and they want to be economically preeminent\nUh I think that they would they would like to replace the United states\nAs the biggest single economic player on the globe and the biggest some single military player on the globe and uh I I don't think they're taking the prisoners when they started creating artificial islands\nYou're on the globe and the biggest ... single military player on the globe and I I don't think they're taking any prisoners when they started creating artificial islands and they start to up to push a bit\nAgainst us and say don't come near us or that sort of thing so I thought we talked about that was ... who's the author of bully of Asia why China's dream is the new threat to the world order\nEven the sounds like you and I are both on the same side on here on this issue but how big is the threat that our country faces from a China\nWell the threat from China and plenty Eighteen is like the threat from the Soviet Union in Nineteen sixty or Nineteen Seventy at the height of the Cold War when we were afraid that the Soviet Union had more troops more missiles\nAnd a faster growing economy than we did\nI it turned out that they did have more troops in more missiles but the economy was uh was largely exaggerated and when President Reagan took power\nWas elected president or a man that I think the greatest president of the twentieth century um eight he turned up the heat on the Soviet Union and it gradually collapse\nOr and I think we have a president now is turning up the heat on China and China is facing the same kind of a systemic collapse if we can keep the pressure on if we can keep the Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi is from a\nGrabbing the levers of power and the Trump be Trump I think we'll win this thing\nI like to remind people ski but then you back me up or or correct me if I'm wrong\nThat while we have a large national debt the national debt in terms of gross domestic product that China has makes ours look small by comparison and China at some point he was going to have to come to grips with the fact that they do an awful lot of money that they have a\nA a huge amount of debt and and they're very dependent on the rest of the world because\nThat's where the goods made in China are sold for the most part\nNot to their own domestic population\nYeah you couldn't be more correct because the only sector of the Chinese economy\nThat actually runs a profit is the export sector\nAnd the export sector runs a profit because they have largely until recently I have had unfettered access to the largest consumer market in the world\nWhich is the United states the rest of the socialist planned economy of China is is a nightmare of wasted money wasted resources a bridge to nowhere roads that no one uses and and so forth buildings stand empty\nSo if we can cut off their easy access to the American consumer market\nOr their economy made a limp along for a while but you're right they've got debt or we don't know exactly how much debt they have actually it's it's at least three hundred percent three times the annual gross domestic product so they spent every any that they made for the next three years they might be able to pay off the debt they might not so they've got a huge huge debt\nTo carry around and and that's one of their weaknesses\nWhereas in the United states by comparison we have a a a gross domestic product of around ... trillion dollars and the national debt around twenty trillion ours is a hundred percent of GDP your gp theirs is three times the size proportionately\nYeah and our economy is now I think growing faster than China's now you wouldn't you wouldn't think that from looking at the official figures\nBut look the official figures in China are nonsense every year uh see gene thing the new red emperor comes out with a plan saying we're going to get six point one percent economic growth this year and every province every city in China reports six point one percent except a few very ambitious party officials\nReport six point two or six point three or six forty four percent but the ...\nChina report six point one percent except a few very ambitious party officials\nReport six point two or six point three or six forty four percent but the real growth is probably down at two or three percent we're growing out over four percent so the gap between the U.S and China is not narrowing is actually widening because we've turned on the great engine of American Capitalism and it's running at full speed\nI'm Talking to Stephen ... who's the author a bully or Beijing wide trying his dream is the threat new threat to the world order\nAt some point do when the numbers they give out publicly and and it kind of reminds me is I think it did you know the old Soviet Union where they would announce that we're going to harvest fifty million bushels of wheat or whatever the number was\nAnd they would only harvest forty and for domestic consumption they just go back and change the numbers and say well we were planning to harvest thirty eight and we came in and forty you can run those kinds of games on your domestic population as long as you control information that comes into them\nBut is it still possible to do that and have people actually believe what the government is telling them in an Internet age\nWell you know the the Chinese have built all over the centuries but they now have built a great fire wall in an effort to keep information and news from the outside world from percolating into China and I think it's it's it's partly successful things get posted on the Internet are\nCritical of the government they get taken down literally Lars within seconds\nWithin seconds or and so you know they they've got banks and banks of of computer terminals\nAnd and many in sitting in front of them making sure that\nThat know criticism of the party of the military of the government and above all of of the new red emperor seizing thing gets posted on the Internet now we try to do an end run around that back in the early nineties I was on the presidential commission that set up Radio Free Asia which is our radio broadcast service\nThat broadcast news and information about what's really happening in China\nBack into China to do an end run around the street controlled media and I think that's been fairly fairly successful over the years ah yeah the information information lease and they don't have a an absolute monopoly on news the way they did and the Soviet Union back in the thirties went oh my goodness style and killed\nFour million people in Ukraine and ended up having a a a a manipulated a deliberate famine to kill off the rich cousins and no one on the outside world knew about it the Wilder drowsy the New York times saying that everyone is well fed and the Soviet Union there's no starvation millions of people were starving to death at that time\nSo how how long can they maintain this this pretend that they have all the success when all of the people generating the fake numbers are are in on the secret and it's no longer a secret in other words if you're saying everybody should report six percent growth\nAnd ... you must have multiple people in each of those provinces saying make the numbers look the way the president wants them to walk but everybody involved in creating those numbers knows they're fake\nYeah well they do it and and uh the the the premier or not the current one but the previous one admitted this a Premier Wen Jiabao ten years ago he said I really don't pay any attention to the numbers\nBecause they're all fabricated he said I really look at the uh the number of containers are being shipped from Shanghai to the United states I really look at uh the electrical power that we're using I really look at the rail traffic\nHe said that gives me a sense of how the economy's really doing the numbers he said don't matter so I thought that was a rare moment of ender on the part of Chinese officials\nAre I'd just even in the last minute\nThe numbers he said don't matter but that was a rare moment of ... on the part of Chinese officials\nAre I'd just even in the last minute what's the best way for the United states to react to this to counter it if necessary and to take on the bully of Asia\nWell to do exactly what President Trump is doing he's a he's a deal here he is going from from issue to issue getting the best deal he can and and getting as many concessions as again and then moving out of the net or the Chinese the Trump the strategic they're terrified of it\nIs pressuring China economically but also militarily an ideologically as well and and I think his goal and it should be to to prevent China for replacing the United states is the dominant power in the world of the world under the U.S as a safer or more democratic place than it would be under China I think everybody would agree with that\nSteven it's always a pleasure thanks so much and congratulations on the success of bully of Asia why ... dream as the new threat to the world order we appreciate your time denied\nSo and their habits so showing that those are increasing and does\nAre increasing and does have a quite a steady slow about a week to ten days before so people do you watch a little more they just make up their mind and they noticed that they're right there and they they go in and vote early or any\nBut some of the things they are discovering are quite an use which is why does that millennials are are dropping off dramatically they don't\nParticipate so much in early voting because they're too many steps you have to often applied to get an application to cast a ballot you have to fill it out you have to sometimes you know states like their Social Security number or have you put down your\nYour proper dress and then you have to find a stamp and envelope at a box and these are steps that you know millennials just really can't sue\nNow do you believe that ... ... ... I'm Wondering what the result has been with millennials in states like especially Oregon I mean I happen to my broadcast studios there but one of the disturbing things I've seen is that they have automatic registration too often I hear from parents who say my sixteen year old daughter is registered to vote\nAnd I said yeah she can't vote till she's Eighteen but they do it automatically when you get a driver's license\nWhen you make it that easy where\nThe minute you get government id or whether it's a driver's license or an ID card you're registered you get a ballot then once you turn Eighteen he comes in the mail whether you ask for it or not\nAnd all you have to do is pick it up open it up market put it back in the envelope and send it back when they make that easy do millennials still drop off or do they vote in greater numbers\nI bought I I'm not sure they had the data yet on things like that we really are in the beginning faces as a new experiment and uh but I I Will speak of ours I don't know if you realize this but I was a county chair at one point and I and very well versed on how you register voters and how you uh\nGet people on the ballot and things like that but uh I think when you drop a\n... a ID and I'm a registered in a in a location where you are permanent resident you get voter fraud yeah I mean you're going to have ballot\nAs a male to people who don't live there who at one point lived there so there is no way to verify who that person is so it was right base rate where you have voter id you go in on election day and they see your driver's\nLicense and they eat your uh and they match it up on a some kind of voter roll and that does a a provide security level to ensure that the people who say\nThey say are voting are actually voting and ah I I Do think as we I asked us election and we're still trying to figure out some of the cyber security issues\nTo secure our voting system I Do think we are going to go again back at this issue of\nUs who is voting and a ... a cure\nI saw the just today the LA Times broke a story saying that the DMV in the department of motor vehicles in California has admitted there were twenty three thousand registration mistakes including a Canadian citizen who got notified he's lived in California but he was notified he was newly registered to vote\nHe does have a California driver's license\nBut he's not a citizen the United states citizen to Canada according to the LA Times and he said I Know I'm not going to vote I'm not allowed to vote but that won't necessarily apply to everyone if you've been living in California for Thirty years in Europe for national and somebody sends you a notice sais says you can vote\nI imagine some people will simply take the opportunity even though doing good he was committing a crime they apparently had tens of thousands of these kinds of mistakes just in the state of California where they do have\nSimply take the opportunity even though doing it is committed a crime they apparently had tens of thousands of these kinds of mistakes just in the state of California where they do have automatic registration and where they are giving drivers' licenses to both legal and illegal aliens\nAnd eight so I Can't give you another missile at eight twenty Thirteen land or air uh like Bloomberg was a complete search or he\nHad two hundred people in the department of education is go out in the twenty Thirteen Years race and so as dead people and sixty one out of the two hundred could vote as a dead person ... stuff and uh and so if\nThat is what happens is a New York is not a voter id state so people can walk in and they are very they're sticking your church and why does on a what\nDoes the list and so without voter I get people he knows he uh you know people will argue whether there is a voter fraud and uh he he had a way to prove that you know that there that people could vote\nUnbelievable Adele it is a pleasure to have you on the program I really appreciate you taking the time to stay on the story of a feeling that this election is going to produce some interesting results and it may not be all that comforting to those of us who consider voting a rite of citizens and when we find out that people who are non citizens are able to vote thank you\nSo much for having a\nYou bought a Dell mal parents who is a national political

I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nOut and yell believe it or not firefighter a definitely make more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay\nUm and you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that ... there's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into to just\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except to slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time 'cause I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done me up and they don't charge not worth that much yeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo no you're right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you've got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and get a counselor actually\nA fork St those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a lot and that we're at\n... aircraft gotcha not even a\nYet but um I mean I I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those ... or ... ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get an hour here\nThings like that to kinda do get those ... or ... or ... a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get and our air and our there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours for dessert to eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a waste of a you know on the cheap you can get 'em at two fifty or three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know show\nBecause you know twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much pretty much and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level um ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more\nAnd so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely ... passionate yeah why not I I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah I mean I I've got a ... I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and uh and and also I burn through some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them I Try and make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this was not going to cost you money is actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand much of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something\nLike that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody

you will that they make related going back to that with the rising\nAnd then I think what was surprising was that a lot hasn't things in terms of the kinds of or rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you hang around with and she on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial buddy here's what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again the it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations and and every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and different that not caring about what other than driving and buying and wearing is a really key factor in building well you know it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore what other people are doing research will media and so forth but it continues to be there are just not hearing about what other people is unreal that it is one of the way it goes well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits going broke what I'd do it in my twenties where his mind\nIt is one of the wave itself out\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits of going broke like I did in my twenties where his violently was on ... ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor\nTo me personally to be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves\nThen you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like he said I think that that on Facebook version of that is a lot different than what's going on and I live here so that something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and I researched\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest in grow will that is a great word come closer to grow wealth what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know study that related to make more than one that comes fine mess that it really you know you could apply any kind of major financial decision they are making a few\n... kind of Congo before making this decision so I you know the example we get sometimes there's\nGoing to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not a skier and an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is that he can stay calm and come as\nA matter what the financial ... bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I I often here we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that lifestyle related freedom\nDoes not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually which to greater and greater will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding back looking at your passion or or your interests let's say for your career has me grounded in some kind of reality and and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if you had an accent for the arts and that's really where you want your career to go out and we had to take that with the reality is that mean certain things are going to have to be set aside\nFor that kind of again it's a ... a lot of I don't want to hear but um we often have been here since ... you\nKnow there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does it accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that's one of the things that we can't thing over and over again and again whatever time out millionaires or those that are on their way to becoming a millionaire but\nThat time than planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your whole life and not you know keeping your head and and um that that relates to building off every time the that specifically and of course go do it while\nWe're talking with Dr Sarah ... of um I'm I'm from mispronouncing your last night on site correctly\nSo la la la la la la la yeah it's\nI told me he had one on there and are still mess it up there I'm so sorry law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you hadn't you

nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or that free scream and I'm like she knows

Boyer who's had some suspicion problems in his race unraveled he hits the wall\nThat unfolds a chain of events that basically takes on the role of victory lean and he ends up crashing on only only only over time\nThere and then of course chase Elliott with no tires in the front hose off a couple of guys with two tires and gets a big waiting for the racing so what a I mean first three hundred three hundred lap three twenty five nothing the last Seventy five\nFour or five different storylines unfolded right there in front of area\nYeah I mean I guess you know unfortunately for Kevin horrific but fortunately for the fans at home watching that bell valve stem issue that are his tier change your hat led to a more exciting right because otherwise here lately he would have you know ran away with it and we would have been sitting here talking about you know him getting another way\nAnd what about the range of emotions that Rick ... must have sat through yesterday okay so Jimmy Johnson how much talk and we had about the role of all in the last lap\nYou attempt at a pass and he threw away his change the race for a championship and all that so now you go back to a place at Dover Jimmy Johnson got what do you live in ... at the racetrack so you got to say\nIf there's like ... if there is a NASCAR God overseeing this raised Jimmy Johnson is going to reclaim some of the gory did win number twelve because now it wouldn't matter ... you'll get that when\nAnd he's in the garage with a ball joint issue you lower about drawing malfunction before they even take the green flag incredible so then but I tell you during the course of the race the forty eight Carl was fast although he was to let down the ADA Carl was fast\nThe man was average to better than average and they end up getting getting the winds of overall a positive they entered motor sports\nOther than the air you know ended up\nAs the best of times it was the first time I just want to mention and this doesn't really have anything to do with yesterday's race but we've talked about Jimmy Johnson and his troubles this year\nHe's been able to keep a sense of humor about things you know after everything that happens all the shopping spree at everything that happened at the role of what the last lap and him and true ex getting together you know a cold per and had said earlier and the week while you know maybe he should go out and buy our whole team rode bikes to make up for this issue well Jimmy takes that\nYou know with a grain of salt and it goes you know what I'm going to do that I'm going to go to Walmart I'm going to buy however many ah ladies are aligned Earl it'll girls bikes gives him to the team and they had some fun with that so I you know yes he has had a terrible season but he's also been able to\nYou know he hasn't really gotten some other drivers we've seen have seasons like that and just spiral you know out of control and just really get down on their locking down on themselves but he's been able to\nAvoid that somewhat and keep a sense of humor\nI tell you something to the ... stood out to me and I mentioned this yesterday I'm not sure if you guys got a chance to see it would have all the stuff that happened here at the rose bowl and all that I watched ... junior being interviewed by somebody with NBC over the weekend\nIn a week removed they asked him\nYour assault have you talked to Jimmy ... that was the best interview\nWe can in a week removed they asked him\nYour thoughts have you talked to Jimmy ... that was the best interview and what I Would play\nFor any kid girl little boy whether your race or whatever kind of sport you're in\nOn how to handle yourself like a champion basically the ... the the question was have you in Jimmy talk a week removed your thoughts and ... was like I Love Jimmy Johnson you know he is a champion\nYou know I'm just I was upset at the time not that he attempted to make the move but the fact that he screwed up and you know you don't have any problem with Jimmy going forward I get it\nYou know Jimmy's you know he talked about what Jimmy had meant to him and how he had kind of cloned his character and you know it it was just a really a good perspective from a guy a week later that you know or that I Would\nI'm OK in that interview in you know I've got some little go court racers and I'm bringing up through the ranks you know girls and boys and like okay\nThis is how you need to be able to\nPut things to rest as a champion and move on and I thought that we that that interview with with Martin over the weekend before the race even started yesterday was was just a\nOne of the other things jumped out at me and I maybe I'm very close and Lexus and I both are very close to the fire here in Charlotte motor speedway PR ins studios are here were associated with that said my it's still a week later\nYeah for sure and and just like you said if they're able to go into Talladega and get a when I'm you know when when their way into the next round than they are going to be an even bigger threat nobody thought I certainly didn't think that ... was going to be the one the first one is the way into the next round for sure I'm In Talladega could show us another surprise when Eric that show us a a brackets lousy for sure but\nWhen it gets to homes that I think absolutely Kevin ... is a favorite but that team has to not be that South because I think to win the championship you have to wait and homes that and you can lead every lap and still have a house down there finished sixth and you're not the champion that's ... that's ...\nWith at fourteen yeah of all the races they want you can probably double that number right as far as how many they could have one had they not had\nNot always avail name or mechanical easy sometimes it's just a bad pit stop right All right and wrong time and then all the whatever the case may be that team is too good and the problem is they're as good as they are\nThey're not good enough like yesterday you get back in traffic and Kevin you know made up a few spots but he's out front and gone and you put him back in tents and he's struggling to get back to six or seven is just the clean air means so\nIt's it's the same thing with good football teams a lot of times they only lose when the beat themselves I return over stupid penalties and and and they have that they turned the ball over\nAnd and you guys know this but it's hard to get the casual fan to understand if I'm Kevin ... children are from how Bush or if I'm ... I work on my car all weekend\nTo race up front towards clean air because that's where I'm going to be you know I'm all probably qualified and the top four or five and I'm going to be up front and that's how I I work on my car in practice to prepare for where I think I'm going to raise and then you get cycle back on a restart in your tent ...\nIt's a completely different set of circumstances you don't have that balance and the all the things you need to to to to do what you got to do so any kind of situation like that really hurts those front running cars more so than people think because they are they have been worked on to run up front\nAll right we're going to take a timeout we'll be talking with a highly chain of NASCAR dot com and we will also ah have her ... her story time coming up on this edition of fastball\n\nAn adult down effect can weigh up to six times the average person a hundred and fifty pounds ever heard of car fentanyl it's a large wild animal tranquilize [noise]\nIllegal drug dealers lace heroin with it\nIt can kill the average human if you are a Lamborn is addicted to opiates even pain pills [noise] don't wait until it's too late coma detox and treatment help line now we care many of us have been where you are\nWill take you or a loved one away from the drug environment to place you can clean out safely plus we'll work with your insurance\nWe'll take Huron Lamborn away from the drug environment to a place you can clean out safely plush will work with your insurance company to make sure you get the treatment you need and with a family medical leave act you're allowed by law to get away for help without telling your employer why ... ... to save a life\nEight hundred nine one five nine seven three for eight hundred nine one five nine seven three four hundred nine one five Ninety seven thirty four\nI'm Kevin Harvard and you're listening to talk on the performance racing network\nThrough the years wife was ... honey it's a boy and down [noise] really broke the neighbors window up I'm so proud of what is going to college and down the shore\nThe life you can trust that if there's enough\nThere will be years down the same goes for Blue Ridge doors standing behind the reliability of their doors going up and down for three years whether you're a contractor with numerous projects or a homeowner who was a single garage doors is which is why you know the door you've only\nBeen setting the standards in Nineteen eighty four with the garage door from Blue Ridge doors you can trust that any down most certainly be followed by enough [noise]\nCongratulations to our families first Dr\n\nMore frequent visits Blue Ridge stores dotcom I'm Kevin Harvey and your body excitement among\nCup series last year by Charlie Chevrolet you're on the real Seventy five and twelve sixteen Wu ...\nUp this coming weekend Talladega wildcard racial I'm ... I'm Doug rye stolen by Alexis Eric ... and her me Sadler we're going to go to our guest hotline now where\nWe will have one of the most respected scribes NASCAR garage Joe and is currently works with NASCAR wire services Holly chain Holly thanks a lot from time to be on with it\nAnd carry on the on the housing going fantastic before would jump into specifics give us your uh your hot\nTakes following the Dover ratios we'd get ready to head to Talladega\nWow wow and wow okay [laughter]\nThat was quite an ending or here um\nAnd and quite a change that what the point tanning work like you know maybe only thirty minutes before the ending of that race they were completely different so I think it's quite ironic we're heading holiday there were so everyone can better be such a wild card re kind of hard to cook\nAnd I feel like we can kind of came out of out of the cake Eliot certainly is always a favorite at over a tablet himself though not surprising that he wind\nHowever I think it's kind of thing for him at the driving that we see go on that level you know had acted ran so it'll be interesting okay that ... that\nHighly dug and I was speaking earlier tonight this is harming by the way good to have your own um her yeah um you know ... got a couple of wins\nA Ryan blaming one here's a ... couple of weeks ago of all those drivers ready to challenge the Kevin horrific Cindy a cow Bush's ...\nMe one use a robust couple of weeks ago all of those rubber ready to challenge the juvenile reaching the bushes and amongst shoes each of them for changes when we get them to\nYou know I think that's a great question and uh you would certainly think experience and uh the resume that you know Martin and Kevin in Kyle us have turned into season specifically would would make them the odds on favorite to and I believe they are but I also feel like\nThere's a group going on but some of these younger drivers and they're hitting it right now and frankly this is when you need to be heading right this is the classes is when everything count so I Am very and treat the what happens and you know what I get a win under your belt and it only gets even more jacked up and I think these guys are their teams\nAre feeling a sense of confidence that I Would argue they didn't necessarily have an season's pass so I think it's created just a wonderful opportunity and and going to be some you know even more excitement for that than\nHi Holly I'm a you know you mentioned drivers that are in a groove there are a few drivers that are are definitely not in a groove of\nJimmy Johnson who could go since two thousand and to be the first season that he doesn't get a win Denny Hamlin um has had a when every season since two thousand six he could very easily go when I'm you know what's what's your take on that and and and is this\nPossible it seemed impossible to us but here we are you know five races from the end ah six races from the end of the year and and it's entirely possible\nWhy because morning I uh\nI I it is hard to believe that however\nI and I don't know maybe I'm Crazy to hold on to this but I still would not be surprised to see either of them went even perhaps at Talladega this week uh it is totally surprising that they come this far into the season and how that one I think Jimmy really went for it obviously at the table\nAnd that ... has been there but not something\nThat he hasn't been able to uh to get it done but I still feel like these are two drivers with the Senate anyone thinks they can't win is when they do any ... any any of their competitors that are that are taking them lightly I think that would be a huge mistake but\nI think there are Venus and I think we see at least one of them when it's not too and I know that sounds crazy because they're not in the playoffs that I think that could really happen and I bet you the playoff drivers think that as well\nBombing let's through another name in there that is over on the seasons we had done the last stretcher and that's called Larsen B\nBoth NATO has led along has looked at shouting at times but she finished one of these things on the do you hope that he can find a way to get to forty due to the one\nI really do and I believe you had six runner up finish it and I don't know at this point if you if you're ... you find that more encouraging more for acting you know to have been that close so many times he has another one that ah\nThat I think it's going absolutely going to have to win and I remember if it was last year the year before sitting there at Kansas with him when he had such a high points lead and we thought there is no way is not going to advance the next round and had engine problems and didn't\nIt's another Sessler story [noise] All right so I don't know how\nI'm going to follow the story [laughter]\nI have some ... a hot tub stores but they're not fit for ... yeah or they did not involve the deck falling and those kind of probably a good yeah um you know so\nIn our family and the kind of the big story line and race in going on is that my brother elite is retiring at the end of the season\nSo most people may think that you know Eliot Sadler\nA long time veteran of NASCAR had a successful career\nHe must have been just dynamite he dynamite driver his whole life right\nNo kidding [laughter] no\nI'm here to uh because I was at a record store I had the pleasure of being at both I'm going to explain to everybody how things went down in LA it's very ever first ever go court race and his first time ever driving a NASCAR late model stock or\nOkay okay so I had gotten involved in ... when I was about eight nine years old Eli was only two three at the time so by the time he seven he's a spoiled little brat you know my mom says\nIt was only two three at the time so by the time he seven\nHe's the spoiled little brat you know my mom says when she's mad at Eliot he was an accident and when she's happy with Eli you know he was a surprise so anyway so it is for a little brat young kid he's got to have a ... like me so we gave him a go-cart set it up\nHis first night every Saturday Night we're going to Tanner town Raceway in broad next Virginia to the ... race so we show up first night\nElites in the little junior one class the seven eight year old ... okay there's no carts there in his class at night he's the only one in his class\nMath classes the next class up is like Fifteen of of us in my class I was running what used to call the trains they stop which was older age group\nSo you know we like LA you can't raise the night bull he started crime so we make a deal so finally we say OK LA here's what we're going to\nWe're going to let you race in her ... age group but here's what we want you to do we want you to get about twenty to thirty feet by hand his class start out and just just ride and get you a race on your bail okay\nSo that's what we're going to do so we go\nWe come around we take the green flag supposedly Elliott is thirty feet behind us because he's fifty pounds lighter in a whole different class that we get the turn one and I look up to my right\nHere comes this little square [laughter]\nHe got to turn on he drove through the infield came back up on the track in front of all of us hit the guy who started beside me on the outside I flip it over my busted his caught in half broke their head or office engine and that was turned one of his first ever raised\nSo I'm thinking oh my little brother's dead air so I'd go so I'm Upset and crime you are so they're not get over there and realize he's okay so then I may so look over there and he's crying I was like what's wrong why you crying and he was crying because he had broken his engine and he was\nDone for the night he wanted to get on and and go again so his first ever raised was in the wrong class at ... speedway umbrella next Virginia and he crashed the entire trans they stopped class in in turn one

on baby step three be now what that means is that they are dead free except their home life saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three Bien means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you\nI mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about that either one not gonna be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about\nThree thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney\nYeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nIf it's something you obviously do want to do something\nYeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there I had a wonderful time not sure how great a term her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNow ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do\nYou've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six is when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that's what you're working towards\nThe middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something and slows\nDown our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume and to be able to give money\nPiled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave out ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter state ticket\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a by eighty hours or more training as I discovered this I mean there's trees highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to become a sure why NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the\nUpcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\n[noise] no I ... a a a a job are there any ... is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know with ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter show that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's a\nThat's why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than firefighters\nAnd yell believe it or not firefighters are definitely make ...\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available\nUm and you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in a regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that I think\nIt's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like I'm like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm too far into it they just\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job\nDone up to it and it was Charles not worth that much\nThere at the end of the pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I\nMean you've got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and get a counselor actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ...\nAircraft gotcha\nNot even a turbine yet but um I mean I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and he had offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get does or an ... an hour for a chill out a lot of those guys are very busy\nSo I can get into our air and our there but nothing really count as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours what does it the eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and all that kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know you might have twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much pretty much yeah and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more\nAnd so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely\nIt's a it's a passionate yeah why not I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a I I collect\nHandguns and shoot them a lot and uh and and also I burn through some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one was not going to cost you money is actually going to make you a little once you get past this but\nUp until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just gonna put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks into this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years the cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years\nOr something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that\nYou know with that much intensity uh sometimes uh unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble\nYou know without much intensity uh sometimes or an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nOf the health industry Russia [noise] interesting [noise]\nThis Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any

you tell a lot of people you're doing this are you real quiet about it\nFor the ... the first one is like I was so bad with money growing up for the first month or like a year maybe kind of kept it just with a ... and then after that my sister who's also here\nShe kind of started asking me questions to she knew I was with money going you know what are you doing it I'd give her all your books

don't care I got to the area a hundred and Thirteen thousand dollars laid off in three years making Seventy two hundred counties let Sarah does bring screw market three two one\n[noise]\nOh there is nothing like it was nothing like that we\nThink about it I think about it if you had been married three years and you know ... ...\n... took me a long time to figure this out I wasn't smart enough to figure it out as early as they did well do I wasn't either I'm fifty six\nOh no one in three years it'll be fifty nine so you might as well\nYou might as well be free you might as well make the decision when are you going to make the decision\nYou're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nWhen you spend the\nCar payment which is five hundred and six dollars over eighty four months right now according to national auto Dealers Association when you spend the average car payment\nInstead of spending it on a ... but car pay cash for your guards isn't what rich people do pay cash for your cars is with rich people do I put guys from our cars rich people no darling you will be rich people when you start paying cash for your cars maiming and drive drunk for a little while and then drove a little better job in a little better job you move up\nBut right now we're going to pay cash and instead of putting five hundred dollars towards\nThe prosperity Ford Motor credit and put it towards your prosperity and if you put five hundred and six dollars five and a four hours you put a mutual fund in your Roth IRAs got a good track record from age thirty age seven you'll have between five and six million dollars in that\nThe six dollar phone or four hours you put a mutual fund in your Roth IRAs got a good track record from age thirty to age seven to you'll have between five and six million dollars\nIn that account touchdown hope Iraq but car\nHow my problem in our coverage right out of your dollar followed our car payment does what you're driving\nAnd when we look

there\nI've been there I just didn't want to set up camp you know you got to move on to\nDo something different so when you don't have any payments when you don't have a car payment you turn yourself

I think we have a clip of it or you're a him in saying you know and and that you really handed them softball opportunity to to point out that he he's you seize this all the\nTime either property rights of the backbone of what makes us a great country and a great nation I Am a critical infrastructure expert is what I Do in a prominent defense now I attack\nThat is what I Do I think we can have it both ways I think we can protect private property rights and growing independent critical infrastructure\nWhich which actually is what the constitution and the Fifth Amendment provides for it doesn't say that the government can't build critical infrastructure just says you have to be compensated for our and ah I mean it was just I\nThe government can't build critical infrastructure just says you have to be compensated for it or and or a ... I mean it was just I thought he was\nA ... you know she kept running to the liberal safe zone of feeling versus taught a I don't think I feel I feel that uh uh this pipeline pumping station near a a a Friedman black community\nIn Buckingham is bad and of course dodging the idea that you know this Freedman black community was established\nBecause you know the Jim Crow laws wouldn't provide them opportunity to leave it in the regular you know white communities Buckingham county places like that you know things like that she just kept circling back to the uh the typical\nLeft wing talking points Hollywood elite um either ... even ... even to a great degree disconnected from the fifth district as a as a rule it seemed like she was just\nA plug and play some candidates for any district anywhere in the United states and these were going to be her talking points were did you feel the same thing optimists\nYeah absolutely and you know when you go out and search or you know what what are network and\nI mean you get everything from five hundred thousand a forty one million and um you know who she tied to I mean like you said you know this this liberal or feelings feeling just not gonna keep\nGrowing this country it is action it is it is building John\nEat out just like you know riggleman about making sure that um that in regards to our\nMobile warming or or things\nLike let's let's talk about five let's let's make sure that we're we're doing things are happening early and then the ... and so actually that make sense to make sure people don't lose their job not a feeling of my adult\nYou know and all the trophy everybody it's ridiculous\nWell and and that that the hug hug cuddle cuddle handout trophies is actually used to sue born some of the most obscene cronyism a and rent seeking in Washington I how I I wouldn't argue half if not a quarter of the streets money\nGoes through the green energy move pardon me the green energy movement in terms of\nSubsidies to this company or that company to make your solar cells or wind farms read gee he is one of the biggest companies in the history of America and and they get almost as much subsidies is some small country's GDP\nOn this like that or I go but I also wanted to make a note about out Kane is er into that and say that he's not going to pay attention to\n'em the cabin uh that that we need to worry about uh you know how people um what is in place to take care of people that have banned um um\nSexually assaulted on it and yeah it's all of it and and what I find it interesting is that\nUm you know people are realizing that you know if you vote for him Nancy plus the in that group is bound and determined to a ... vote Trump band Kavanaugh\nAnd several of them especially in the house or I forget the fellow who's the ranking Democrat on the house Judiciary Committee underneath a good laugh at the moment but he says\nUh I forget the fellow who's the ranking Democrat on the house Judiciary Committee underneath a good laugh at the moment but he said on the news MSNBC over the weekend that if he became\nThe chair of the Judiciary Committee that would be the route he would go a is investigating Kavanaugh for impeachment\nUm because it's unfortunately what our representatives have become is\nA they'd rather legislate from the bench they don't want to write a law notice how none of these you know Planned Parenthood zealots want actual legislation to codify abortion or anything like that they don't want their votes attached\nTo any sort of legislation that would make it law they'd rather let judges\nA rule from the bench and it was just really kind of evolved over the last ten years or so optimistic that this idea that we can just wait for the courts to rule on something and saves us the trouble of legislating it is just one of the branches on this\n... year almost abandonment of their responsibility I you you you watched eight years of Obama you'd governed by executive ... or the Congress hasn't passed an actual budget or since Tom Perriello was representing the fifth district\nAnd they just keep doing continuing resolution omnibus spending plans increasing you know a couple of percent on top of what they spent the last quarter are they so they won't pass a budget they don't pass any legislation\nThe last episode of the swamp\nThat documentary on Facebook which you know humility prohibits me saying which local radio show host appears\nIn the episode but at the the one of the one of the characters are what are the other congressmen says you know all we do is you don't vote to named post offices and bridges we don't do any actual work here in Congress\nOr anymore so they they want the judges they want the judiciary to legislate for them and they want the president just to sign an executive ...\nWell a gentleman you were at the end they are I Believe that they are you really need to take a look at\nIt and say that it's really a question things\nWhile he's in New York politician in the first place which which means he just comes to the place corrupt\nUh and uh it's uh but\nThat that said I mean you look at what he what he covers it to Brooklyn and western Manhattan It's the Upper West side at some of the wealthiest parts of Manhattan\nAnd the Tony Little get urban renewal section of Brooklyn around the Barclay center\nA and and I can tell you having grown up there if if you were one of the real crippling parts of New York history is the building of that Barclay center you know what was there in Brooklyn before they built the Barclay center\nOf health care came up and out of curiosity who said so you know at least your health care's free he was complaining about a weight or\nSomebody goes freedom I asked I lose fifty percent of my income in taxes and I still can't get an appointment to see a doctor\nYou know those are the empirical things that nobody or oh the conceptually\nOh you you get a bill from ... ... ... medical center for some huge amount of money for service or your insurance company bales and only pays you know sixty percent that leaves you holding the bag for the other forty percent never mind of the Veterans Administration does it do you\nUm ... it and so you're you're thinking yeah I wanted to be free I wanted to be free until you realize that it's actually not free [noise]\nIt's actually more expensive because as Jonathan Gruber pointed out you need the healthy people pay in so that you know the sick people can be given\nYour health care and then mark down as you are able to do whatever it is the government won't let them do\nLet me go do it for three four nine six for one zero seven five good morning who says\nHey Jeremy Thomas ah let me first ape and in the background Adam marker light out I'm Out there Okinawa screaming and hollering now I just want to I thought I thought\nYou were on the job site and somebody was backing a forklift ... lift\nAmong the Oklahoma or screaming at least on smaller now I just want to I\nThought I thought you were on the job site and somebody who is backing a forklift ... lift up at you but that's\nOkay [laughter] [noise] no not quite just trying to get into work safely this morning but but hey the I I actually I you said something that you know I Can't name any any right that anyone has anyone else's labor but I I actually thought of one okay um\nAnd that that is that is the freedom that it is to be an American that it was the Lakers of\nAmerica's veterans to create and maintain the freedom of the American citizen is their labor that afforded that right\nWell that they also added that but that is the only right to anyone flavor that anyone asked well\nAre you know and it's interesting because that's why I I I truly look it up a military veteran or a police officer or a firefighter as a public servant there there are ... lay are sacrificing their independence they're giving up that right to say no\nOr is this goes back when I was a kid where I grew up there was constant battles with the labor unions that ran the New York police department the New York fire department over strikes the sanitation department was striking all the time um and it was always to get more money and and do an old and we take\nA few days before the expression the blue flu comes from\nA because the laws had to be written that prohibited\nPolice officers and firefighters from striking so they would just have work slowdown\nAnd things like that and you realize that these are folks who [noise]\n... and it almost reminds you why FDR warned us about public sector unions\nBut somebody is sacrificing their independence they can't say no to you or a firefighter can't say no we're not coming to your house or a police officer can say no I'm not responding to that coal in your neighborhood and if they do they're going to face some serious charges are so they have\nActually buy their own decision sacrificed\nThat that independents like a a you use the court battles over whether a Baker should be able to bake a cake for a wedding he doesn't agree with or not or or restaurants should be able to serve you know the White House press secretary or not\nUm you know that that that independence is seeded as soon as you go into public service or in the military you're you're absolutely right about veterans but I I I look at it and the other way I Believe it's a great sacrifice or are these people have voluntarily seeded their independence in\nOrder to serve us and it's one of those reasons that you have to thank them for what they do whether it be on September eleventh or just generally when you see them in a coffee shop\nWell actually I mean and and I I Am a veteran and and I and I appreciate your viewpoint on that but it\nYou know I\nI wholeheartedly agree with you there are police officers firefighters even even in that I mean ... they can't they can't pay no like they ... they have to come to your house if if you if\nYou're in your house and you're doing drugs and you are gay and someone called nine one one they have to go right now ... years service when they hit their but half a year ago regarding list of what they call it ... let's say now\nI mean it's it's ... that to me it's a little bit ridiculous but you can't force someone to go to a hospital\nTo get treated when they know I and I have a court mandate\nYou can't force someone to go to a hospital to get treated one day no I actually have a court mandate on you that that or whatever the terminology is a ... that says yeah you're going to go\nWell it also opens up something you know I have to run up on a break here Thomas but you raise a great question because this came out of a statement the president made yesterday about stop and frisk he was down in Florida talking to a convention of law enforcement officers\nAnd uh you know with with Rod Rosenstein by the way I which I thought was a truly Trump being\nKind of thing where he's like no he's with me and and if anything just to stick it to wherever is trying to get them or to say no I flipped this guy and now he's with me or something along those lines but when he was talking to the law enforcement officers about stop and frisk\nI I had a moment to pause about it\nBecause you know what are the things that we do to our law enforcement officers on what your thought on that before I go to break is is I worry that we asked them to not come in and police crime scenes when Winfrey people do bad things\nAnd then you know investigate them punish those who do wrong and and we as a society are looking for police officers especially to be more like security guards\nAre and I think that you know if we want that we have to write a can completely different constitution in order to provide\nFor that security force that were seemingly asking the police departments to become\nYeah no I I I think you're a hundred percent right on that I mean I I got an up or you\nAlright well you drive carefully get that light fixed and we'll talk to you soon Thomas thank you my friend\nAlright daycare God Bless you for three or four nine six for one zero seven five did you hear the president's you speak in favor of stop and frisk\nI wasn't sure there was one of those moments where am I going to say I'm not necessarily down with the buggy down on the on stopping Frisbee but it is it is a debate we're having in this country is that how much we want the police to be a security squad and stop crimes before they happen isn't it nobody ... forty six\nJust walk through the doors

morning so I'm just hanging around you know now even then you have been\nPushing hard\nYou know so often you know are nonprofit community bales against the tide you've been actually you're working herculean Li an splitting the tide uh and and changing people's lives and give us an update I asked the ready to come into kind of catch up on on you really trying to turn\nOur poverty situation on its head through our faith based community and through are just your neighbor to neighbor outreach to catch us up on what's been\nGoing on well it's it's called transformation ministry in uh the object of this list to transform people and uh\nWe we still have the gap ministries we still have the clearing house we're still serve the churches and I'd love and love aimed to um look look at the back story of people in the men and try to determine what put 'em there's it through\nTheir own efforts that they end up doing stupid stuff in or is is making bad choice right you know or is it something to hit them on you know like an illness or men fired as long as they didn't\nGet fired for cause and and sometimes we make bad choices based on just an event I tried to tell my kids is\nThat um ... one of my kids turn Twenty one time right\nFeeling just the other day with your own mind our hospital but you know ... I tried to teach my kids that things are things events or events there are not good things bad things is a good thing happened to you or bad thing happen\nThings happen to you it's how you react to them it's what you do when those things happen that often establish whether it's a good thing or a bad\nYou know do you do you think God wants to see you living trap the way that you're living there is there is another way and if you just uh uh put in the time and the effort or will walk with you and we'll give you some of the help that you need to get you over the home\nYou know why would God wants you to be in the straight exactly right so you you said you have twenty families\nWell what is it started off the first one we did was was six folks the second session was about five or six go we wanted to keep them small in the beginning and now we're on our fourth session we started in twenty Seventeen\nUm we're now on or the fourth session of affirming you your potential\nUm but with a farming is the first one is the first step always and then we add to that budget counseling and boundaries and then listening for heaven's sakes no ... and we we got a U.S section that is really humorous is uh\nAnd then listening for heaven's sakes oh yeah and we we got a U.S section that is really humorous is ah about your stinking thinking [laughter]\n\nYou got to change your thinking thinking yeah and I wish I could remember all the bugs because they they they they have a ... a different bugs for all these things that we we get our mindset into yeah that that self defeating you know a narrative that we ... ourselves and um but what\nHappens is it bolsters folks and they\nThey they come to realize that to somebody else in the rooms got the same problem I've gotten or someone else in the room solve their problem this way I can do that too and uh now that's the affirming pie that's the the client or the neighboring need part we call them neighbors and need announced at a client but\nThe the the part that makes it work\nIs a book called redemptive compassion which is six case studies actual case studies are of um people out in Idaho and loving and people that want to mentor other folks because it takes mentoring to also helped walk with these folks\nShort short because they didn't get there by you know just ...\nAnd so people that take the um a from a revamped of compassion they then become mentors\nOr if they don't become mentors at least they understand the strategy and the philosophy of loving and how we approach people in the ... and so they can go back to their churches and where you have people come into the church for for help then they can step and said just the way it's supposed to be handled\nRight into it it becomes branch off it was but what\nIs really neat is we always start off with a supper you know just sort of break the ... the mood whatever and the neat thing about it is when they go in and they start off\nNobody knows well the the ... but the the neighbors and need to have no clue who's a neighbor and who's a mentor\nRight right it's not all this one's wearing a uniform not above you and I'm not you know blah blah blah we've all we may be in different places on that pass by but here's my elbow\nAnd lock arms and walk together and it's a what happened what was really neat is the mentors themselves are saying they're transformed so it's not just transforming the neighbors in actually transforms the mentors to who are\nWho are already should have already been in a in a place do you think all righty but now they they find their own\nRejuvenation from how can we help how can you know somebody listening right now do you need a oh you know help or what can we do to to help maybe introduce people to the program or do you need more an average ... well\n... all the above we we need people that were dying to take the redemptive compassion that's a six week is just six weeks in um six Monday nights basically um but but you come out of that understanding how to really help people\nAnd so for so long our churches have just handed stuff out blindly say oh we will now we've got to help them because they can't help themselves that's malarkey and uh and we're finding more and more churches that are now saying wait a minute you know all we're doing the same same face in rotation right there's got to be a better way\nEnd up their churches are seeing that can you imagine what a great bureaucracy with a different person I mean I'm Talking about a faith group you know a church where it's the minister it's the deacon then we know each other it's a small community organization the gray bureaucracy that's a shrine\nGroup you know a church where the minister it's the deacon and we know each other it's a small community organization the gray bureaucracy that's ... that's going on there that this is how we break this\nExactly now we still have our gang ministries you know we have the laundromat for folks who can't afford to do the laundry we've got the children's clothing store we got the personal care ... we've got a\nA horrors that we ... we'll give away as they as they come in so I mean there's a lot of avenues that we can still help folks financially and as we do that we tell them on the money you saved here be sure you use that for your rent your utilities ... you know don't come back to the

or a radio host I rented a house or shower remain nameless\nAnd call me out for it if you'd like to be their job I don't think I've ever said that but uh uh\nI think I heard it the other day and and and a couple of months or maybe a couple of weeks prior to that and and I always wanted to tell people\nTo converse right and you know are having conversations they don't cover state I mean sometimes it I don't know what I hear that my\nMy wife knows that sometimes I I intentionally you ever met you remember the old comedian a norm Crosby\nYes it where does Malala props were intentional\nYeah and I will I Will\nClaim sometimes that happens I'm not sure if those were the times 'cause I don't remember the the conversation\nAs well and it's not as serious as\nWell and that's my problem too I got a smile more often let's put a smile on that face but I appreciate you have a great more to exert a anything problems he a big enough to take the hits myself\nAbout taking bragging online service so you you jumped into after our discussion about stop and frisk what's on your mind\nJust real quick\nOcean about stop and frisk what's on your mind\nYeah just a couple of things that are real quick one is you got to get a\nCredit is the master of you know that about a for us but not doing anything about it because that creates the automatic a political thing where he goes tell everybody or staying up your right even though he does but I think\nIt's right said he doesn't do anything for it or you know and I I pointed out to him at one point there's this wonderful part at the end of every city council meeting where counselors or allowed to bring up resolutions\nThat aren't on the agenda they may not get voted on but they can be voted to be put on the next agenda and I haven't heard was springing up once and three years well\nYou can't do that he would ... the ability to have the\nPolitic about that right I just wanted to match that you know like you I don't agree with President Trump everything and just remind people at some of the strongest supporters of stop and frisk where Stalin and Hitler\nOh absolutely and and here's the thing you know the the problem is I think that as a society we like to protect our stuff ... except for the open borders people who liked to protect their stuff not everyone else's um\nBut the ... the the debate should be do you want a security force or do you want a police force do you want a constitutional policing or do you want security and and that is a debate you\nCan have Israel is one of those places I remember listening to my left wing friends complaining about this the checkpoints on August twelfth on the downtown mall I said have you been to Tel Aviv\n... you know this is this is just going to the market uh where you've got to stop and go through in the coming in this neighborhood and they got to check your car and things like that that's security versus policing and I kind of kind of reminds me of what John Adams warned us not the uh\nThe attorney general candidate in Virginia but his great great great great great uncle when he warned us that the constitution was only going to work if we were a moral society and then in and I think that that over the last at least fifty years we've unhinged ourselves from that morality\nBecause you know for whatever reason the people bristled that you're telling them how to live if you say now shall not murder or now shall not steal thou shalt not bear false witness against somebody and and people take offense and say you can't tell me what to do\nIt you know there are some truism you shouldn't steal from people you shouldn't lie about them you shouldn't bear falls witness you that the ... to certainly shouldn't murder um you know why are these time honored simplicity ... too complex for us Bob\nUh I agree and and and it's you know when you are as that famous ... says when you're looking for safety and security and you get her\nTo through it it has a lead through\nWhere you have to be careful I mean and that's one thing if ... first when very specified guidelines but you're right it can punch the police for heroin efficient economic guarantee whatever choice they make everything gets reviewed in a car and you'll be wrong\nIt and is Jim pointed out and even before that I pointed out ironically this was on his way to swearing the guy that was just the victim of you know guilty until proven innocent um and a ... and I I at least I Will say this\nThe president this current president seems more likely if Jeff Sessions or Rod Rosenstein was to pull him aside and say or Ted Cruz was to pull him aside and point out all the ...\nAnd it seems more likely if Jeff Sessions or Rod Rosenstein was to pull him aside and say or Ted Cruz was to pull him aside and point out all the problems with what he was talking about\nA new one to the very least and clarify what he was talking about but a a ... as opposed to other presidents who seem you know their dog ... was you know more for firmly put together than their karma\nYeah certainly I think that unique ability of changing his mind yeah which is not a bad thing given evidence for change\nRight

I I think that's almost certainly a big factor whether that's the entirety of it I don't know but the truth of the matter is\nThere is something else that we're aware of and that is that I Believe she was governor of the state of South Carolina for six years before that that has you know at a at a time being away and the stresses and so on so I I think that\nThese are factors for anybody um and whether that's the entire time\nSo that's the entirety of it I just don't know but uh we don't have any other public explanation at least at this point\nI Know that there were people who are raising questions about the way the president did it because he said I'm I'm holding an event it will be at the White House I have some big news to announce about my great friend Nikki Haley\nI thought it was a classy way to give us send off to a really valuable former employee which may be every boss in America should take a lesson from that uh and and I would imagine that I Hope the president can get somebody almost as good as her to replace her\nBut that may be tough these days with the uh the the left in the never Trump or is making it making a job in the Trump Administration look as an unattractive as they possibly can make it look\n[noise] well that's for sure of one of the names that is being rooted about I have to say I'm I'm very apprehensive about and that is a a woman who formally was a H R McMaster's deputy at the national Security Council a moment by the name of dino Habib Powell\nAnd um she may or may not have an easy time in the Senate I don't know but\nUm you know one of the things that many of us are the buyer hugely about a decade Haley of course has been um the absolutely\nForthright and tenacious and well even courageous championing of American interests in\nThe United nations specifically in the middle east and most especially with respect to Israel\nAnd unfortunately in my experience Dina it'd be Powell is not\nThe Nikki Haley on any of those things and those are of course the president's policies so you'd expect her to chat with them but um she has been in again my experience I'm very much susceptible to the uh\nThe blender Smith shall we say of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United states she hails from Egypt originally and I think this would be a terrible mistake so I Hope that's not the president's going to wind up but uh you're right Lars or anybody is going to face or the gauntlet\nUh unless this is this going to come up presumably after a deal on the election and I'm perhaps the Democrats will be chastened a let's hope so\nWell tell me this one of the things I fail to understand Frank is when someone takes a job\nWorking for someone or some thing either an end to be a business and to to Europe ... political entity\nA and says I really don't subscribe to the beliefs of this entity the policies are the charter of this group\nOr I don't know I'm going to work for a person and I don't agree with him but I'll take the job and then I'll deliberately and we've seen this happen in the Trump Administration a bunch of times in the last two years just say I'm going to take the job and then I'm going to do whatever the heck I Want to do with the job no matter what the boss things\nWhy do people do that and why did they get away with it\n[noise]\nThink they do it because um they often have the hubris or to think that they know better than the president said appointed to that position or they often uh or even contemptuous\nOf the person who gave them a job and the question is as you say how do they get away with it um and unfortunately in the first year of the Trump Administration there was altogether too much of that\nUh I think probably at least in part because of the president was you know spending most of it\nThey'll spending most of his ... waking hours trying to contend with the various um a investigations allegations and uh and other personnel challenges occasional crisis or to end up as a result\nYou know folks who should have been called\nTo account words and it only\nIncentivize them to do more and frankly it serves as an example for others to do the same so\nThat's a problem and I think it's gotten considerably better my sense of it at least as a with my palm pilot state and John Bolton that the national Security Council or at least in those parts of the of the national security arena\nThe that's the thing I've wondered about because frankly honestly there are some groups in the ACLU called me up and said well pay a pile of money to come down and be our press spokesman for the ACLU I'd say thank you very much know\nImmediately know I I don't fit I I Believe in civil liberties I don't believe in the way that they're doing it on the other hand there might be individuals that I Would say yes to quickly or no to quickly\nBut I Can't imagine going to work and promising to take a pay check\nTo do a job intending to not do the job because I think and and intending if anything to undercut\nThe you know the the beliefs in the philosophy the person I'm going to work for unless I sat down with him and said yeah I'll go to work for you but I Believe the way you been doing things is wrong\nAnd you can do much better if you do it my way and if your employer your prospective employers is why you're probably right we'll let you change the way we're doing things then you might take the job but\nDeciding to deliberately torpedo your employers to satisfy some other goal I I just do not under the I Can't wrap my head around and Frank\n... well ... and this is why you know unfortunately we have a lot of swamp creatures and very few Lars Larson [laughter] so we could we could use a lot more of you here I can tell you that\nAnd again it it I called it the phenomenon of the in subordinate subordinates um during President Trump's first year in office\nOr H R McMaster as I mentioned Dina pals old boss of was a prime example of this and and you know I think was talking about this before but just right off\nThe day he joined the national Security Council\nHe announced his staff that he did not approve of the use of the term radical Islamic terrorists\nWhich you may remember was something the president actually said repeatedly and come pain for office\nOn as a platform of what was going to be different about his administration from Obama's it it was just one early indication that he was a bad choice and a mistake and I'm so grateful that he's gone and uh so appreciative that John Bolton was selected as has replaced but go ahead who has a lot lately either\nI think Ambassador Bolton is the best and frankly\nFrank I'm Talking to Frank ... from the center for security policy\nI think it'd be the height of dishonesty to walk in and tell an employer\nI'm going to go to work for you and not say by the way ms president your entirely wrong about radical Islamic terrorism and I plan to say so\nAnd and if you still want to hire me then go ahead and hire me but hire me knowing that that's true in my example of that Frank I don't have a college degree and I'm told every employer whoever thought about hiring me by the way you know I Do not have a ... I've got a year and a half in college run out of college degree\nI'm planning that you're going to die soon uh it'd be tough to negotiate with somebody like that shouldn't we push back against that kind of thing and even be a little bit belligerent since all the you know warm fuzzy talk of the last Thirty years hasn't really brought the Palestinians anywhere even when Arafat was offered a of a Ninety eight percent of what he wanted he said no\nHe wants the Jews are dead and we'd like\nTo I think it's a little bit more like a if your neighbor if you were living in your neighbor's backyard effects are going to give it back and then she do despite it being U.S foreign policy that you ought to uh so uh the Palestinians are far from perfect\nUh and I agree with you it Arafat ah made a mistake in those negotiations but uh I think it's the Netanyahu\nGovernment that has refused because she ate now are not Palestinians are and is that the is a real obstacle to peace there but I mean that that issue\nOr is it a hardly the most important one little or evaluating Haley I think ah her her policies are statements on North Korea Syria which really seems to want us to try to overthrow of Assad\nUh which I think would bring a a messy chaos tried it\nAnd Iran are or where the biggest problems where\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war\nAs I recall bronco bomber ran as the anti war president and he ended up putting troops into Syria without telling the public for a long long time ended up putting troops a number of places you didn't get that while he got them all the way out of Iraq and then ended up putting about six or eight thousand back into Iraq because pulling out\nPulling out a while you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did and then we ended up having to put troops ride back in there and and yet the constant drumbeat I heard before Trump was elected and after he was like does this guy's going to get us into a war\nIt seems to me that the previous president Brock Obama got us into more conflict or put people in harm's way and more conflicts\nThan this president has and this president is actually figured out how to get North Korea at least come to the table and he's and he's taking a hard line with the Iranians which one is the more pro war President Trump or Obama\nWell I I'm not sure I I certainly wouldn't growth or almost all the all the stuff that Obama date I Wish\nObama hadn't a continued a lot of the war the inherited her bed at the war in Afghanistan or\nGot more deeply involved in Syria or helped overthrow the government of Libya I opposed all those things that thought they were mistakes are I think uh the Trump Administration has continued almost every ah well they actually if you could every war they inherited a and I think they deserve some credit for for\nPursuing diplomacy with North Korea or by uh the bend a across the board I think a fairly illiterate but the main thing is that you know we we have a bipartisan consensus in this country a left and right as much as they are throw rocks at each other and decker tend to agree and all these things but I just said\nDemonstrates that so I disagree with both sides and both parties president when they are advocate wars that I think are needless\nDo you think that sometimes talking in a bit of belligerent tone to people who've decided to be problematic in one way or another is sometimes the best way to keep them from going too far rather than try to you know the nice warm fuzzy approach to them because that never seems to work\nWell we we do try that nice warm fuzzy approach a at time certainly uh the Trump Administration does the certain countries a Saudi Arabia for example are that are problematic\nUh I think a third\nOf course there are times people ... threatening ah but I the the example that I mentioned doesn't bats are Haley doing it I thought were mistaken\nA week she threatened for example uh she said it was U.S policy that we were bombed the north Koreans if they had an ICBM then they test an ICBM that we can bomb them so I think you know if you're going to make threats they should be ones that you're prepared to act on in that case it was freelancing and not a\nFollow any sort of broader policy that have been articulated and I think that that sort of empty plaster is is bad for us credibility and our reputation\nActually agree with you there as for the Israelis living in the backyard of the Palestinians professor one last thing in the last forty seconds when countries go to war on this planet isn't it generally the case that when the the boundaries or ... when the hostility sees that they stay where they are until the two sides strike a peace correct\n[noise] for okay I'll like North Korea and South Korea we don't actually have an end of that war so we have this DMZ down in the middle and\nAnd that's where it stays until you strike a peace the Israelis that people have made war on the Israelis and they took property or in those conflicts and they hang onto it until somebody who's willing to strike a peace which they could do anytime they want\nAnd which they have vastly resisted being willing to do that kind of thing professor Friedman I've always appreciate your insight even when we don't agree on saying thank you very much

swamp and what we're doing is exposing the swap and expose the hypocrisy on them out\nSo yeah we're going into these districts and talk with women and men that like the Maxine Waters who say we have to impeach forty five now when we go with her district we see the\nHomelessness and people in poverty while she's living in a fair point three million dollar mansions on a one hundred and Seventy four thousand dollar salary they get it gave you the truth the truth\nWe come back we're not hold anything back that\nOld dumb encouraged and by the way it premieres on the fifteenth of October so coming right up and I take it you timed it very nicely for the election\nI don't know if they're looking for but I felt the need that when they all came forth particularly been featured in the movie I thought that needed time with the American people to speak out on that show the hypocrisy these people walk by us we paid them tax dollars to look at the American people\nCalled them out on that stuff we get to criticize them because we pay them\nThat is right to make sure you got the Democrats the movie dot com that's dummy craft the movie dot com to get your ticket one night premier October to Fifteen we want to see your face and the play\nAC DC Maryland area you wanna join diamond the silk that night and being with us at night to view it you can go to a diamond is a dot com pick on democratically going to be paid for an event and get your take is right there for that\nHaving been in the presence of these two wonderful lady's I Know what it's like and it's you got to be on your game you got to be paying attention because otherwise you're gonna miss half of what they say because they need comes out so fast it's like standing under a wonderful wonderful conservative point of view\n[laughter] I Love how you know that's an end but now when you have a pass if the country are you love your country and when you say left leaning liberals try to destroy the country\nTrying to push the movement for that America could no longer exist the way we know we have to stop this foolishness we're not gonna know we're not going to have a country\nAnd so that's why we just about what we talk about\nI'm Talking to a dime and so the Internet and sanctions and I was just sharing with my audience this outrageous statement by Hillary Clinton who I guess things she's still a player or by coming out and saying we can't have civility\nUntil you give us power back so and I thought you're really going to keep up with these protests and the funny knit hats and pounding on doors and yelling at people and threatening people in restaurants and in public places until we give you power back that it hasn't seemed like the right way to get\nIt like a dictator that may be like a day in order to dominate you know let's go back to the Democrat Party [laughter] quote they now they want to please them all the press and they thrive as surprised people just look at it\nI Want everybody you know I don't even care what side of the hour on if you like to be a box\nThat can be up our country that doubling respect that make it people guilty and they got to figure out how to pull them up in the I'm trying to dismantle the constitution one to wait wait it when they need to wait it you know like that you need to get out you need to wait and you need both Republican and they are\nAnd also look at what happened whenever the Democrat did have power they had it for eight years and what did they do for this country\nHide deficit unemployment rate it it was out of the the window they send jobs overseas and look at what they actually did for this country when they did have power but we want that again\nAnd Obama when he had and\nHe thought that at all almost all packed you on the air out of coping as well and I had to work for the latest how would he looked up at how the puppet master string ... okay to cap it\nYou know what I Love about the president holding a Hollywood actor heath by the American people and that could lead to working for\nMom tell you what maybe a Hollywood good way I Love the fact that you've done it and participate in this documentary 'cause I think I've loved documentaries forever I used to make them for TV stations and you know none of mine have been as successful as I Know dummy crowds was going to be\nBut I thought it was a great way of getting a point across if you get people with a ten second attention span to sit down and watch it\nI Believe that it's not people laugh is saying they were telling people to pay attention as we've been we've been banned book about the less\nThey claim that they want this is that the Americans want if you're truly what this is Seth America's\nWhy didn't you come to the table for tax cuts were Americans would have been successfully any more money in their pockets why did you come to the table and things we want to be said to the table we want to take in fact\nThat they somebody you see I'm Out in the street all the people out there and the strength you know back\nIn the day with the KKK what why now you got and people with black math and I think if you don't like what's happening you know you had the gambling died organize and go to the polls and vote away at the white folk we probably can't\nLadies it is always a pleasure You're welcome back on my program anytime thank you so much thank you for having us\nDiamond instilled the Internet's in stations now featured in the new movie called dummy crowds by the way I Want to tell you about something\nLet that go um I Need a great night sleep well last couple of nights I haven't had a great nicely because I've been on the road came up to Seattle heading back home tonight back to our home studios\nHow about a great bed next month November\nTina nine march Twenty years in sleeping honestly number but\nHow does a great night sleep improve your performance how 'bout more energy less brain far better mood more productivity the new sleeve number three sixty smart but the one I'm going home to denied helps everyone from parents to pro athletes improve their daily performance through the proven quality sleep it delivers\nMy sleeve number setting sixty five Gina's thirty five forty forty five where you can adjust each side and so many couples disagree on mattress from his sleeve number beds what you adjust all that and the beds are so smart they sent your every move and they automatically adjusts to you that keeps you sleeping\nRoughly a hundred and fifty of those a year all over the country we do some online these are big corporations are that are looking to recruit the highest level of talent you know from the veteran pool so they do recognize that they also recognize the value\nOf disabled veterans and what they also bring to the workforce so I think it's out there\nUh but we do struggle with the fact that the unemployed as unemployment goes down and and everybody's thrilled about where the rate is right now and that's great were behind that one hundred percent but the overwhelming majority of those that we deal with on a direct bases\nAre are not unemployed underemployed and in some cases over employed\nJeff here's the thing we hear about discrimination in the workplace all the time\nAnd yet this is one of the few places were an employer could correct me if I'm wrong literally discriminate in favor an employer well I think Wal Mart did does not long ago said we're going to hire ten thousand votes and if they were effectively saying everyone else yeah we're going to hire them first that the law allows them to do that\nThey'll say we're going to hire vets were going to give preference to vets I Know there are a lot of government jobs that give preference to vets and then you take into account the fact that a veteran of the who's done service is likely in some cases more finished the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman\nAnd then if you factor in the Americans with Disabilities Act that says you legally have to accommodate people's disabilities you think that the veteran would be in the cat bird seed for getting jobs that are available that they want to pursue the careers they want to do am I missing something or because you said that the surveys show that\nNot quite two thirds more certainly more than half of all veterans are worried that when they go out and uh\nSaid that when they go out in the workplace of their disabled they're going to face discrimination I Would hope they see not only employers saying we will follow the ADA and accommodate your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant\nIs that not happening uh I\nI think what you know with a statistic that that comes from a survey that we had you know that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans\nYou know fear discrimination in other words um they understand the position that they're in a ... but when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join a police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability\nOr because I think a lot of it really comes from the stigma that\nYou know you don't do that over the years that was taboo to do that you kind of keep that thing to yourself um where in fact I Believe where we are today in society is exactly as you put it companies are seeking those individuals again because of the fact that they have no disability um\nYou know one of the things that that we particularly when we started interacting with companies on a regular daily basis [noise]\nEspecially the multitude of them at career fairs is the fact that there was so much\nAnd and still so much work to do on the education front of educating employers on what a disability is\nHowever to the point the the companies are doing everything they can and creating a really really great opportunities for veterans now we've got to get the veterans to understand that hey\nYou need to disclose that went into proper to disclose it\nUh companies want to hire you because of it because there are tax incentives for them financial incentives for them to hire you\nAnd it just trying to get both of them and bridge that gap that's where that you know our our ... guide to hiring and retaining veterans with a disability is is really that we've released this month is hopefully going to help on both sides of the table with that\nSo Jeff working folks find these resources on line and and I would encourage people if you've got a veteran and your family or your circle of friends go out and say hey if you looked at this thing especially if you know somebody who isn't already on his dream her ... his dream job or her dream jobs they have you looked at this this can help you get where you want to go\nSure ah\nSo I'll I'll divide that into a boat or the same
