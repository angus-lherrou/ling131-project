S. M. C. A. that includes both Canada and Mexico\nHas this way of approaching trade deals by saying we will use tariffs if we have to to get our trade partners back to the table and negotiate a better deal for America has this worked out the way Donald Trump said it was going to work out\nQuite I have to have the you know like is it there's no doubt that they're just\nOh that there's a big relief uh from investors and the market and uh and everyone honestly about the agreement that was a there was an ounce a late last night but that is because it took us off the brink of an edge that was created by the chaos\nA of Mrs Trump so the one overwhelming benefit is that now we have a deal but the only reason why we were um maybe not having a deal is because I'm Mr Trump said he was going to withdraw us\nFor a lower terrorists learn really not getting any of this because the metal terrorists are still on in me that the retaliatory Therese from Mexico and Canada are still on and honestly the concessions that Canada did on very\nUm they're they're pretty minor I think we have to remember what if we're talking about terrorists the the\nWe have to remember what we had under NAFTA under NAFTA owe us exports will go into Mexico duty free\nAll non ag exports\nFrom by the U.S we're going to Canada\nDuty free and Ninety seven percent of the value of I exports was going to Canada duty free and so yes there were those stubborn like dairy dairy ah I'm I'm\nA Paris and they were or they were about that they will mostly bad for Canadian consumers\nFor some of our industries dairy for example you mentioned we got construction from Canada would we been able to get those any other way\nYes that is so you're you're saying like basic say yes for a dairy producer let's not forget we have a massive trade a surplus when it comes to dairy was Canada so they were already you know a\nFarmer's American farmers are doing really great under NAFTA and uh and and but so a few dairy farmers will be able to have more access to the to the to the market a market that they had fair a fairly good access to\nIn the past but Canadian consumers\nAre going to be ripping off really the benefits because the prices for them is going down\nQuite you know quite importantly\nCharge their prices will go down but more American farmers will be able to sell their products in the ... we heard famously about the two hundred and Seventy ... they were being charge on American goods that meant that\nThe American farmer who's costs are probably relatively the same as a Canadian farmer stone cows he's going to have for equipment and buildings but he's got to feed the cows that did whose products are to be sold it may be one for the cost in Canada to be able to compete with the locally produced milk cheese butter all the rest of that and\nAnd yet we had we had a massive trade surplus and dairy with Canada\nAnd then we ... we shouldn't be getting the impression that because\nI could tumors in Canada or have to we're going to have to pay a really much higher price um than uh because of the terrorists than they would otherwise they weren't buying a ton of dairy\nFrom from from the U.S they were and it's and it's because you know the the way\nThe Canadians suddenly the work\nIs very different than ours it's like it's it's a lot of quotas on how much that can produce so\nMuch higher prices and things like this so um it's it it's a different system and that's one where he spite of the the import tax imposed by Canada Canadian it was still in their interest to buy a lot of dairies from the U.S that said\nHe's from the U.S that said I think it's a very good thing it's a good thing for the farmers will sell more it's a great thing for Canadian consumers but it's also worth putting it in perspective that terrorists are all were not an issue\nWith NAFTA because most terrorists were zero most exports ah with this one example where we're actually at zero if their problem was trade barriers they're mostly find found in regulation than other things and and I don't know that we're getting a good deal on auto\nBecause um it's going to lead to higher prices of automobile now\nYou know if you think that um to maybe some of the small benefits to union\nWorkers is is a good thing and then you'll think it's a good thing if you're a consumer of cars in the U.S it's it's not a good thing but again it could have been much worse and and and and it's a deal\nThat people will learn to live with I don't think we should expect expect expect massive changes in employment I don't think we should make it a expect massive jobs to come back to the U.S because a lot of the lost his job and manufacturing started in Nineteen fifty is due to automation but\nIt's better to have a deal than not do you have a deal and it could have been much worse\nWell let me ask you about some of the subjects I watch the president this morning talking about the deal and I've I've done some other research on what because we don't\nI mean some of the particulars we don't have publicly yet but they said that more car and truck porch will be made in North America and that that is a boost from the old NAFTA and forty percent of the work on a car or truck we'll have to be done by workers making at least sixteen dollars an hour and they said and obviously this\nAny trade deal has to be a winner not just for people buying and selling things were making drinks but also for people who are employed in the manufacture things\nIf there's a minimum requirement that forty percent of the part to the work on a car has to be done by people at sixteen bucks an hour that is for the most part Canadian or American workers and probably not Mexican or Asian workers' rights\nThat that is true but it doesn't mean that actually they will that the supply that first let's let's first say that\nUm it's not as if we're going from a system where they will no requirement to a system that now has all these requirements on neighbor or certainly it is but I'm actually quite surprised but you actually find that\nA good to impose increasing the court costs of labor\nBecause if the Democrats were asking for an increase the minimum wage to sixteen percent you will understand that this is a great distortion to the American labor market and it's not a good thing but now let's let's just say that that are under the deal as written especially\nConsidering the protection for a Canadian and Mexican from potential ... in the future it is very possible that this these requirement of a of a higher wages and also of a more sourcing\nIn Canada Mexico and um\nAnd and the U.S of auto parts will just means that automakers are going to knock change their supply chain but instead we'll decide to face the two point five percent terrorists\nThat the U.S has in place is going to demand they depend on their\nOn their on their own you know business model right and there's not going to be a one size fit all but it is the assuming that everyone will change their supply chain and I think is is wrong I'm and I um and I definitely don't think that it's necessarily\nYear but um we we have continued to move on we we go to country music outdoor festival all year long we continued to do it we've been back to Vegas we we're not going to stop living\nBut it's still the ...\nOh it's your store suffer

S. B. and Atlanta who called turned six seven and eight today and as always by Alexis Ericson and guys this is easily the most\nAnticipated race of the season I think maybe even more than the Daytona five hundred because of the unknown value a broad stroke picture Alexis thoughts and your take on what happened\nToday in the world yeah you know this is something we've been talking about on this show particularly and and every other NASCAR show there is for some time now and I really think honestly it lived up to the hype\nAh the the first half of the first couple of stages of the race today we're kind of slow in payment I think drivers were were kind of feeling things out and and seeing where they were and then once we got\nDown to money time you know we had that late rice costs and that's really what changed everything it was setting up to be a fuel mileage a race which has its own ... drama and and would have been fantastic to see but\nUh you know when we had that late race cautioned that really changed everything with Brad Keselowski going in a you know getting the brakes heart into turn one crash in the field and and really shaken things up and I just think that drama today was was fantastic\nEven without the wrecks at the end that really budget everything up\nSeeing just constant action all over the track and even as we were having the calls is the lead with space out there was always something going on seven or sixteenth place even\nAnd then as the race played out later brought before all of a cautious we're wondering Alex ... Boyer Ryan blading wherever they're going to be there sitting there floundering Mitt pack All right next to the points it right next to each other on the track I don't think you could have written a better script there and then to see the finish my gosh the sea Jimmy Johnson make a really a rare Jimmy Johnson mistake\nThat that's something that that will go down to the animals and not only showed motor speedway asteroid but also NASCAR history\nAnd it's funny because yesterday mark arrow reminded me goes Doug is this is going to be different because of the sugar cane at the end the race is not over to the drivers ... again and I was thinking about that\nIs Jimmy Johnson is battling with with true acts and of course Jimmy wants to win the race at that point he's pure race or he's thinking I Want the checkered black I Want to break this losing streak and he's not thinking about the ramifications that ultimately take him out of the playoff chase election well if you think\nAbout it it's been a really long time since Jimmy Johnson has been in a position to be that close to the checkered flag you know on the final lap of the race and I think you know a lot of fans will probably say oh well you know if he would've just played it a little cool then he you know he'd still be in the ... in the playoffs he be going into the to the next round\nBut Jimmy Johnson on the last lap going into you know the last turns to sugar cane he's thinking about I haven't won in a really long time\nI Need to win this race for my for my fans and for my crew and for my team and you know even said he he made a mistake but he he he went all in and I can't really fault him for that\nIs it a tie breaker or understand is correct yeah Eric I'm rolling Kyle Larson and then their best finishes in around this first round of the playoffs what determined that tie break right Kyle Larson on the flipside of that\nGets to take it out and direct the brag because lousy ... Bush and everybody got wanted up in and the Houston there were the wounded ... race car manages to pass jeopardy Earnhardt come to the starfish led to pull into that tie and think about this with the entire regular season\nWithout Jimmy Johnson scoring any play all points if he wins one stage than the regular season we're not having this conversation it's actually the jar on a finished eighth and he gets in\nWell stage regime change the way you play the game now and I think everybody knows that you have to play attention you have to pay attention to those playoffs which is what a lead the Martin George junior having such a dominant year last year I've got to give German Johnson credit I think you're right a Lexus thing he forgot about the playoff implications\nI Want to win a race been fifty one races since I got a checkered flag on the seven time champion I'm going to go for it and I thought he may end up at the end of it and the you know\nHe owned getting into ... and you know through ex was upset but\nYou know for true exercise benefit he's already moving on he he knows he's going to be a playoff driver moving forward and for Jimmy Johnson was good to see him in the hunt all day this wasn't a fluke thing Doug that he was battling toward the end of the ...\nIt certainly was an early in this race weekend our announcer who is in terms of getting his return whatever they were nine and ten Rob Albright\nSaid that he thought this was the Jimmy Johnson tied to brace and even when Johnson shifted back of the pack after pit stops he managed to always make up the difference on those new tires again pin spots over a run it really seemed like even if he just finished third bit it was going to be there\nYeah I mean even even when we talk to him in Las Vegas that media day you know Doug asked him about the role of oil and and and what his thoughts were going into it and he really had this re circled as one that he thought was such a wild card that he could get a good finish and he can make some some things that you know I\nThink there may be some ... fans out there that that would be a little bit upset with what happened at the end of the race but I Do want to say Jimmy did get on Twitter afterwards and he tweeted everyone makes mistakes apologies to the Seventy eight and all of their fans I don't think it would have mattered who was leading the race at that time\nJimmy solve the possibility of getting a checkered flag and and like I said he went all and it just didn't work out\nAnd we should hear from him later on after he does who's Towson the speedway club the race one or that we're really not talked about the Ryan plan what\nTo do for Ryan Blaine\nEverything it does everything for ... move them you know into the next round um it it gives him the possibility at a championship\nOr and it gives him a ... when ... bank of America row before I ... this race is going to go down in the history books as one of the biggest uh in this era of NASCAR and and he\nAnd and he will forever be the winner of this right and in such traumatic bashing if somebody will coin a phrase for for how you know what you mentioned one hot night on the broadcast there's going to be something that gets going and we'll be talking about this race on their show for years and years to come\nWhat one key to winning a championship or being in contention is overcoming adversity before the ... which is the second last one\nBlaming was in that gaggle they're running about twenty something then you had the cars could take it out in the rec\nThan the cars the pigs they had nothing to lose it suddenly blaming you boom and the boy you're up there in the top five or top ten and then he just has to pass one or two cars he just Jamie mcnairy on the restart their and he said he could bribe position when the two leaders wrecked to just come out of nowhere in a car that had to get rebuilt this weekend by the way to win on the road course which you'd never tag lady for\nTo win the championship a lot of times you have to be really good but sometimes you also have to have good luck yeah he had a lot of good luck today that's luck that law an\nAdjunct John Martin tricks junior take each other out and they're spinning and slow motion and Ryan just literally drives between the two cars that goes on to win the race it isn't that how ...\nPetty won his first raised the Richmond and eighty six\nFive cars had direct in front of ... [laughter] avail us about that Adam and I do not a dramatic finish I ran blaming stock goes up just a second when he's an enormously popular driver because he's so adept at social media and you can gauge the fans well so I don't\nThink this does anything but really really helped his stock as far as a cat opposing him up and popularity\nComing up on our next segment by the way to show is brought to you by Toyota you can find out more Toyota Racing dot com and Toyota did not win this one today it ran to the blue oval and afford for Ryan Delaney\nComing up in our next segment we're going to talk to two other folks that helped call the action today from the Indianapolis motor speedway radio network mark James and Mickey oh been joined us on this special edition of fast talk\nChris rockets straight from the NASCAR stance here's another member of our Toyota Racing family Jason Hi there oh you seem impatient oh well I've been holding it in for a while for a while since it started the race no the season wow 'cause you don't want them is actually\nYou know from that perspective it was interesting but as successful season we're excited about the schedule changes next year or go into ... which is a fabulous facility there in in Texas and uh\nUh you know we we we are excited about going to be doing a sick as well and uh we we we continue to do besides that schedule a little bit and to continue to be excited about the ... embarking on another season\nI don't dare to put words in Marcus missed mouth I don't know that this has been discussed but there's a really good track here in Charlotte motor speedway that Indy Car could I think\nExcel on racing on the role that we're in bed and were sold medicine that Congress should mark and I have already had asked on how well she's really where this weekend I I'd love to see Indy Car to get back to this marketing you know what let's let's put the whole gang back together and cone IndyCar race right\nThat'd be awesome guys thanks so much for being a part of this was a lot of fun I I got chill bumps up in the booth today during the introductions as everybody introduce themselves because it was a hybrid team of I.

B.\n[noise]\nThe citizen to fast stock being recorded shortly after the bank\nOf America for a hundred ... here in Charlotte motor speedway I'm Doug rice joined by a Lexus Ericson and from W. S. B. in Atlanta and he called the action it turns six seven and eight today Doug Turnbull not only was this and a nod girl event\nWith wind Laney winning the race this was also a cut off race for the playoffs for drivers will not be battling for a championship\nOr watch yeah huge playoffs implications this race had a leaving here today Jimmy Johnson Austin dealing Denny Hamlin an air Jones are all out of the playoff chances they no longer have a shot at the championship\n... if you look at those four I think probably the biggest surprise to me is Denny Hamlin um you know he he struggled some this year but I thought he showed more speed to get out of the top you know to get out of at least the first round and and that didn't happen um there was a a a three way tie and you were talking about that a little bit earlier does\nThat it was crazy because ... at the end of that with the Larson an al roller Johnson all have a different issues through the day jobs at the end they ended up at a three way tie the points at the end of this race and then the way the tie breakers work it's not number a second place finish is a third of the season is your best finishers in the round\nIt's Larson ... each had better finishes in the previous races Johnson's best finished around one was eight guess what race that was today here in Charlotte so he had out\nWell tough break there for Jimmy Johnson there'll be no a championship this year and the bigger picture Jimmy's running out of opportunities I I I think at the most optimistic thinking\nIt's probably two more season for Jimmy Johnson to race and I mean not that he needs the money or the fame or to achieve anything else but the abuses burning really fast and Jimmy Johnson to have an opportunity to capture that a\nRecord championship and I I think that's pretty reasonable assessment although he looked really racy today by the way the show's brought you in part by which filters follow which filters on Instagram at which filters and by Toyota Racing Alexis ... do you have the standings over there if you can\nBring those up real quick can you do a quick break down\nOn how the Toyotas finished today for our Toyota\nA update\nAnd their performance report from today's race\nAbsolutely a Denny Hamlin actually for being out um you know of the playoffs today was the highest finishing Toyota he finished in twelfth Martin stretch junior was fourteen uh Daniel Suarez twenty first\nWhat twenty first and then you know you had married a guy called Bush a most notably who was in that late race crashes in thirty seconds\nAnd not indicative of how they ran because obviously Barton dredge junior was leading up till about a hundred feet shorter the start finish line when he ... Johnson successfully took ... each other at that time so we ought to performance report presented by Toyota the latest Toyota Racing information visit Toyota Racing dot ...\nWe have a myriad of highlight sometimes we have a hard time compiling seven minutes of highlights today was not one of those time now for the highlights of the bank of America Robles four hundred dollars\nGame right over here we go history in the making\nAJ almost ... reading the bill delivering wagging the inaugural bank of America ... green\nNow than it is the bomb in part drawn in spite of all ...\nAll niggers still under attack by Alex Bowman into the theater was go left them back to the right third gear backup support here now they battle in the oval here comes once in a while\nAnd as you have any Hamlin hasn't damage\nHitting hitting team\nTo see them and they actually have\nMoved to the outside if they go through the decay side by side\nPain during the one hand\nTake the lead away from ... who is now being chased by Jason Eli\nBut number fifty one machine is buried wire barrier that his ... he has made a heavy heavy contact the miss the entrance of turn one and his nose that blue and red card and then the tire barriers is the caution is out here on the robo\n\nLarson is going to win stage number one in the in our World Bank of America\nHundred ... Bush will finish second but boy or a third markets rex junior ... is going to be chased Eliot the green why it gets back out here on the rubble at Charlotte motor speedway\nThe early ... side by side all trying\nBecause Jimmy Johnson got into his boat\nJimmy Johnson Kurt Busch Paul Leonardo making mode way\nTrying to get into the same household they'll\nOil industry have better set of tires or Jimmy Johnson number forty eight so he gets a little hard to get the inside walls and that was the outside of what got we've got to cut butter outbreak of they were turned over seven and he was going to have that position today that second spot the Jimmy Johnson level\nTracks junior Martin the threats junior fires his wife's part gets out of harm's way nobody else involved\nStates to go to wind blaming something we've not at all year long second\n[noise] they were pretty decent ways in front of me um but I could see him when I came off of the ... and I could see 'em a really close I mean they were nose to tail and\nI didn't really know what was going to happen or see a brief thought went through my mind it's like they might they might get together here but you don't really think anything of it but ah by the time I ... I came off\nOf the banking of the big track to the last ... and I saw the forty eight sideways and I guess then he'd put the Seventy eight and they both wanted I almost wrecked trying to watching them trying to get up and go you know because you want to you want to capitalize on even make the most of it so\nYeah I almost right in the ... trying to get by um but um yeah they're just racing really hard and uh you know you hate to see that happen you know I don't really\nIt's not really the way you want to win the not the first way you want to win but it kind of take what you can get nowadays but um and move on from it but I think the biggest thing like I said well we can look at it as we put ourselves in that spot to to make sure we capitalize on something like that if it happened and it did\nThey say it's banned the talk of the industry for months now has it kind of thinking yet to you that you are the\n... year old winner of the bank of America or over four hundred not really yeah I'm really thought about it you know once you you will race and they do they do so many things you know he's made so many\nWith this kind of hard to process for a little while so I'm sure it's sometime tomorrow it'll second but I'm not at school you know to win the first race of a new truck that was pretty neat that will always go down in history and then it was exciting\nDidn't finish and you know talking to the some of the fans I really enjoyed it a loved one though the front stretch interviews that you went to the cause your face to face it fans there that's a that's go and you can hear their energy you know because you go\nYou're the whole race without hearing fans at all you can't hear anything in the car if you asked me can you hear anything and nothing at all just engine noise and\nThen when you get out and you hear roar fans that are kinda brings it back to reality so that was a pretty nice but need to accomplish something that that no one else has but um hopefully the fans of joy I think that's the biggest thing called trophy to yeah I saw it it looks pretty neat looks like the uh\nMake America building and with the ruble inside of it so that's a pretty nice\nYou realize you're the only guy on the planet that has that trophy [laughter] you know I haven't thought about that so now he just blew my mind [laughter] crazy [laughter]\nThere'll be a duplicate here but uh I'll get to duplicate but I'm the team will get the get the real one for sure but because they deserve it but that's pretty neat yeah I didn't even think that that's pretty amazing your fraternity of one fraternity of one yeah yeah\nWell obviously we don't want to take you from this awesome moment too soon but you had advanced into the next round or are there any tracks coming out the ... in the next round of racist between Dover Talladega Kansas that you might have circle that um you know attract that you can capitalize on it and make sure you move on to sit around\nYeah you know honestly to round we're most worried about what is the first round yeah there's been some tracks that you know we usually run pretty good uh Vegas but we didn't have a great day in Richmond is always a struggle for us\nAnd then the robot you don't know what's going to happen so are the first round kind of worried us and I figured you know we all thought if we could get by this first round we'd have a second round there some contracts in there for us I mean the third round so um that was our main goal\nAnd we we accomplish that goal today before we ended up winning the race and um you know we did what we need to do which was points away and now we're ... before this who wrecked but um I think the second round is going to be pretty good for us and looking forward to but uh some good tracks and air force just try to\nTake this momentum and keep going with it that's what I knew you were really adapt\nRon it's social media have you sent anything out yet or if you had even a chance\nTo know I keep my phone in my motor home I I don't right before I Walk out the intros I leave it in there and I haven't seen it yet so uh I mean\nI probably blown I hate to say I had a few methadone might be for Oakland um\nBut but no yeah it's it's cool to check your phone after that and see the people that section or some are old friends and we talked to a long time so that part's pretty cool but looking forward to seeing you know some people tonight and and uh ... some people back so I'm excited my family was there my dad\nAnd this is the first race my dad's been to in like six weeks he's been he finally got a weekend operation then we happen to win it so that's a that's pretty cool I might keep renting might be a good luck\n[laughter] have you changed it to interact with it now\nHe was a ... a him my mother was home um\nMy ... six months pregnant sister six my sister was or was there so she lives in West Virginia so it's good to see her and my best friends back home so it's always nice to have family there when things like that happened but yeah dad came to ... he was a he was pretty uh pretty happy pretty surprised like I was but that was cool to share that moment and\nI'm quoting him there is a good day to be a blind you then yeah\nWell congratulations I Know you said it wasn't the way you might have planned it but the red sea part in the floodgates opened up and you were adapted not the one thing I was thinking as I'm watching that on the call and I'm just screaming\nAs okay he can't run through the sugar cane you have you had to finish that oh yeah\nTo get the win that's what got me nervous because you know you see those guys recognition spinning and\nWon it it's really bad when you see this all the time as a okay let's say

simply a fee they pay your company for the stamp of approval that seems a bit dumb but it did make me think about asking what is the process for investors\nTo become advisers to become a smart register well your parents' financial advisor is a liar\nShow you should stay away from him because he wouldn't know the truth a bit him on the butt\nSo no the only ... yeah we just take money from any idiot out there that says he's an advisor and then we send all of you people to them and there's never been any back black backlash oh come on that's absolutely asinine that's ridiculous\nOf course I couldn't get away with that you people which streaming up social media would be full of the complaints\nAnd rightly so now\nI've got a hundred person team\nThat works on the smart rest her

Jeff Wallace Chris right and Jeff Wallace lead a ... northern Virginia Potomac Gary a Tea Party and walk away clubs\nAnd I told you the story several months ago when the Potomac Tea Party reached out to the walk away group in the DC metropolitan area and it said what do we do some stuff together and\nSo we're going to visit with the two of those uh although having announced that I got a dozen or so emails from people saying\nDon't do I do walk away is just just a it's a Russian collusion at\nThe edge and for each thing do you do you buy those walk away do you buy the ... there were people that don't believe that Democrats can walk away from the Democratic party\nThat ... that we're just hoping that the Democrats start treating the Democratic party the way the Tea Party treated the Republicans that the ...\nCrafts start treating the Democratic party the way the Tea Party treated the Republicans\nThat the Republicans are hoping that the Democrats become fractured because as I said yesterday on the program talking with Kevin McCarthy I got you know why they email saying I Can't believe you said that to Kevin McCarthy while I was going to do beat me up\n\nShould walk away saying that you had there's as you walk away and they're saturated this interviews over ... ... if it wasn't for other Republicans I don't think Republicans would ever lose\nJust based on conservative principles\nWhen sixty percent of Charlottesville city residents get the fact that property rights despite being campaigned against private property ownership rights by the Democratic party of Charlottesville when the Democratic party of Charlottesville is against you being able to own something\nI Can't believe we've waited this long for a walk away\n\nSci fi is\nSees Virginia Tech football\nHere on WC [noise]\nTreaties every every time these cats me each in your name id Charlottesville city council they they seem to again I have a master class in why nothing ever gets done if you count on government to do it for you\n\nIt's because it's a balance handing money out to their friends that's all it is\nWest Bellamy lays it out for you so\nOne of the things that troubles me\nWhen we ... housing meeting we talked about\nFrom the community engagement beef\nOne fear was a focus will be hard I mean they have to work with\nThe same organizations that do come in the hour each one of those ...\nThose same organizations will get a very small piece of the ... sugar peas\nSo it's not about making affordable housing it's about handing taxpayer money out to their friends\nIt's good to be the king isn't it this is why\nNothing ever gets done I mean they they they just master catered for what seemed like an interminable period of time about ... ...\nThere isn't enough housing show it costs too much there I'll do that for Nineteen dollars and forty cents and you can send the two hundred thousand other dollars back to the taxpayers how 'bout that\nYour morning you're on the air with Joe Thomas in the morning news this\nMorning optimist how're you doing sir\nI find it amazing listening to this operation shawl coming up\nAverage patient about Charlotte there that I mean I'm an artist and he had gone out on you know or is that you\nAre at home and\nI just I mean I like the you know I like them all in\nYour your where as a master's degree and they they actively passwords with anyone around work off the map agreed on top of the real work\nYet in Charlottesville out there that contains over five pounds and [noise] you got to be a sitting there with\nI found them to read certain charm ... God [noise] [noise]\nWell but that's but that's exploitive optimist you know that's exploiting a young person you can't you know it's the same reason we don't have an internship programs in apprenticeship programs anymore because that's exploitive\nAh as somehow it's the greedy rich guy getting fat and happy over the exploits of a young person who's you know basically an indentured student now I don't believe that that's but that's the rhetoric of the left that's why you don't have a print the ships programs anymore because they they viewed it as exploitive\nAh and that's why you can't use UVA students to do your consulting anymore because that's ripping off the poor kids who who are you know just give you free labor never mind the fact that they have a resume\nBuilder now that could go out into the workforce and say oh yeah by the way a while I was in school I already help develop the Affordable housing project for a Charlottesville city and uh that's why you should hire me as your city manager or whatever whatever it is\nTheir career my lead them to or maybe they wanted to be ... if you're up your right they're they're the ones who are lost in this age ... world of you know it's somebody else's money in a bag of it said you guys in green county you're\nYou've gotta you've got a bunch of pork ... no pun intended to the pig roasted coming up on Saturday 'cause that's conservatives eating actual pulled pork\nOr you know the the the the metaphorical pulled pork is rolling fat and happy down the streets of Rutgers ... because there's a whole lot of money floating around looking for affordable housing solutions and green county wants to stick its hands into that\nWell then again I'll Try to stay on that you know this subject about you know I just absolutely ... the the idea that you cannot and years and I mean why not and the court and quite honestly\nThat's why and ours is like why I went to wear ... and getting married or because they have actual hearing from standing there very often\nOn land where they have no they had you know what to do it you know not in the law professor doesn't say man they got no not\nThat you're absolutely what I didn't say I disagree with you I'm just laying out why these people don't want to do that anymore because uh there are there are people that will hit them for\nExploitation ah and so you you can't touch the college students until they graduate and then of course they graduate and you can go you can go higher the college students to make ... for you but uh I don't know what else they're qualified for at that point\nOptimist it is it's a sad state of affairs supposedly\nOr you are but uh I don't know what else they're qualified for at that point a optimist\nIt is it's a sad state of affairs supposedly the Mac entire school in the dark in school or two of the most esteemed business schools\nIn the nation are at very least public business schools in the nation or they should be the ones we're turning to this should be a partnership with the dart in school and the city of Charlottesville not some outside consultant that wants to hundred grand\nAnd the fact that I\nI'm ... years after I really don't work or are you oh yeah\nI'm In the ... athletes going after but I Will tell you is a major hey I Want in industry I Am working are masters at a real\nSituation where there is something back at work where I work currently working and goodness play out from\nUnder panic if they are they all had to have kids coming out with ...\n... and if you really want to do the you know you you want to be able to sleep in your progressive bed at night or you can even set it up as a scholarship fund\nFor the students and say okay who's who you know which group gets a winning bed or you know will kick into your scholarship fund it would still be less than two hundred thousand dollars they're going to pay some consulting firm\nOr for their efforts are and\nAnd they'll get some twenty five year old engineering student or you know a architectural design student who's making far less than that so you're actually winding up screwing a bunch of young people\nAre in the process because they're going to be working for pennies on the dollar whereas if you did a scholarship grant where each one of these kids that worked on the project to UVA\nI've got a year's worth of their tuition covered by the city of Charlottesville city of Charlottesville is still making out into the old far less than two hundred thousand dollars probably a and a and the kids are actually getting you know where you're closer to their goal without\nHaving to um without having to collect more debt ironically this is actually one of the campaign planks of Corey stewards he brought it up at the forum down at Liberty University was the the this kind of stuff\nIs what we need to be supporting or maybe it is a little bit like the Pennsylvania model Pennsylvania's education system is so much better\nUh the top to bottom then Virginia's a in terms of even just being honest with each other the charter schools are really charter schools and that kind of thing uh it's such a better\nSystem up there than we have here but for some reason we we feel hamstrung I don't know what it is a optimist but we are\nOr permanent physical handicap and that's the insulting thing that the left does the left for each poverty like it's some intellectual disability and it really is infuriating that it just is\nIt's like you know the temperature oh I'm Sorry I Know the left believes the temperature is changeable and the man to enough tax payer expenditures can change the temperature but it can't for some reason change poverty\nIsn't that strike you as ironic\nSo when I when I think about people leaving the Democratic party I Know people who are just done with this kind of street theater theatrics that go on Corey stored given give brother credit\nAt the municipal league they ... that says this is a city government union these are the same folks that one or the gender Twenty one and it clearly\nTook your tax dollars and lobbied your representatives to take more of your tax dollars\nBy joining a gym to Twenty one that that the Virginia municipal league and the organization of cities and counties so\nGive Corey credit for going into the lion's den and the first place\n\nPart of Danville problem is going to be Charlottesville problem because in Danville is been ignorant since then river mill shut down\nBut we need to be Charlottesville problem because in Danville is been ignorant since Dan River mill shutting down\n\nIt's the same thing Suffolk County did win Northrop Grumman stop making fighter jets it's the same\nThing buffalo did when they stopped shipping or through the Erie Canal\n\nAnd nobody stopped and said hey maybe this real ... when when they stopped cranking cars out of Pontiac, Michigan\n\nAnd nobody stopped and said gee I Wonder why that stopped and finally there's somebody in the White House that says maybe it should just stopped maybe we should have done something about stopping\nBut part of the reason Danville is to a great degree Virginia's version of Detroit is because of city counselors that walked out of this means you know resulted\nYou're talking about closed up stores well you know how are you talking about closed up stories maybe the people in Danville need to get a little he owed at their city council for not doing anything about the boarded up stores this is what I believed drives this walk away movement is finally somebody of a Republican\nBent the president\nCalls amount for who they are goes to black churches and says what's been going on for fifty years has it gotten any better\n\nAnd the black community says ah do in the city council just get all of ... offended then the storm out and they say the president's ... because it comes in here and says our city is bad and we are good people every year yeah you do when they deserve better\n\nYeah you do have good people in Danville and yeah we have great people living on hearty drive and then friendship court and they deserve better than the you know these cash gravity little pork barrel shoppers that\nMass graves city counselors and supervisors and everyone else who fiddles while your community burns\n[noise]\nI Love this street theater because you all were offended because gory stored pointed out that we have closed up and boarded up shops I got the same crap when I point out that you know a popcorn stand does not make a storefront on the downtime all you know they may be in there but that doesn't that if\nThey're using twenty percent of the storefront space just to say that there's somebody in the store front [noise]\nYou Dr Keith water it away from downtown where you might have actually have a few more customers for the downtown businesses that by the way you were stored large sums of money from\n[noise] and then you sit there and you match the gate\nYourself over affordable housing how about making it so that there are more people who can afford the hours that would be easier oh you know but but with enough taxpayer dollars we can change the temperature but poverty is you know I'm Sorry poverty is just something you were afflicted with [noise]\nIt infuriates me because then you know people say that we you and me the conservative ones are the ones who have the poor Corey Stewart have support going sort of NATO support he wants Danville have open up stores and things like that [noise]\nAnd by pointing it out maybe somehow like I Do hear [noise]\nIt might get fixed one of these days [noise] but instead you've got elected officials who take umbrage [noise]\nStorm out of meetings saying well we have good people live in Danville yeah you do have good people to live in\n... [noise] and storm\nOut of meetings saying well we have good people live in Danville yeah you do have good people to live in Danville and they deserve a crap load better then you're delivering them [noise]\nIn representation [noise] back Scott Sports nice W ... five forty four\nNow and I think you really can you tell people I met my identity our dog he's quite up high about how you get a lot of the party you know if anything they\nCame up in the book Instagram store and shelter pet amazing adoption stories dirt and shoulders is at the shelter pet project out or to find a pet near you brought to you by Matisse on the humane society the United states and the account\nDone with this sportsmen of or Tuesday October second the Milwaukee Brewers became National League central division champion just today with a three one went over the cubs it regularly it's the brew cruise suck in division titles since Nineteen eighty two the cubs remain home to face Colorado tonight in the wild card game\nThe Rockies lost and the Dodgers yesterday meanwhile the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals will raise their banner tomorrow night\nAnd begin their season with Boston uh kept one two three and two during the pre season\nConcluding this past Sunday the new coach Tom Reardon was impressed away the team return to begin the year\nThe biggest takeaway for me was how they all showed up in the camp and we're in shape and ready to go and I'm excited to get started here on a on the third\nWednesday's open and we'll be hurt on one of seven five and twelve sixty WC age vague in a battle of two of the eight unwritten teams left in college soccer number eleven Virginia plays host to write state tonight the raiders come to town with a record of eight oh and one the cabs are five oh into I'm done with the sports minute for Tuesday October second\nBut I heard you guys\nWay more [noise]\nHe's in the closet experienced they'll never\nBy ... by the participating ... like ... areas on lucky charm for a ten dollar ticket master to get cash how\n\nCan you know they had what he said he too hot for conditions to CBS\nSeventeen whether authority forecast partly cloudy and warm today\nChance for an isolated African shower thunderstorms high temperatures in the mid eighties and gradual clearing tonight with Lowes in the mid sixties sunny and hot on Wednesday heights upper eighties for sunshine and still hot on Thursday high temperatures upper eighties tenure Ninety degrees\nI'm CBS Nineteen ...

the schools and if you speak out against it you're gonna get six or seven people in the parking lot chasing after you it's like Chicago back in the thirties Korea I mean is it ... you know I don't know how to tell people more strongly to stand up against it\nBut you know it's I only have one house who's windows can get broken but all these other folks that they're afraid sometimes and I think that's a sub text to this\nOh I think so too and I'll tell you though are there going everywhere I go now everybody a south West Virginia or where I spent this past weekend in this uh uh yesterday and I was in Hampton Roads but people all over Virginia here in northern Virginia as well people are very upset\nA that a good man a Brett Kavanaugh a is being disparaged in this way or ... with the famed his whole a reputation everything based upon rumors from somebody who is ... doesn't have her story straight you know\nYou look at her she's a sympathetic figure already know that something bad has happened to her in the past but there is absolutely zero evidence that it was him\nAnd yet these rumors that are thirty six years old from his high school years are being used it as fair just man and here's the thing people know it could happen to them to\nYou know every man in America especially men not just men and women too but especially men are very concerned\nThat you know these accusations from a long time ago you could come up against them even if they didn't do it\nAnd instead of being you know the the the burden on the person who makes accusation to prove that it actually happened\nIt's been flipped by that the Democrats and now they're trying to make him prove that he didn't do it you know thirty six years after this uh supposedly happened nobody could nobody can prove their innocence under such a scenario well and that's why it's had if people are reacting in a very negative and very angry way rightfully so\nWell all you have to do is think about guilty until proven innocent and if it was you I don't even have to be hypothetical when I ran restaurants I had that happened to me and I thank goodness the employer I worked for was willing to kind of poke around enough to figure out that there was this girl is George\nAh but I I don't know what I Would have done otherwise I certainly can be a Supreme Court justice not that you were going to nominate me guys are really really you take one step further because we see\nThat would have done otherwise I certainly can't be a Supreme Court justice not that you were going to nominate me go to ... or ... you take one step further because we see these videos that James O'Keefe it promptly project very tosses done with these actual government employees talking about\nUsing their access to federal databases to get addresses of people so that they can\nGo take their protest marches and threatened their children I mean there's just a scary scary stuff Corey\nUh you know please tell me that if you get into the Senate or you know when you get there you you're trying to lead the charge to turn it at very least punish the swamp monsters who are out there weaponize and our governor government against us never mind things like Pfizer warrants get being given out you know at the drop of a hat\nWhile I'm not going to tolerate it I think your people ... know enough about me to know that I'm going to\nA fight this fight a very very hard and I'll tell you something to there's a lot of people who work men and women who work in our government right now and a federal government who are afraid to speak their minds if they have more traditional values they are afraid to speak their mind if they have conservative thoughts and political beliefs\nThey're afraid of being ostracized the side of the workforce they're afraid that they're they can be fired or laid off\nA transfer or someplace that they don't want to go there they're afraid of that their job prospects and their ... possibilities that advancement inside the government can be cut short if they don't speak all the politically correct things that if they don't if they if they have conservative thoughts and beliefs are just traditional beliefs nuts\nAnd I think that this is something people are waking up that they're not just going after Brett Kavanaugh\nThey're going after traditional America They're going after against all of us any of us who was pointed put in that position never go after us too\nAnd these these men and women who are sitting up there like Dianne Feinstein and ah and Cory Booker I mean they're they're hypocrites there covering up their own sexual harassment charges using your tax money\nAnd yet at the same time they're yelling sexual harassment at Brett Kavanaugh when there's absolutely no evidence they actually did have these things you know it's just the the absolute height and hypocrisy and people are disgusted with what's happening in the scent I'm going there to burn the place down\nThat's what I'm going to do we're going to rile it all up because it's got to be taken back\nWe got to take it back we the people need to take back the United States Senate fire Tim Kaine\nWell that's why you're insurgent right now in research and then and I think Tim Kaine is on the ropes uh personally I I I hear him you know getting more and more desperate I had a friend of mine whisper to me and he said I don't know Tim Kaine and Leslie Coburn signs I don't know if that ... helps or hurts Tim Kaine [laughter]\nWell you know you hear the woman\nWho says Israel is the greatest problem ... and I guess it's true we don't believe in the ten commandments any more so than those rules for the Israelis I guess that just fits into what Cory\nBut I'm looking forward to the forum in Hampton Roads are at Hampton University\nOn Wednesday nights or any anything special for it or you just uh you just gonna ready to take questions from the kids I Love your answer about college admissions I

be held this evening at seven o'clock so tuned in for that but there's a lot more there's a foreign going on there and Hampton and yes this issue\nOf uh you know look it's time to end affirmative action in this country it's wrong that we're using people's race against them in college admissions and other places it's state sponsored discrimination\nTree it's wrong that we're using people's race against them in college admissions and other places it's state sponsored discrimination that you know college applicants high school students who are I happened to be Asian and half the score two hundred and eighty points higher\nOn their SAT scores than other students to get into colleges like UVA and other elite educational institutions this is wrong it's wrong it's splitting Americans a young Americans on along racial lines it's time to end up that terrible practice\nWell I Know that there is actually potentially a Supreme Court case that could be hurt by Brett Kavanaugh this session about that very thing Corey so it's going to make it a very very touchy\nSubject to the CBS stations are going to make sure our friends with the news voice habit\nOr the debate and they know the forum

going to be good people that ever want to say yes to yeah positions like this I wouldn't say yes who wants to live through this\nWell I think the the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that at the FBI supplemental background check does it change things\nSixty percent of the people leave the judge Kevin I should be on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high who would follow Kevin ... after this\nThey will destroy everything we stand for us Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to us why is it always just us\nThis is a time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh get into votes he needs he's a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions\nOr you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered about all the right people just so yeah I mean people that hate me too so I don't know I don't think you find that I Will tell you that I don't think you had a fine or moment in all the years I've known you and\nThat are rooted in you know laws are rooted in truth\nProcess due process constitutional law presumption of innocence all declaring they believe even before people were heard you cannot have because if that's now the standard your guilty\nBy accusation you argue anybody can make any accusation\nAnd I believe the accusation we have no rule of law at that point throughout the whole process nobody\nAnd I have watched this process now one fold was Richard jewel Duke lacrosse Ferguson, Missouri Cambridge police or Baltimore, Maryland Trayvon and George Zimmerman everybody thinks they know\nAnd they all end up being wrong because they rush to judgment and maybe with the FBI investigation and the disaster is interview on NBC yesterday\nMaybe now people understand that it's falling apart\nAnd people's names character reputations families they bludgeoned\nFor political reasons or a good friend Amy Kramer is checking in with us or Amy Hi how are you you're wonderful daughter Kiley is now joined our

there [laughter]\nShe's doing we love and it always wanted to I appreciate you at all you you do and the teams\nThat Sean I have to tell you something I never in my life it's better to be on the same page with Lindsey Graham and inviting had to one of our of that and actually we've done that this week um he's he just I mean he ... us all last week that he not\nWell I think ... you know and that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament now if you're if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault and you're innocent\nHow was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone of guys I didn't do this so it's just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and it ... it right it is and\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroyed in the process of accumulating power\nAnd honestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and I\nAnd I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal women these he kept wearing liberal women out there speaking like they speak for all women\nThey don't they absolutely do not end when the press in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones\nFirst sixty ... since the Nineteen sixties women have the deciding vote women were the ones that don't like the Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the in the mid term and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kinda that\nTogether and we're pushing back on all of this and said they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I looked at said it's going to hold a vote and a big Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it ... the the convinces them he's not qualified for the job you know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink you drink beer still likes to drink beer sometimes drink more beer that he should have drink\nAnd then people say what he must have blocked out we know that he's a liar he's perjure right and now they want to investigate in ice throwing incident at some game you know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I can tell you what we're doing and two days and that is we're having a women for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's limited for America first heels on gloves off\nAnd women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to be bold in our support the president and Brett Kavanaugh and on Thursday were taken a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most\nConservatives are working but we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\n'em to support to confer Brett Kavanaugh\nBut we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\nOn his support to confirm Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this vote on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nWell I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may but no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report and when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce\nWill senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions they don't make recommendations they just say interviewed person a B C D E F G\nAnd but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case\nAfter case there's inconsistencies and every single case is very problematic and all I'm saying is is if this is successful we will never ever get good people ever in this kind of ... like do want to do anything\nPublicly why should they\nSean I completely agree it's a political his job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed hands so glad to see Lindsey Graham\nScanned what the ... with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats that so and I hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have them and that just keep up the fight\nAll right thank you so much Amy for being with us we are very proud of highly is now part of the Sean Hannity show\nAnd she's the one that's answering everybody's calls

calls and emails in just a moment I started out with the president's comments that were in a terrible spot today where a man and it primarily applies to men although you could easily see the same kind of scandal involving women but that a man is accused and if he's accused he's guilty\nUntil he proved himself innocent that's been the just the Kavanaugh investigation from the beginning of this which you'll remember I'll point out started at what was supposed to have been the end of all of the hearings\nInto confirming him as a Supreme Court justice offering gaffes and he joins me now who's founder and president of the center for security policy and Frank\nIs a little outside of what we usually talk about here but uh but I Want to know do we know which FBI's investigating Kavanaugh is this the corrupt one\nThat had to have a ... a number of people like call me and McCabe and others fired or is this one that can actually turn around a a good solid investigation and quiet some of these democratic protest\n[laughter] well I don't think anything's gonna stylistic democratic process because this isn't about\nHis record this is about uh what he would do on the porch yeah they're determined to wage political warfare against until they destroy it ended I\nOf course the state of the court outlook lawyers I I don't know the answer that question I I think it's tremendously important what we have a reason to believe that the guys who would be doing\nThe investigation of the charges would be you know drawn from the large ranks of\nPatriotic law\nEnforcing and law abiding FBI agents\nThe trouble is that I'm quite certain that there are among the ranks of the leadership of the FBI still people liked in the caves and like the cold days and like the pages and struck some bakers and so on and those people may or may not\nBe able to do much at this point a to corrupt\nWhat comes out of the field investigations the background investigation but I think we have to take it as a gift and that they'll do whatever they can\nBecause this is part of the counter state it's not just deep state truthfully it's like counter state and they are\nAs in bed and is determined to defeat Donald Trump and his presidency is any of those Democrats on the Judiciary Committee or elsewhere in the Senate or for that matter you know that that that resist and anti tapes I'm afraid\nHere's what I'm thinking about Frank because one of the questions of because we have this press corps that is just dead set against Trump\nWhat they never considered is that we have three branches of government you know judicial legislative and executive\nThe judicial who is you know they were considering coming off of that the legislative branch because of the insistence of Jeff Flake has said we want the executive branch the FBI which is under the executive branch to investigate this even though\nThe legislative branch has its own resources to do this I I Know that people maybe haven't thought of this\nBut the Senate Judiciary committee has a huge staff of people who are professional investigators and who have the expertise to do the very same thing that the FBI is doing except I Wonder whether the Democrats no we've got some deep state\nAnd who have the expertise to do the very same thing that the FBI is doing except I Wonder whether the Democrats no we've got some deep stayed friends over in the FBI who as you said are still there and they're still willing to carry water forests will produce the result we won\nInstead of the result they might get from the ... from the Congress's own investigators who are perfectly capable of looking into this because all the FBI is doing right now for the most part\nIs interviewing people and asking questions well there are people on the Senate Judiciary committee staff who could be doing that too and it would be directly under the control of Congress although it would be under the control of a Republican Congress\nRight well that's the rub isn't it you know I had an interesting conversation today with a syllabus jak cash show who you were in Denver I chose a you interviewed back when he published a book about TWA eight hundred wish exposed\nWhat the corruption that the FBI and the CIA during the Clinton Administration meant in terms of essentially covering up what actually happened taking down

yep\nUh of course the Clinton Hillary Clinton email scandal thing or another and and this most recent one more solar celebrating barking I should say the anniversary of in this week and that is the Las Vegas shooting I think all of these have been\nInstances where people in leadership in the FBI did the ... and and co opt\nThe work of that organization which is needed by our country\nUm and unfortunately has damaged the reputation of the whole enterprise as a result of what these guys have done so I think that was operating for some Democrats it's kind of amazing today that uh it wasn't a concern to Republicans given what we've been watching play out here while I was just one of those scandals with those recent one Hillary's\nAnd think about this Frank I mean I think this is relevant\nThey missed the pulse nightclub and I won't even have the whole is 'cause I'm doing this for memory they missed on may lose cruise at Parkland, Florida the up probably high you know I understand\nThere are good people who work there I Know some people who work at the FBI the lower ranks in the region ranks I Do too that agency as an agency even at the local field office in say Florida\nHas screwed up and we've seen these screw ups and we've documented number of the screw ups where we've watched in real time as their screw up led to literally dead bodies in American cities\nAnd then we said but we can trust them to do a competent job of investigating something that seems\nWell the the longer that that goes on since you know last week since last Thursday the more we seem to be seeing this story fall apart a Julie sweat story is falling apart the W ... story is falling apart\nAnd even a a Christine Cooke story is falling apart and yet still vote we've got an agency that has occasionally produced a you know bad results or no result or political results doing the investigation\nBut you know human I've talked about this a lot over the years bars but one other piece of this which again I think is a function of bad leadership has been um the fact that lots of these ages good people most of all I without it stipulate that virtually all of them are\nHas been um the fact that lots of these ages good people most of all I without it stipulate that virtually all of them are good people that field level people but they've been denied training\nAbout the

but we'll recall before was the director of the FBI and he said\nWe're not going to have people training in a way that would offend or Islam or Muslim said so these are the kinds of issues that have caused people that I admired greatly a fellow particularly I'm sure you know Chris feral yup\nOf judicial watches said listen we need to start over you know they suggest using the U.S marshals office

need a do over\nYeah I think we do less than a minute Frank ... comment on the attempt apparently to assassinate the James Mattis today\nAbout it\nThe right thing about it at all and below full of rice and sent to the Pentagon address to General Mattis so you know I mean we're in a strange time and and I and I hate to say it but I kinda think that that was a domestic attempt maybe we'll find out different later on but\nThat would give Trump not just this pick the pick of judge Kavanaugh but another pick on top\nThat wouldn't set the courts ideological direction I Believe to say we're going to follow the constitution or for the next forty years or so given the age of the current justices\nIf they do and if the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh by the end of this week two things are going to happen one cabinet won't be seated too there isn't enough time to pick a replacement and run them through the vetting process\nAnd a lot of Republican voters will look at the cave in by the Republicans and say\nI may not show up in November to vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not a ... and we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both and if that happens then America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on then we have a court that will follow the constitution instead of following ideology\nAnd I think the Republicans are voters ahead of the midterm election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word by saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do and that will reflect in their votes in November So ... we really are at a big divide right now\nIf Kavanaugh gets gets in great things are going to happen if he does not I think America we ... we may lose the Republican Congress and Donald Trump won't get another thing done for the next two years and they will set themselves the Democrats will set themselves up well for twenty twenty\nWith what's been starting to me a lot in regards to that as\nA Democrat that seems like they they pick and choose what they want to follow up to date a lot of followed up by the way around to find a way to read or\nWhat is your experience as we all have no immigration it's all open border and there'll be a systematic disarmament either that it's just\nI think you're absolutely right and and and and consider that that not only do the Democrats invent invite a oh boy we just got word cliff I'd mentioned to Frank ... the James Mattis at the Pentagon received a letter didn't go all the way to him but they intercepted as contending rice and\nA judge my producers just solar me that we just got word that Trump also received a letter had they confirmed that there was rice and are they saying just white powder at this point\nA Ted Ted Cruz's office got a letter was or two letters with white powder and apparently President Trump's office also received a letter with white powder in it which is designed to at least frightened and terrorize\nA if not actually do damage will have to find out what the white powder is but I wanted to work that in but think about what's going to happen if if we go this\nOr if not actually do damage will have to find out what the white powder is but I wanted to work at in but think about what's going to happen if if we go this direction we want people on the court who will follow the constitution the Democrats actually invent things that were never in the constitution for example\nIt might surprise people to know that\nThat privacy is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution but there had been Supreme Court decisions that had been AAA did privacy into the constitution marriage is not mentioned by the constitution but now we have a famous Supreme Court decision recently\nDid found a right to marriage and a right to gay marriage in the constitution if the Democrats are allowed to gain control and put people on the court who would say we can invent things that are not in the constitution\nAnd if the Congress won't pass a law will get the Supreme Court to effectively write a law then a lot of your rights are going to go away\nBut I don't think they realize is that they're\nYou know what I lost your cell phone and I'm Sorry for that cliff let's go to Dave Dave ... were tied to the break but what's on your

SAY Media columnist from the hill and host of what America is thinking on the hill TV Joe welcome to the program\nWas I think this is my first time on with you\nI it is your first time on and and you're very welcome to be here we rely on the hill a lot you folks do a fairly good job and fairly down the middle unlike a few other publications on line that I might mention like the ... when the New York times\nUh yeah that makes us an anomaly at this point which is kind of scary right but I appreciate it I'm Glad that check let's say but\nYeah well what we're just imagine Joe what'd you God is you have the potential to talk to both sides and that's twice as big a group is just talking to one side I mean if you're if you're somebody who's in the media business don't you want to sell to both sides of the aisle including Republican you know\nThe low forehead or Neanderthal types like me as well as the elite types who read the New York times over there are there ... there are a lot to say\nI'm a journalism perspective or our stories are shared the most by Republicans and Democrats you know most of the time when you were talking about members of Congress\nOh well I'm from a journalism perspective ah our stories or share the most by Republicans and Democrats you know most of the time when you were talking about members of Congress so\nYou know a lot of members of Congress will just share you know if you're conservative by part or Fox News or drugs you know a link from there or whatever but and then Democrats obviously will do MSNBC CNN and so on but uh if I was with us we we could share the most from both sides that's become a business perspective Larson methods athlete great point which is\nYeah wouldn't get make more money at a wider audience of bigger than that so yeah or editorial page goes left and right which is fine we we have opinions from both sides that are are reporting a straight down the middle and that that's the way everybody should should go about their business but uh it's certainly an anomaly and then the exception rather than the rule\nIt also seems odd to that in the coverage of judge Kavanaugh usually reporters are a bit skeptical about just about everything especially claims that you know you can't prove absolutely\nAnd and yet I've seen a lot of skepticism go right out the window that if it's if it's Christian Ford making the allegation it must be true after all she says this was done to her\nThirty six years ago even though she can't remember the details whereas judge Kavanaugh he's just a big heavy drinking loud who was apparently involved in a legit rape parties at one point but also stayed secret for the last third of the century you find that believable don't you\nI mean I I think this is one of the worst moments in our media is that a lot of bad moments political maybe I'm Talking about specifically a and ever since the president took office obviously during the two thousand six team but I Can't remember it being as bad\nAs we're seeing it now and I always just kind of put it to this question if this was a Democratic president who nominated a ... for third nomination for the Supreme Court\nWould we see even the Christine forward story getting any legs whatsoever because to your point doesn't do what had happened where it happened how she got home or she's contradict yourself on a couple of occasions in terms of um too afraid to fly I Can't testify in this day and it turns out that\nYou know she flies a lot I mean a little thing that you could say well that's just a little thing big deal but\nHey I mean that goes to credibility and then the stories that we have today Lars like Brett Kavanaugh was involved in a bar fight a veil and Nineteen eighty five and he threw ice said somebody I mean well for for for starters he's a genius because when you think about it the weapon destroys itself right I mean it's\nLike an ice bullet well and the other thing is finding kids in college who drink beer on Friday nights and sometimes get into either ice fights or food fights is probably not that difficult is it\nTime one of them [laughter] I just confessed on Twitter that I started a massive fight at Boston College my uh my freshman year I wasn't going Arizona Emerson College in Boston but I was visiting some friends and I did start one that is true and yes a later at my senior year I did pour a picture of beer\nOver another friend at a free beer festival type of thing and yet I mean this is what you do it's ... use this is all part of it but I think now the goalposts moved so much on this that\nIt seems that Democrats and partisans in the media seemed to be making the argument that if Brett Kavanaugh lied about how much he drank and college than he that disqualifies him for the Supreme Court okay\nSo that means that Beto O'Rourke who is running for the Senate in Texas against Ted Cruz Jeb who had a DUI\nAnd reportedly left the scene of that accident or when he was Nineteen and college wrote a paper about the the ... and ... and ... of of women of actresses and a play that means he's disqualified and then I can go right down the list\nA paper about the the ... and and ... of of women of actresses a play that means he's disqualified and then I can go right down the list of Ninety eight percent of of the of the Senate and Congress where people will be disqualified\nBased on the new rules that are being presented it is a dangerous precedent that we're seeing here and I think that's why people are so invested in in Kavanaugh getting confirmed not because he's a conservative and you want to have another conservative on the court and gay in terms of ideology it's about principle that if you allow these tactics to work here they\nNo sane person able ever going to public service and be you'll never ever be able to get somebody uh approved outside the Supreme Court again because you could go back and find the one thing from their past and not even have a corroborated\nOr any evidence around it and that'll be enough to dismiss that person and destroy their life in the process that's why people are selling vested 'cause they know what the stakes are here and it's scary\nI'm Talking with Joe ... who's a media columnist for the hill and Joe I thought I'd share this this was just made for you as a media columnist to get a question like this from my see CNN and you know chicken noodle news network talking to the wonderful crazy Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nDo you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court\nBy the way he's in this in that case is the ice fight\nIranian and had the I mean there are a lot of ... and I mean part of LA are about how he behaves rain here talk\nNow this is crazy you've actually got in the media serious journalists supposedly had CNN saying\nDoes this ice thing disqualify him from the Supreme Court and Mazie Hirono quote a cooperates by saying yes this is why we need the FBI to look into this because of allegations like an ice fight with Chris Dudley at a bar in Connecticut but\nRight and and then when this investigation is wrapped up and it's being reported tonight the wall Street Journal that this could very easily be done by tomorrow morning this FBI investigation because again there's the ... you can investigate something where you don't know what time or a place of where the\nUh the board the event happened or no one can corroborate it so they interviewed a couple of people and they got through that will present their findings to the Senate and of course the Democratic side will leak out those findings press I can guarantee you that\nAh but yeah and then and then uh that senator from Hawaii will then say you know obviously this was er rushed FBI investigation we needed something larger scope and throwing them never be satisfied with this but this boat has to happen soon because the ... of the world and I call them\n... because he is like a cart asking really where he has no talented you see him on TV Everywhere\nSays something else will come out that will be completely and totally unfounded just to muddy the waters more and even if Kavanaugh gets confirmed large by the way the Democrats have one here they won the dirtiest way possible but but they've painted the GOP now as anti me too and Taiwan and and it's just such a shame that that people actually believe\nAny of these allegations when you consider there is not a skin killer of evidence around all three of them particularly the ... and yet he continue to get air time because no one wants to challenge him on basic facts\nJoe this is what makes your column well worth reading all the time and I just I've been telling my audience I've been having fun with this as well because it is kind of absurd it's like all the writers from Saturday Night live left SNL and you can tell and they all went to work as staffers on Capitol Hill but I've been telling them do you want your son\nHas a very small and large uh\nDown in city in it on a by all the way down from ... ... drivers to ... to ... uh to ordinary people in the streets and this has been going on for quite some time now and the best change in the best revolution comes when\nPeople would rise up against an oppressive regime or does a fuss on the outside can only support them\nBy saying that you know we are with you and of course as I said a\nDoes western countries European countries or still continuing to do business with Iran should also think twice about a continuing to do business with\nA country that has such a great human rights violations not because I say so but because it's all been documented or an amnesty reports and buy a those people who uh watch and monitor\n... nations across the guilt\nBecause that's the part where he'll do to perhaps the hardest for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran\nAnd ... across them go\nSee because that's the part where he owed ... perhaps the heart is for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the line\nOr as members of the world community I mean I I'm not for global movement or anything like that but I\nI think that when there are potential threat to the United states and when they have this kind of record with their own people end up sponsoring terrorist acts in their own region which are potential threats to the United states uh when when you know if you get disruption in that region it could cause problems all over the world\nWhy are the Europeans not climbing on board that and saying you're right these people are bad people are they just so focused these countries that want to do business with Iran on saying well but they got they got dollars because Obama gave the as you said given the dollars and we'd like to sell them stuff\nYes and they got dollars and they've got yeah so you know that relationship that I've had incest just relationship I had bought ... mind when you think about this and that you also mentioned that they don't sponsor\nTerrorism just within their own country for a sponsor the Hamas and has a lot of say did they find ...\nOutside of it on and that is why they're so dangerous so the money that says that
