I think one of the best things that we know about\nThe government will tell organized government to steal money for their kids or\nThe ... I think one of the best things that we know about the United states is this the death tax hit fewer than five percent of people depending on how you want to\nMeasure directly directly hits let anybody people by destroying the jobs are cutting their businesses and farms and out in terms of you know\nYou pay you act you pay the tax immediately or the farm that gets cut in half the business that gets cut now everybody who works for it may be in trouble but less than five percent Seventy percent of Americans have consistently set\nOr that they want the death tax Chappelle show Seventy percent so at least sixty five percent of Americans said I don't have the death tax not likely that fact but I just think it's wrong to attack somebody again and again and again uh on\nIncome that they've already paid taxes on at least once and and maybe more than once a depending on how they they are in the dollar a\nThat's a healthy country that is not a country\nOr that Obama thought he was present I've written by a and they remember on this comment when somebody said well you know why don't you cut the capital gains tax you know\nWhenever we've cut the capital gains tax revenue goes up when we increased capital gains taxes government actually um gets less money do you really want to raise the capital gains tax even if it\nCosts the government rather they said yes yes it's still the right thing to do show this was not about\nHaving more money to build a bridge or do something constructive this was I Would rather have a tax on success for people to punish that meant to hurt them even though I Know it will hurt\nPeople who depend on government spending or you know people work for the army or are they the legitimate functions of the government or even though it hit hurt them he's still liked the idea of attacks on capital gains shout and he\nWas more important than helping then whatever the government's supposed to be doing it to help the poor people right in the military um all those things that the government says that it does with our lovely money\nOr the American people are not where Obama wise which has consumed by and they and covering other people's stuff I mean and these one of the seven deadly sins and the Democrats act like it's a political progress\nAs you point out that sixty five Seventy percent of Americans don't like this soon as you say these are people who could very easily say I'll never be as rich or I Would not be so rich\nTo be able to have to pay the death tax but I don't want anybody else to say it either so you're right sixty percent of it maybe sixty five percent of Americans don't have that kind of envy\nAnd Obama's attitude toward money you remember when he said at some point you made enough money\nWell he is at this point the current estimates are that he's worth about forty million dollars he was worth about three million dollars when he came in and into the presidency and here we are two years out of his presidency that was worth forty and the estimates are\nHe'll have made a quarter billion dollars about Fifteen Years in you suppose anybody is going to remind him of what he said and say so President Obama when he got to a hundred million was that enough\nHow about a hundred and a quarter you know how 'bout how 'bout to when you got to two hundred million\nAnd you knew that the interest alone and that two hundred million would be about ten million dollars or in burnings on it would be about ten million dollars a year that you would earn for the rest of your life without giving another speech or anything else is that what you meant by enough money and if it isn't enough how much is enough\n... losing question I guess I guess that's clearly not enough\nMoney and if it isn't enough how much is enough\nLosing question I get I guess that's a big there there's not enough ah it yet there is a tremendous sad hypocrisy I'm ...\nI left a day and the other people's money they and the other people's success or and it's very sad it's unfortunate but we can avoid that being the leadership of the country and as you are saying everybody needs to remember this vote\nPlease if it says well by those take your\nUh your belt thing to deliver it to the polls mail it to the polls do not live without people do not throw it away people got\nAbout ... dumpster diving and that kind of LA they sell those to the local democratic committee Charlie ... both sides now is designed so that would have thought oh sure they would of fraud\nIn every state we're going to have some individual peculiar to use like building in a while you versus building in Alaska\nBut we should all have an agreement that there are certain things that are always going to build a certain way if we build an education system is not merely bad but as I should it became political and it became full of France and as you said a lot of parents would look at a map and say in particular and say I have no idea what you're talking about\nDon't know how to help you with their homework\nYeah you're exactly right and it especially becomes a problem when we're talking second first and second grade math parents are are are having trouble with it's not even the high school math which is where I my background is high school math and and\nHow do we get rid of it well like you said it it it's tall attack and it has to come from the bureaucracies from the top because\nCommon for comes from the top and that the inherent issue of Thomas or as a top down approach that the education reforms it takes power out of the hands of the experts as you called me a the teachers\nAnd it makes sure that some powerful bureaucrats at the top level many of them never have stepped foot into a foster homes are the ones that are dictating white\nStudents are learning how they are learning it\nAnd when they are learning it so I\nI take an Adam Smith approach to to education um I Believe that competition is is how schools are going to become better competition for better teachers that's\nGoing to increase or learning and and and numbers and that's and turns going to ah bring more tax dollars into a school district that has the schools um\nStandards nationalizing education at first like you said\nOn first glance sounds like a good thing um you know if you're moving from West Virginia to Connecticut you want to believe that your child will fit into the grades that the states as a child should be it yeah but that is just not what is happening unfortunately and ah so important because\nNow education has become a political issue and and we have to vote these people in the office that are going to make sure our kids has the best education and and so there's a line on our teachers want rely politician\nYou know while we've got the time tonight city in city Adams is the director of education for the foundation for liberty in American greatness which was fired um why are we teaching kids about the constitution and I know that for some people that he can quote ... how does not apply to my kids daily life well the fact is\nThat where you interact with your employees someday when you're an employer or as an employee interact with your employer when you're first school where you interact with the police are with the local government a lot of them\nYou have to know the constitutional rights that are guaranteed to document and what the government to love to do and what does not allowed to do I think to make you you know is sensible daily choices and even choices of the ... we're all going to do in a couple of weeks\nLars you're exactly right and an easy answer to that is that Common Core on measures by English language arts and by math and so\nThe constitution a really it can be used as an English language arts resource but it's more secondary as a instead of a primary historical document that kid should know before they graduate high school and\nWhat's so sad about this is the worst thing you look at the millennial generation which I I and as part of and\nAnd what's so sad about\nThis and say you know we're seeing you let the millennial generation which I I and as hard as\nAnd my generation increasingly does not like the country that they that they were boy ... and ... and they're constantly it's become a fad to talk about why you don't like this country\nI Believe that it was impossible to have that opinion of as a matter of fact if you noticed thankful you know why the founding fathers\nI set up the constitution the way they did to guarantee that you and I were able to keep our rights as opposed to the government giving us our life and I just think ... as far as because instead of students and teachers and parents um dictating how how's that their education is whether\nIt's that they ... and the educational rights are coming from the the high level that love your office and um and so on and on the side effects of common for is that\nSaid if education has decreased and as a result the satisfaction of our country is a crazy thing\nI saw it with my students [noise] uh how how does it tell me that you know usa deserve nine eleven um our God I Know my stomach and inspired

has really changed um but right now we are and that they did that too I'm hanging off our debt\nWe have paid off thirty thousand dollars and we started in May of this year to go on and we are questioning whether or not to we had we have a rough I\nRoth IRA and requesting on whether or not to poll from it to pay off one of our debt that we have um [noise] it's it's actually a travel trailer that we use with our children and we're wanting to keep it\nSo we want to pay it off on and I just we were sitting here and we're like we don't know whether or not a poll from it or not\nBut it would have allowed ...\nUm we owe twenty seven thousand on it um we're getting ready to make a payment of five grand here at the beginning of November we\nAllow for household so\nWe're getting ready to make a payment of five grand here at the beginning now than we are tired out\nYour household into a hundred and forty five\nOkay and um what are your car's worth\nUm we just recently paid off one of our cars it's worth about Fifteen thousand then the other on the other one more and the other one is about thirty thousand then\nYou have to kind of needed up too much tied up things with\nWheels on them yeah all of the thing now ... now listen all the things with wheels on them go down in value\nYeah and you make a hundred and forty thousand and you've got about eighty five thousand dollars tied up in rolling stock and um it doesn't make sense I mean you're going to get ahead financially as long as you run with that value system um you know\nOfficially went yeah financial piece you never see my husband's around the box I felt I Am actually reading the wind your daughter\nRowan here here's the rule of thumb okay when you buy stuff that goes down in value you don't\nThan she follows me on Twitter [noise]\nDave Ramsey is it okay to accept a job that pays less but has an excellent employee benefits\nNow [noise]\nBecause you are placing\nValue on those benefits that as absurd and you're making your decision using wrong critical thought okay you're assuming that the only way to get excellent benefits and the only way to\nCover the issues that the benefits cover is to take less pay\nWhy don't we go with another option make more money was excellent benefits\n\nBut see everybody is a dumb this down you have to assume the only way I can be happy is make less money the only way I could get securities make less money the only way I could get benefits as make lose money what do you always have to put make less money at the end of the sentences why can't you go I can make more money\nAnd be happy I can make more money and get benefits\nSo you gotta look at it that way to start with ... and make more money\nBut ... it's amazing that people think of the ... there's some kind of a trade off here that's a false it's a false it's a false logic\nWhich is actually an oxymoron but um it's just it's bad critical thinking skills ... no no no no it's not okay okay okay just for that reason it's not okay is there a difference between a psycho score and an experience or Equifax score um\nEquifax has been given a score it said we suck we'd released all of our data to the entire world [laughter] that's the perfect score\nAnd Experian doesn't have a short now I'm ... I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience website doesn't show anything except psycho score on it I don't know maybe they have a program and I'm just not aware of it where they started their own score um or\nMaybe Equifax ... as I don't care and nobody cares what are ... more [noise]\nBut um except their former president who made like a hundred and eighty billion dollars for quitting [noise] uh but uh no I wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of the scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so again it's a set of false logic it's too bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can borrow money this whole thing is about playing kiss he faced with a bang somewhere\nWorshipping at the altar of a false God called fight go psycho is not your provider the only thing psycho will provide you

like when you first started you took it and you were like twenty three twenty four years old and it didn't take you didn't go crazy you didn't do this you waited a lot like six years before you get mad as it did I got you got to ... what made the difference the causes which ...\nI think coming up that it was close to ten years that I was getting closer to what I've been doing this calendar

thousand nine and she does that mean we were twenty six and you were fun yeah and I was doing some stuff and then I was using that credit card that I kept for emergency oh all those emergencies and I\nHave a lot of the classes were candidates I took it again and now I teach it because I mean that you know no you know do I do it\nShorter mobsters you got the information you didn't apply it all before but then just the the fact that it's just not getting anywhere no traction in the decades coming up and the that got you fired up again is that right is that the right answer\nIs and I had to

it's worth it and that you just you have to try new things and it's going to take some time\nUm and then I kind of give them suggestions what works for me one of the main ones that worked for me it was cash and um because within bearable income you can always kind of maneuver that budget money around a little bit and and when it straight when there's cash and at the end of the month and there's

E. F. U. cloth or some of us that are considered uninsured people so are one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not ...\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got 'em that diagnosis removed but I have have that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nOkay no dry out or something you know because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation so that's great news ... hopefully as a short lived issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you gotta look at you or it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough diagnosis for life insurance really tough\nSo um anyway\nThe answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental there would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue\nUm but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidentally up as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't\nYou know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive um but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it might just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so would you have like ten or twenty year term it's run out\nBut I Do you want to seven five and six to ...\nHer joining us America we're glad your ears\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five job is in Los Angeles how Chelsea how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary my my husband is traditionally trip position where they're going to be given him a pay raise but with that pay raise their um say that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay he usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\nSo I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an or former operate yet but when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend to calculate whether the salary rate is comparable with sample the hours because he was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nSounds like it would be simple you been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nCorrect and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the kind that we don't know yet\nShortening the salary as if the salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nYes that makes sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it's just more of a sense where in the ... member cheer mhm um I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery yeah but but the question was the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him\nApples to apples and not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving into management ...\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say like I say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWill we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more\nAnd I'm working in the same number of hours you know and it's like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying but ... but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's a and and he gets paid forty but he's working in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay long term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head towards long term but I'm\nThe you know yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand\nWhat's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUh well right now I'm a I'm a good income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nOr about eleven thousand a student loan debt that it ah that that about six months ago was a lot about Nineteen thousand and I've been working working hard and saved my money and paying it off as much as I can good or bad cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention ...\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future ... and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so I mean it kind of want a young lady of financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have ... and yeah my aspirations [noise] because I'm In the process I've been saving to uh get a VA home loan now is just about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money to the day\nWhen I'm twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up\nA a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today one of them twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes there is a a odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um people getting on their own\nOkay and you've made one\nI made a very um rudimentary proud of the tight mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either the at the end of my rainy day fund started coming into my regular cash flow\nAnd like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do so again Dr jump\nOff my my debt plan more do I have my invention [laughter] okay um\nWell what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between them and you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know you ... what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\nBecause you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited song [laughter] ever be able to sell them you know ... unfair I like trying to ah\nContinue to do it the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give you just let's just make up a pretend example okay he will be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage\nAnd you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works than what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays a deposit with you large enough to build the order\n... and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\nThe thing I should dial down my rather than just an all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nI don't really get much capital on this you've already you already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\n[noise] well I as the person that but I I just see I'm a perfectionist I Want it to be you know a good good like I'm proud of\nThat so now that it's probably lived there on Oprah factions [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap this broken\nYou're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in the switch has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but\nLet's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant in there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got\nBut let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant in there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money\nAnd they're a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket [noise] except your brain power and your sweat\nAnd your smile out there selling it\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground [noise]\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they're going to mass production or something is proven into the marketplace or the actual prototype\nAnd you're talking to a guy's lost money that way the stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live um in in our city\nEighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the

to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families should stay away from cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies in foreclosures\nThat's why I send you to Zander insurance they've been helping my listeners find the right plans at the lowest cost for almost Twenty years called eight hundred three

I\nOur lives have really changed um but right now we're on that baby step to I'm paying off our debt\nWe have paid off thirty thousand dollars and we started in May of this year and good on and we\nAre questioning whether or not to we've had we have our Ross are Ross IRA\nAnd requesting on whether or not to poll from it to pay off one of our debts that we have um it's it's actually a travel

it wouldn't be allowed to you I hear her um we owe twenty seven thousand on it um we're getting ready to make a payment of five grand here at the beginning of November we ... a hundred and forty thousand\nOkay and um what are your cars were\nUm we just recently paid off one of our cars it's worth about Fifteen thousand on the other one word and the other one is about thirty thousand\nUs too many I don't want to be kind of needed up too much try to do things with wheels on them yeah all of that I Know and we all know English and all the things with wheels on them\nGo down in value yeah and you make a hundred and forty thousand and you've got about eighty five thousand dollars tied up in rolling stock and um it doesn't make sense I mean you're going to get ahead financially as long as you run with that value system um you know surely\nOfficially went to the financial piece you never see my husband's read the books and still have I Am actually reading the wind your daughter\nRode ... okay when you buy stuff that goes down in value you don't get rich\nShe follows me on Twitter\nDave Ramsey is it okay to accept a job that pays less\nBut has an excellent employee benefits\nNow [noise]\nBecause you are placing\nValue on those benefits that as absurd and you're making a decision using wrong critical thought okay you're\nAssuming that the only way to get excellent benefits and the only way to cover the issues that the benefits cover is to take less pay why don't we go with another option make more money was excellent benefits\nBut see everybody is a dumb down you have to assume the only way I can be happy\nIs make less money the only way I could get securities make less money the only way I could get benefits is make less money what do you always have to put make less money at the end of the sentences why can't you go\nI can make more money and be happy I can make more money and get benefits\nYou gotta look at it that way to start with ... and make more money but it it's amazing that people think that the yet there's there's some kind of a trade off here it's a false it's a false\nIt's a false logic which is actually actually more on but um it's just it's bad critical thinking skills shot no no no no it's not okay okay okay just for that reason it's not okay is there a difference between the score and an experience or Equifax score a\nEquifax has been given a score it's uh\nPsycho score and an experience or Equifax score ...\nEquifax has been given a score it said we suck weight or least all of our data to the entire world [laughter] that's ... ...\nAnd Experian doesn't have a short now I'm ... I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience ... doesn't show anything except psycho score on it\nNow maybe they have a program and I'm just not aware of it where they started their own score or maybe Equifax ... facts as I don't\nCare and nobody cares what I ... a more [noise]\nBut um except their former president who made like a hundred and eighty billion dollars for a wedding uh but\nUh no I wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of the scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so again it's a set of false logic it's it's bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can borrow money this whole thing is about playing 'cause she faced with a bang somewhere\nWorshipping at the altar of a false God called fight go psycho is not your provider the only thing psycho will provide you

today and it doesn't matter whether you're thirty to forty two or twenty two if you're a mom and you're earning an income and your kids are counting on your income then you would need about ten to twelve times your income on you and yeah it's ... life insurance coverage death\nIn statistically the older you are the more likely you are to die so it gets more expensive\nIt's a pretty simple math formula\nAnd so yeah twenty thirty two is more than twenty two and less than forty two years old uh the the premiums are less so\nBut it's not that expensive to get Fifteen to twenty year level term

Mont but it's near the intersection of McCormick\n... okay uh and then kale has been so busy it's been split into two locations ... and and really it's going to you you you have to look at your voter card to know which part of it has been split into this is\nTrue and everything and uh but but the point is on kale kale remains word is ... about forty to fifty percent of the voters we going to monitor what high school for the biscuit wrong you run precinct precinct and voting location\nThere is still a mother cello precinct and that's going to be in a different part of the ... you got it or resigns will be there okay and then a free bridge use now moved up to the church will free breach days at the ... lodge that all of it as that stays at all okay I'm Sorry I'm being free bridges still preached about\nFifty percent of it will move up to the broadest memorial Baptist church in Fifteen twenty five stony point wrote about half a mile north of where you turn into goat\nAnd again your voter registration card will tell you which one you\nYes exactly if you don't have that there's two of the things you can do go to Virginia or tease me go to elections dot Virginia dot Gov or called registrars office at nine ... ah nine seven two for one seven three\nOkay now I Want to move on does just kind of recapping what we had before crusade talking about what's happening ... area voters\nAs you folks and crows they know you have to places that yeah that you wanted to place you may vote one is at Brownsville and the other is that a cruise a elementary school Brownsville elementary school workers say that ... was so large that we needed to split it\nWe now have a third a voting location which is called the ... river voting location which is at western ... more high school okay so it's right across the lake ... excellent location\nIt's it'll be down in the auxiliary Jim and so again look at your card is failing Nat Cole registrar war if you do have to go to a ... law wrong location they can direct you to the right location\nIf you get your card and it says ... river you know like why the hell is that\nOr if you do happen to go to a ... law wrong location they can direct you to the right location\nSo if you get your card and it says ... river you know like why the hell is that the ... western ... high school in fact the voter court will say that OK Los Angeles and absolutely look very well thought out to uh to do that let us talk a little about\nVoting times if we can voting lines and things\nWell and and this is something that always causes trouble even if in a highly populated a precinct right Peter what's that all the times that people show up to vote\nYes absolutely uh it's it's it it would apply these are county numbers but it applies most specifically to wear a larger precincts and the and the and we looked at last November and basically from the hours of seven AM to noon\nForty eight percent of our voters voted now more county in the five hours from noon to five PM thirty two percent voted\nSo here's what the impact is here with the moral is number one if you have to vote get out and vote early that's great and if you have some flexibility and you can vote afternoon noon to five\nThen what you end up doing is light likely spending a lot less time in\nThe precinct mhm your parking spot and waiting to vote\nPlus you're making it easier for people who don't have the flexibility who have to maybe they work all the way till seven going somebody like me who's got broadcast duties at seven PM and as a write\nIn the rye and and that's very good point is it well planned out you're voting I Know that I bless the people I get the phone calls right at six am I voted I you know we're the polling place was you'll sometimes they're a big line and this could be a big line kind of de\n... in a way six am happy the worst time\nBecause what you've got as you got people get their the quarter of a quarter to six a line is twenty long mhm all takes us a while to get through that first twenty people right because we're we're getting off the go so to speak and so look if if you need to vote early vote early you have some flexibility it works for you and it worked for the folks that voter\nI always vote in the afternoon or once you know obviously my mornings or a little busy um but uh you know once you know to to thirty or so come around them hidden Johnson elementary or you know it is you know and it really is it and you know people kind of got their second wind at that point\nAh anyway yeah so a ... and quickly and I know dark we'll are really kind of runs this whole deal but I saw an email from Georgia urban the other day that was saying might they'll roast so it was also sending one out\nWho ironically will be joining us in about two minutes I'm for it for another subject but was talking about poll watchers a poll volunteers and folks like that and you should contact your local party chairs whoever they may be\nAbsolutely and there are specific rules you need to follow a you know you need to stay outside the forty foot line uh\nYou need that need to make sure that you're not feeding voters going to or from the polling place [noise] um and otherwise have at it but\nYou know what I said there was also you know officials or you know there's training for a full official yet and he's like Ryan\nSide that's right you're allowed to your what's going on your lap and make those people who voted for him to do that you you understand his vote you get out ... haven't voted yet a lot of ... leaves as they still do that\nIs what's going on or what may have boiled over at the Saudi embassy in Turkey a battle for as the Saudi and again this is my poor grasp of this and I want you to help me understand this Saudi Arabia's royal family is basically\nIn charge of the Islamic state or the the ... in Saudi Arabia the royal family is charged with you know the the quote unquote descendants of\nMohammed or and and Erdogan\nWants to lead the caliphate so that means turkey needs to sort of take over that role as the leader of the Islamic world it\nWell then it's a leader there the caretaker of the two holiest sites of mecca Medina so are the ones vying for the leadership along with jihadi groups along with gutter along with Iran right now even though they're they're they're\nA Shia so here's the heart of it all so um there's ... ... ... yeah that must be a a\nEr and be as looking to go and a somewhat bring a Saudi Arabia and the dark ages but he's a bad actor any ... you have to come to grips with the fact that what's the Islamic or any allergy and the Islamic ideology is ...\nBut he's a bad actor any ... you have to come to grips with the fact that what's the Islamic\nAh any allergy and the Islamic ideology is defined in a you can buy English translation and ... of ... of Islamic law right okay that's the best thing 'cause people go with the current

New York city\nAnd about the reaction to it and as you know I'm going to make the case that we don't know at this point who set those devices into the mail and who's responsible for those devices but I can tell you this that the actual political violence that have been carried out in this country over the last several years\nAre almost exclusively from the left\nAnd if you don't like that then called me up and tell me that it was a lefty who shot up Republicans on a baseball field and nearly killed Congressman Steve college telling me that it was somebody from the right who committed the act that ... has been involved in in major American cities\nYou know there's such a long list of the things that have happened in this country or the left has acted in a violent way and we've seen the likes of Maxine Waters members of member of Congress encouraging violence former attorney general and Democrat Eric Holder encouraging acts of political violence\nWe've seen all of those and we've heard their cries even Hillary Clinton most recently and I'll play the sound bite a little bit later on where Hillary Clinton said you cannot be civil when you were opposing what the Republicans are doing to this country\nAnd civility will return when you return political power to the Democratic party in America those are the voices that are calling for violence Eric Holder saying when they go low we kick them\nNow you tell me who's encouraging the political violent and then when you hear about this report that\nPackages were mailed to the Clintons bill and Hillary to the Obamas Michelle in

is only going to return when Democrats are given the reins of power again welcome back to the Lars Larson shows so many reactions today to these devices that have arrived in the mail\nTo George Soros to the Clintons to the Obamas to John Brennan to Debbie Wasserman Schultz and perhaps that was an accident we don't know her name was on the return address\nBut I thought we'd find out more about where these bombs might have come from steamboat choose a visiting fellow at the Davis Institute for foreign policy and national security and a retired army special forces officer and the top Pentagon official\nAs Steve thanks for your service to American uniform and thanks for taking the time denied\nShirt thanks for having me back on the show so tell me this ... do you have do we have any hints ah from what we know today about these these devices that were delivered earlier today and discovered a where they might be coming from or what they might be motivated by\nA well we don't have any idea 'cause we don't have\nYou know the post marks and all that stuff to to look at and and decipher I'll be willing to bet at the FBI and Secret Service are probably\nClosing in on whoever sent these devices because using the mail to do this sort of thing leaves a lot it travels a lot more than most people realize\nAnd you know not everybody is lucky as the Unabomber was stay out there as long as he did uh most of the folks get caught pretty quickly so I I think while we don't know yet seven announced any of it properly uh I think there there probably are\nOn the trail of whoever it is\nI Would expect that's true too and while I'm not an expert on crime scene investigation things like that are over the years I've read too many stories about\nFolks who built explosive devices and they tend to leave all kinds of of evidence inside of them whether it's DNA whether it's fingerprint whether it's just the source of the materials that they're able to track down unless you're very careful as a bomb maker I Would imagine you're going to leave those kinds of hints and clues\nThat might take up and this is clearly going to be the focus of a lot of America as a you know law enforcement\nOr until this is solved a that that I I think you're right they are going to track this back\nTo the person who sent them I'm kind of curious about whether or not you think at this point we can even make an educated guess about what might be motivating and since these devices arrived\nA exclusively at the addresses of of prominent Democrats and liberal politicians in America we initially heard a report the door devices send to the White House that was quickly pulled back\nAnd it was it exclusively the sorrows Clinton's Obama's John Brennan of\nWho I think would probably resist any kind of titled but I think I could call them in a you know a a a tool of the left at this point\nI'm said that because they were sent a Democrat you might think well then the source must have been conservatives but it could also be uh something designed to bring some kind of sympathy or a false flag and I don't ordinarily believe unfolds flags\nBen conservatives but it could also be uh something designed to bring some kind of sympathy or a fold flag and I don't ordinarily believe unfolds flags as we are less than two weeks before an election\n[noise] yeah I I think you're right I mean in the same way that you know when that guy shot up the Republican House\nSoftball teams ... is a it was highly likely that that person who's going to turn out to be somebody who really didn't like Republicans are and as it turned out that was the case or in this case I think of the first to false position is obviously this is somebody who is not particularly enamored\nTo people with strong liberal leanings and or people that are overly critical of President Trump but we can't really make that determination and until we get other corroborating evidence that says that ah you know the fact that not one of these devices\nWent off they were you know all discovered I couldn't tell you maybe they weren't intended to go off maybe this was a false flag we don't know uh you know fortunately looking at the pictures that I've seen is that devices and we're not exactly\nYou know rocket science kind of a formation and it was they were pretty crude\nAs one of my colleagues Jim ... said today that\nThe picture of the passage of the bomb will probably go down in in some FBI class saying this is what a pipe bomb in the mail will look like it was you know that kind of obvious that that there was something there to to\nDo more investigation on but we won't now and we shouldn't really make any can draw any conclusions\nInto law enforcement finishes his investigation and we find out what the real motivation of whoever did this was\nYou know Steve you had the same reaction I did when I saw that sort of crumbled a manila envelope ... and and you know that putting a pipe inside of that before anybody even open to your immediately going to wonder what is very have really\nFeels like a steel pipe inside of an envelope maybe in addition to not intending for them to go off you wanted them to be discovered fairly early whereas I have a couple of boxes sitting on my studio desk right now that are from Amazon Prime I don't even know what's inside of them and occasionally\nMy wife orders and things that are particularly heavy but if they're packed inside a box I don't know what's in there and you can see it from the outside you'd think if somebody wanted a bomb to make itself make its way all the way inside somebody's office packing it that way\nWould would uh you know would actually concealing but if you wanted it to be discovered early on before and we all know the pipe bombs can go off inadvertently maybe would package it exactly that way so that it would be immediately recognized as a suspicious package\n[noise] yeah and they you know one of the things we need to wait for is the you know the FBI\nInvestigation of the device itself because they'll be able to tell a lot from that you know did they intend for it to go off what do they have operated the way they thought it would\nAh or would it be something like that bomb that was in the trunk of the car in times square where the guy started it made a really effective big bombing you know he just fail we couldn't follow the Internet instructions or you know so we'll we'll have to say about that\nAnd then as we talked about the other forensic clues that should be in there the mail you know I'll be honest with you I'm surprised the post office male those things because they're usually pretty good right when you step up to the counter asking all those questions sealing the thing\nThe office male stamps because they're usually pretty good right when you step up to the calendar asking all those questions seal and the thing you know and if you don't give them legitimate answers that gives them a feeling of comfort that they will mail it\nAnd and this kind of looked like something suspicious in the package that made you know hindsight's always twenty twenty so ... we'll see where does but uh it's a little early to draw conclusions\nOr an attached political motivation to it but now it it sure looks like there's some politics involved on one side or the other\nI Would think so too and Steve I've had that same problem when you have to convince the post office it's not a bottle of whiskey or sending to a friend but actually a bottle of olive oil you know if you can't be convincing there they're not they're not going to and neither is FedEx either they won't take it either\nYeah I mean when my son was deployed in Iraq he needed some batteries for his high speed flashlight or that he couldn't get in the low PXs over there and you're not supposed to mail batteries to people so I I'll and this\nMaybe I'm going on now for your pets batteries\nInside a bag of em in there so that you know he could get the batteries they needed you know in combat or and you know you can do it but it it takes some imagination and some\nYou don't know what's inside one of those Amazon boxes and believe me she has ordered some incredibly heavy stuff from time to time and there's and there's also the F word feels like it's a box full of air so ... you know if you wanted to really conceal it\nYou would have concealed it inside a bubble wrap inside a box you would've taped ... you you might have even ... copied some of the markings of a UPS box or an Amazon Prime box\nBut if you like what if you package you did if you went to all that effort to build these things and then packaged did in a way that anybody who picks up a manila envelope that feels like it has a pipe in it and his and immediately suspicious I'd be amazed I think they were designed to be based on the way they look they were designed to be on it\nOr if you look at the end of abs so pay for for terrorism is and the other that's what's in the textbook\nThat are full of is what is the end the textbook really missing is is is is is the cut and paste letters like a ... or ... I'm ... I'm going to get you know that's the only thing that's missing from that do you know I it's textbook\nI saw a comment from a from a cop I Know not not long ago where he said he he was involved in in covering kidnappings in ransoms and things like that for Twenty years he\nNever once a note made up of letters or words cut out of magazines and he says the only place he had ever seen that was in movies and TV that he never actually seen it himself\nSo I kinda wonder we don't want to mix up too much of movies and TV with real life thanks for the call by the way and glad you called in from Alabama to go to Steve in Washington DC welcome to the Lars Larson show\nFact checker I saw a call our so I've got two questions about this whole thing\nThe the why didn't the photos that was ... that were treated out first thing that really ... really is it just makes ice skating all about this ... it\nIs why are they traded out at police have those photos that's the first question and those those photos shouldn't be accessible by the public right now and also\nIf you open up a package and there's a bomb in it\nAre you going to stick around like take a photo of ... bomber you gonna sail\nI'd I'd be walked I'd be stepping away it's the\nSame thing Steve that always amazes me when people say I came home and found the front door my house unlocked and I knew were allotted or broken into and I decided to go in and see what was going on look I'm no coward but I think it would and we wouldn't be sensible to do that\nIf you find your house broken into you step back walk away and called the police and if you find a bomb in your office you step back tell everybody else to leave\nAnd you call the police and you get out of the way and you probably don't fire up your cell phone near the possible bomb you know you you leave and and you're right that it does seem odd that what amounts to evidence would be so quickly disseminated to the public unless of course I mean and\nAnd you're right that it does seem odd that what amounts to evidence would be so quickly disseminated to the public\nUnless of course I mean and ... the same thing that struck me that when Cuomo the governor of New York decided about two or three hours or go to to go out and deploy a hundred National Guard to the streets of New York\nThe part of that that doesn't make sense to me is you're talking about packages arriving in the mail what is a National Guard soldier in uniform a standing at the end of an intersection and he said he's deployed them to positions of infrastructure\nIt's almost like you

does a different kind of talk radio show Clyde Lewis said you didn't actually used the term false flag did you and I said yeah I sure did and here's why\nOrdinarily I've heard people have false flag theories about all kinds of incidents that actually happened\nThis one sounds like an attempt to try to bring sympathy on the Democratic party the Democratic party in the last week or so is already began to signal that they don't think they're going to get the big blue wave in November on the sex\nThey don't even think they're going to get a small blue wave they in may in fact be completely humiliated on election day so what would bring some sympathy to them\nAnything that made it look as though they were under attack from the right\nI think we're going to find out that these pipe bombs

one\nThey're delivered by the u._s. mail and delivering anything by the u._s. mail is going to leave all kinds of trails behind it because you have to put it in a box somewhere you have to take a do postal office somewhere it may have post marks on and you may have noticed that some of the stamps did not have cancellations on them and that's a clue\nThe packages were all taped up and this is one of the things I notice the bombs appear to have lots and lots of electrical tape and the packages had lots of tape if you've talked to people in the police are among the police who ah take a look at

... we always putting ... to the head of the line Paul is on the line and Pennsylvania fabled welcome to the program what's on your mind tonight so\nThank you for being as responsible and not as derogatory as some other people are so I think you'd do a really good job and your logic is a fantastic\nThank you and so there's all that good stuff and I mean you're a pleasure to listen to I don't always agree with you know my point is simply this and I could give you several stations and I hope I have a chance to do that there are quite a few on the extreme\nRight for an example it back in two thousand one of the recount was being done in Florida at a customer my store this at all those Democrats they keep raking in and you know that that stuff and I said yeah I watched\nIt was being done in Florida had a customer my store that said oh those Democrats they keep raking and and you know that that stuff and I said yeah I watch television last night and the door to the county room was bashed in\nAnd came people that were screaming yelling and waving their arms and anger and stop the boats stop the vote and I said oh they were Republicans weren't day and he said eh my point was not that\nThe left us better or the right is better the extremists that woman that held up the the fake separate head of the president I miss disgusted about her as probably any conservative would be and disgusted about the neo Nazis in Virginia that that\nYou know did the the uh the the ranting and raving and there were the the ... for a man drove from California to incite rioting and a woman that was basically walking along\nFall here ... you're trying to run out the clock on me I think now so and unfortunately\nIf if you if you want to go back twenty or Thirty years we could actually go back a hundred and fifty years and say have most of the assassinations and attempted assassination spend the work of liberals and the answer would be yes and I could give you chapter and verse on that if you want to go more recently what we could say is well let's see\nHas Hillary Clinton said you will not get a return to civility\nUntil you give us power back has antifa marched in the streets and they benefit the left have we seen black lives matter commit acts\nOf violence ... trying to burn hold towns down guns have been fired people have been heard uh and that is the lens and then you've got to occupy and they have been you know both gross and disgusting and violent as well over the years all of those things are coming from the left\nAnd all I Would like it and you know Steve ... very nearly died because of a left wing Bernie Sanders supporter a who was a lefty who was angry and decided to shoot a bunch of Republicans\nHand you've seen people like Eric Holder encourage violence Maxine Waters encourage violence Hillary as I said his courage violence\nSo you know when you tell me oh there's a little bit on both sides I hear that kind of moral equivalency from reporters who don't have the guts to say one side has identified itself with violent protest far more than the other side\nMost ... in fact when Republicans call me or conservatives called me and they say\nHey let's go out and have a protest unless yell and scream and you know carry signs and and and all that I say that's that's not the way conservatives act we are conservative where I live on the left does to they'll go out and you know remember the day after the inauguration the big women's march\nWhere vehicles are set on fire people were assaulted bad things happen to have you ever seen\nConservatives in America do that now I'm not going to say there aren't individual conservatives who will throw upon news or maybe try and push down a door but I'm saying for the most part the big protests of conservatives like Tea Party protests\nAre peaceful there well ordered and they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived whereas when the left shows up you can usually count on broken windows people assaulted\nAnd you saw all the assaults on Donald Trump supporters through the entire campaign when people would show up in an event there was not their event they would they were there not to listen and maybe pick apart what the candidate was saying I think that's legitimate I go to liberal or you know speeches on occasion so that I couldn't hear what they're saying\nBut I don't see the kind of behavior by conservatives that I see that comes from the left do you\nSee any examples of that like what does it what did the president who am I ...\nThat comes from the left\nDo you see any examples of that like what does it what did the president who am I ... a month ago he said several things during the campaign police don't be so so kind to the president's ... their heads and you put them in a said\nOil ... exactly but Paul at some point words are turned into actions or they're not you you and then I Know that that is true in both sides there are people who say that guy makes me so mad I Want to kill him have you ever heard of a friend of yours say that\nYes someone I and have they ever killed anyone your friends you know\nSo there are so here's the difference there is a wide difference usually between what people say and what people actually do but when people actually do those things when they show up at political rallies\nAnd said this isn't even my rally it's not my candidate I'm going to show up and I'm going to disrupt it so that nobody can speak and by the way\nWhen you see hearings on Capitol Hill and the left doesn't like what's going on in the hearing they show up and tried to disrupt the event do you see conservatives doing that\n[noise] um I I think if you if if you're willing to do it get the Southern Poverty law ads\nThat bond that bungee is morally bankrupt and they don't tell the truth they might have at one point\nOut that what evidence do you out of\nThat well because I've seen and I know some of the groups I've covered some of the groups that they have labeled as hate groups they've labeled as hate groups any group that doesn't agree with them politically which is very it's\nA kind of political bigotry it's the kind of thing that if you're at work and there's a guy at work you don't like and he said he has the best idea you've ever heard it or your bonds ever hurting his life and you say that guy's fat\nOr that guy staying where he doesn't take a shower or you know or you know his ... you know he smells like arm peddle all the ... and you say well what about his idea oh it doesn't matter he's fat\n... ... it's the political bigotry where you say none of those the ideas coming from that person or any good\nI'm telling you that when I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see one where conservatives show up and they say oh we don't we don't like the content of this hearing so we're going to disrupt it that is almost exclusively an activity of the left\nAnd the protests the mass protests from the women's march to the Occupy to black lives matter to antifa are all from the left there usually all potentially violent some kind some cases actually violent people get hurt things get burned down things get broken you\nCan't pry into this conservative incidence of the same time Kenya\nWell of the neo Nazis identified with the right and the skin\nNeal listen you gotta remember you don't want to not see is that the national socialist party it was invented by Adolf Hitler you know and and yet but it wasn't stores listed\nAll yeah yes it was if you took a look at Germany's economy it was very much socialist they said the states controls everything and you will produce for the state and you will be subsumed by the state if the state\nTells you when you're ... if it is socialism is\nThe ownership and I say this socialism is the ownership of the means of production\nThat's out of a shot of a college textbook real socialism can only be done to the point of a gun if you go to somebody and say hey by the way you made a lot of money this month but this guy over here didn't make much\nBelieves that would be a good thing to cover\nYou know Americans said every American citizen depending and don't you know regardless of their income for health\nFor health expenditures for you know major health problems that they might have I think most Americans believe that\nBut and and most people say well you have a system to provide the benefits to them but Americans don't want to give up their own health insurance you know Ninety percent of us have health insurance we all want to you know will and Arnold plant you know so that ... percent or don't have healthcare get it just came to the health care voucher and let him go out and shop for health care\nYou know that's the way I feel that the interests of you know you mentioned the veterans plant\nYou I experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me you know I get good health\nCoverage from the VA hospital we at Walter Reed right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world but other veterans say I get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they vote another hospital\nWell I'm a choice guy that the Democrats don't believe in choice they believe that forcing you into the health care that they want to give you\nI'm a choice guy that the Democrats don't believe in choice they believe that forcing you into the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal I Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do while still living now here's what I Do in place\nSteve to pieces first of all let's deal with a preexisting condition crowd which is about somewhere between two hundred thousand and maybe a high end of four hundred thousand people because we know those numbers because of the people who signed up for Obamacare with preexisting conditions when they wiped out all the risk bowls\nSo those two hundred thousand people could be covered as I understand the numbers for maybe ten Fifteen billion dollars out of a or a thousand\nBillion dollar federal budget like saying four thousand billion while they were saying if you made four thousand bucks a month could you afford Fifteen bucks for this black people would say or Ford's out you know forty thousand bucks a year could you afford a hundred and fifty dollars for this just to make the math easy\nThen I go sure so that's part one just cover everybody with a preexisting condition that who has\n... let's say wealth blow up a million bucks or half a million bucks and ... below I don't know a hundred thousand dollars yeah if you're over a hundred thousand you got to take care of yourself second\nI'd like to do is have the government say we will ... define what a good catastrophic plan is because this is the second group does all of us you have to realize I get hit by a truck\nAnd or you know I get hit by heart attack and I need a hundred and fifty thousand dollar operation if I don't have health care and I do\nUm then I Need to have that bypass covered or the trans fat and covered or whatever your kid needs a new kidney okay we'll take care of it but we'll take care of it by saying we will offer a catastrophic plan for those people who want to go up ... actively bear they're not going to have any insurance except catastrophic\nAnd they say it's like you know the having having a a collusion insurance\nOn our homeowner's insurance homeowner's insurance in case you say and burns down and I know is she\nEven on homeowners I'd bump my deductible from a thousand five thousand because they said why my wife said well why are you well for house burned down\nThen we have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burned down you know five thousand bucks but the the chance of that is very low and the savings by going to that it gives you a really low premium so\nYou do those two things but you don't have the government provided you say to the insurance industry develop this product and if you meet the criteria so we can tell people it has the good housekeeping into Donald Trump seal of approval on and\nThen pick from one of the news and the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally could get the premiums like that couldn't way\nYeah I mean think about it this way whatever they said you know all the palaces the best restaurants in the fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nFaster I certainly don't need those are family ties with you know every and just go to McDonalds well first of all what do you think would happen to the quality of food it as an adult that they hit ... right that's the logic\nOn healthcare incidentally you know the Medicare I don't have to remind you this but some of your listeners may need to be reminded Medicare is now facing something like\nThirty trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities so we're really for every kid anyways it's like putting every American under that that that they had it right I mean you know it's already gone bankrupt and working for other a hundred and fifty million people I knew it\nNo it makes no sense whatsoever Steve it is a pleasure to have you on the program always and congratulations and I should give credit to Dr Laffer although I think sometimes the short change a ... sort of changes Arthur because he figures laugh or add the Laffer curve you already got all the attention\nFor although I think sometimes Steve shortchange ... short changes Arthur because he figures
