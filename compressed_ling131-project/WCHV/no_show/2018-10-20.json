Greer ones than others and and they have these things and engineered actually\nAs to where you take a a a flat trial and you swirl it's real surround yeah and not so much swirling circles but you just and you basically flat and it out but the uh grains in the texture of the material\nWill form a very predictable pattern all be it you know somewhat random they'll seem very random but it's still smooth and a little bit of is hard to describe but I Do share your ah your you know passion for having some texture on the walls I think it's interesting as well\nYou know and it makes it it makes it look more solid than just the plain smooth wall which your uh your success on that is that nobody notices anything\nYeah yeah yeah it's totally ... and when I first saw a plane smooth as well I thought it was wallpaper or you know right right\nAnd I like even take their and within drywall so you've got the\nThe staples ceiling if you will which is a which is the one where you have a heavy batch of mud and then you sort of push a I'm\nA trial I think it's more of a hawk which has got a a handle in the middle and it's about a foot and a half square flat nice of metal and you you put that up against and you can either give it a little twist or just give it simply a poll and when you pull it down and has these like ... tight\nAs much I mean yeah but they're there but people like that does go step off then there's the popcorn ceiling that's an old wanted everybody shaves off nowadays right exactly right how could I get rid of all people want to get rid of this simple feeling as well and then you've got the one with the world\nThat is just absolutely impossible to patch you know you'll never get that\nDone yeah we we they house that we had in Texas has a slap brush texture on the ceilings ah and it was fairly common when the house was built but nobody knew how to do it again in ... when we were doing the remodeling on that house so we had to learn how to do the slap brush and he got very good at it the um the\nUh home stores in the area had what they call the ... brush\nBut it was way too big for the ... the size of Cyprus that we needed the slight brush that we needed was about six inch diameter\nAnd it it looks like a brush my mistaken in this that has that has ruined his life flattened out yeah this is the flag is the bristles are going on in all directions do yeah the\n... are made out of the corn has or something and it looks like you know corn has fibers\nOr go in all directions to\nMedicines are made out of the corn has or something that looks like you know corn has fibers in it but uh so now I've found those things on line but at the time I couldn't find a six inch diameter ... anywhere so I took a one of the crows and cut it into two and\nThen in the old days when you had to drive from store to store to store you know I mean you certainly could call but you're not going to get anywhere like do you I don't know if you guys I think they've closed as it is very sad but pleasant hardware in Richmond you remember that maybe they're still they're opening for us oh come on anyway that was\nA you know before anything was on line that was the place where if you couldn't find it anywhere else you could find it there and it was a very large hardware stores right unbridled aggression hardware store pretty much yeah and I had to wait\nFor pressure cookers that haven't been made in forty years\nProbably I mean we even have that here in Charlottesville and it was a restaurant called the hardware store a dad downtown and I can remember when it actually was a hardware store a prior to\nThe downtown ball being done and everything being but it was a that was like pleasant they had every thing or even a a plates and a silverware such flowering just just everything in there and ...\nWe I absolutely sleds you know will they feel you know you can go to the I think a Martin says one of our last a real family owned hardware stores here in Charlottesville and they still have a lot of really neat stuff in there they do uh but anyway yeah now\nWe're so spoiled because you know to find the brush that you're speaking of what was called a flap brush ... it's a slap brush flat brush and and yeah you just go I'd probably just the Amazon or anywhere\nWell actually carry them nowadays in those they do they do now I see I see I had to make our own now they have 'em now they're the here\nThem but it's actually I've seen a structures here that have the same uh Sixth Sense yeah ... ... texture on them\nAnd you're saying the last of the family and we got better living and you know that is definitely a family owned but it's a little bit more of a building supply than just a hardware store or you know and and they have lots and lots of

you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr pick is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural and alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract day and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right as a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy now and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night\nAnd how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in\nYou and your drink is cut down this great absorption\nRate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nRight and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for now ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd I want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call the shirt and mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free

just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for and remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael ... is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the sciences or little trips a little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles need them actually helps the transmitters and the nerve\nAnd when you take this complex formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I ... a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back mhm and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period\nAnd it it completely alleviated the problem now what about heart disease\nHeart disease is uh something you have to watch out for both dietary early and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body to be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I ... for the next week\nJust about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming\nAnd I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough he was the one who took a week of ah the formula that ... formula and um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer may take it out to her friends\nAnd that's amazing and when I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using this before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system well so the very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because it's deficient in many of them\nIs also blocking further absorption\nSomething it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose\nFolks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight one for\n... is a unique blend of

CEO and founder of age wave\nWhich code develop this study with Merrill Lynch\nCan tell us what's your research showed as to how much support parents are giving their kids annually now\nWell ... we've always known the parents you know support and provide a lot of care and love and financial backup to children toddlers I mean that's just considered sort of normal that's just part of the exercise but\nWhen we saw how much that was calculated to be back in the Nineteen sixties the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen was twenty five thousand dollars\nToday the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen is two hundred and thirty thousand dollars which is a lot you know\nBut the real shocker came when we went beyond the Eighteen year olds there's been a lot of talk Chris the last ... years about boomerang kids and the idea that it's twenty five or thirty year old\nBecause of the high cost of rental housing and paying down college debts and you know inability to kind of get launched a lot of those kids are living with their parents and we found that indeed that is true\nThirty one percent of all Americans between the ages of Eighteen and thirty four are living with their parents which is the most common living arrangement among early adult more people do that they live with a spouse\nRoommates or by themself but what really knocked us out of our seats was we began to calculate beyond that you know having your child sort of in your house and you're providing\nGroceries and maybe letting them watch your Netflix we found out that there were five hundred billion dollars in addition spent by parents on their adult children subsidizing their cell phone bills\nRental costs helping to pay down debt\nSending modifications which turned out to be twice as much as what those very same people were putting into their retirement accounts which was two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year\nYeah I was going to ask about how that compares to the retirement numbers so it seems like a lot of parents may be sacrificing their retirement years to keep their kids going\nSince a study launched some of the reflections are hey what what those kids do they even realize that they're taking so much from their parents other people have said hey you know what\nParents seem to like it it's sort of you know the next stage of the helicopter and hovering wanting your kids to be competitive to live comfortably to be happy to get the best shot at a good life\nBut the concern is that those very same well intentioned parents and maybe even well intentioned kids could be jeopardizing their own retirement security\nBecause if you have on average seven thousand dollars a year or going out to each child throughout their young adult years that's a lot of money and many of those very same people can't even afford their own\nBills and their own retirement savings building that nest eggs so to take so much of their resources\nAnd continue to support their kids is warranted discussion\nWe're talking with Ken ... CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of money is that parents\n... CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids we're talking about millennials kids here I think what age range or the parents who are contributing all this money or these boomers primarily or younger\nIf we're looking at what are called early adults what's your Eighteenth thirty four year olds that side of the Census Bureau and sociologist categorize that the parents are going to range anywhere from forty to about Seventy\nSo they're boomers and Gen x ers often in the peak of earning years of their lives so they might be feeling kinda flush\nBut on the other hand we know that about half of those people have almost nothing save for their own retirement\nSo it may be short sighted for so many people and by the way Ninety two percent crash of parents are providing some ... of the early adult children so it's not just middle income it's not just high net worth it's not people who are modestly resource it's kind of everyone\nThis has become the new normal and we have never before in American history and maybe world history\nSeen a situation like this I Know I was born in Nineteen fifty one I was growing up when you turn Eighteen or twenty or\nGraduated school you're pretty much on your own right and in fact if you ask for money a handout from your parents I was something you were a little bit ashamed of and you work in a live at home with your parents 'cause our parachuting today\nIt's become quite normal and it's hard to know if these parents are powering their kids by helping them out or if they say and ...\nAnd therefore weakening them but this discussion is got to be had this is a new phenomenon these young people are taking a little bit longer to get launched and their parents had generously are trying to help them along the way\nBut they may not be able to really afford it\nCan't why do you see millennials struggling to launch you know their own lives is it because of student loans or is it the cost of living in the rent cost in major cities is there a single factor there\nI think there's a few forces one of them is that back in the Nineteen sixties the cost of a public college was about five hundred dollars per year for tuition doubts about ten thousand\nCosts for a private college back then was about three thousand dollars a year now it averages thirty five thousand dollars a year we've been worried about the cost of automobiles or gasoline going up but there's been no big outcry over the fact that tuition for colleges has just been skyrocketing\nAnd so for a lot of young people who want to get ahead they have to take out loans by the way more girls take out loans and boys because more\nYoung women are graduating college than guys are so that's number one very expensive number to those college loans can be three four hundred dollars a month every month on top of that bourbon environments housing it's become extremely expensive\nAnd so here you've got these twenty five and thirty year olds who are straddled often with college debt\nThe other thing that's happening with these young people is that they actually get along really great with their parents\nBack for example an earlier era there might have been one TV set and there are few telephone so people kind of how to share if they lived in a home now a young person can live with their mom and dad's home maybe help with the chores they can go in their own room and watch Netflix if that's what they like and they come and go as they please\nSo it's become more accepting and acceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents said they kinda liked to help out\nFor more accepting unacceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kinda like to help out that may be just as big a challenges weaning them off of this idea of continually helping their kids\nAs it is a challenge to have these kids kind of get their umbilical cords cut and get out on their own\nDo you have any advice for parents who might be listening who are thinking hey maybe I Do need to cut back is there an easy way to do that\nI think it's a series of discussions first of all I think if it's a single parent or there's a couple parents\nTo stop and say oh this heard this program let me make sure I understand what's going on here are we doing that or yeah we are can we afford to\nAnd women is the exit strategy you're going to come into play we talked to young people in focus groups and they said well yeah parents pay your phone bills in your health bill in your car insurance that's just what parents do so they didn't think that they were being mean by asking for that they start that's part of the parent project\nSo to answer your question I think parents need to think seriously and responsibly about what they can afford it they don't ultimately wind up in trouble financially and having to be a burden on those very same kid this\nThat they're trying to be so kind to and there needs to be discussions between the generations\nOn top of that in our study Ninety percent agreed that financial education should be taught at high school a lot of the parents were saying you know\nWe've tried to teach our kids were not even exactly sure how to teach them in this modern age\nAnd social media is having a big impact on them there needs to be some standard basic level of financial education so people can learn about managing debt and the value of compounding and living within your means\nWhich is no longer that certain out there in our lives so\nA combination of taking stock drawing boundaries not just cutting your kids off tonight but developing sort of a game plan so that in one year or in three years and making sure the kids get that and then being sure that they've got the financial education to be able to make wise decisions\nCan die called CEO and founder of

Vance anyway is\nFor you sprinkle it on and then you have to get rain real quick or water it and that kills the bloggers\nIt's called ... Vance anyway it's\nFor your sprinkling on and then you have to get rain real quick or water it and that killed among others\n[laughter] right yeah it's it grubs can be can do a tremendous amount of damage in the in the turf and and uh [noise]\nWe probably don't talk about 'em as much as we as we should we haven't seen as much damage from from rubs the last few years as we had uh several years ago just because we've had fairly dry summers which makes it hard for the the grubs\nTo get a fabulous in and going when the insects a lay their eggs and that's probably why I have\nMore this year than than on other years when it's been dry\nYeah who knows what this wet weather that we've had the the the um eggs for those those grubs have had it easier chance to um you know ...\nOut and and get established down there so\nWe're going to see a lot more grub damage I think you know going into this fall in the next spring and there were also unfortunately going to see a lot more Japanese beetles next summer as well\nYeah they seem to be periodic out there the Japanese beetles\nWell there's a lot of their their um\nPopulation levels depend on how moist the the the weather is an hog oh God what it is yeah if we've got what voice soil and in August\nI'm it's easy for those uh eggs to to hatch and and take off their this sounds weird but they're literally a semi de hydrated when they're when they're laid by the adult Japanese beetle\nSo requires moisture there in the soil they have to actually absorbs moisture out of the soil\nIn order to be to to be viable and and hatch out into the into the grubs so we have really dry weather in August and the soil and your lawn is really dry than those beetles rubs have a hard time or eat ... eggs have a hard time hatching and grown into grubs with\nThis wet weather that we've had this year I Would suspect that we're going to see a lot more beetles um\nI thought that because some years older brother and some you know just a few this year I thought maybe there was something like this gated come around every seven years or something like that are so many years evidently not having to learn about that moisture variants\nYeah so it's like you say you know ... we saw the\nPopulations really drop off um you know several years ago we had those really really dry summers are almost no Japanese beetle activity at all but uh we saw the last couple of years has kind of been ramping up and in this year\nI Would suspect that we're going to you know that the the ... very active and the next spring we're going to see a lot of them\nWill be well advised now\n[laughter] yeah and one of the one of the great things as you can do to help with the you know the damage from the the adult beetles next spring and summer is to use a a grub treatment in your lawn especially if you're seeing those those um those dead patches\nGet that foliage accent and in contrast all through this the winter season and uh they just do fantastic mixes it was pansies and you know some evergreen shrubs in there the the dark greens and they just look incredible in containers\nIf you'd like to join our conversation the phone lines are open again at nine six for one zero seven five again the phone lines are open if you have any gardening questions anything you'd like to discuss any problems you're you're having\nAt your home or in your garden and your landscape with your lawn drainage or any hearts gave our landscaping questions our number here is nine six for one zero seven five\nI'll tell you what if you want to find out if you have a deer problem\nPlus in panties out right plus I'm paying these out and see how quickly the deer discover them and come to munching mingle on them you will know very quickly his you will if you have deer I've got a question I planted I've got deer\nUp the yang out of my house that either don't let us thirty or forty than how it in the corner like fifty to sixty this year you know um I put some ... out which dear\nThat's on their buffet list ... but it was a ... a ... and they haven't touched them and they've been there for like six weeks\nThey usually they don't I've never known to really care OK way or the other\nAnd they've been there for like six weeks they usually they don't I've never known to really care okay and where the other\nI didn't know whether they didn't like the ... the Italian ... [laughter]\nBut I just I'm just curious to yeah yeah they haven't touched them again eight maybe that's just because they've got an eighty eight or cornfield in front of the house and their contends with eating that so um yeah so I'll keep an eye on those but I've just been astonished I I wanted some ground cover around this little Kramer and all that I had and I\nAnd I really want to yeah I'd I loved the look at us for cotton and uh\nAnd anyway so there's there's still hanging on so I'll report back to let you know how they're doing once we get through January and February to see if the if there are still a a untouched but uh yeah I've been pleasantly surprised so far\nWith with deer and just\nBe aware that they're out and moving around right now so it was yeah or the you know the the ah evening hours and it's yeah it's going down which is going to be earlier and earlier here in another week\nYeah transition over into yeah to um the standard time instead of daylight savings time and then and then that that\nKind of dawn period and early in the morning ... they're going to be out and moving around so you want to be careful as your as your out driving with the er the cooler temperatures and\nSeason coming in and mhm hunting season not long\nAfter that yeah for\nSome of the ... some of the hunting hunting seasons already in both seasons and uh and black powder I'm sure as in another week or so out of and then her too yeah and then a rifle season comes in a run around Thanksgiving or so\nAt MIT thinks mid November So with all of that going on here much more active they are going to be moving around you're going to see 'em a lot more on the on the road\nAnd what it is this is also the kind of that time of year when they're they're rubbing their handlers correct like that's\nProbably it has happened in my now ... or ... or ... finishing up but if you've got young trees that you plan and you've got a lot of deer pressure it's a really good idea to put a some kind of physical barrier around one of those trees because you\nGet a a tree that's a typical planting size right and that's perfect for the dear to go into the box\nThey have that that velvet it's been growing on their on their antlers all summer long and they're at that time of year when that bill that wants to come off and issues like crazy ... and they're looking for some place to rub that that velvet off and those trees are the perfect size\nFor them to to get in there and rub that that they'll get an awful\nAnd I've seen them completely destroyed trees I mean not only rubbing the the bark off but I mean thrashing mangled and break go you know those smaller tender trees were talking about and not just\nDeciduous upright trees I've seen them through trash Leyland snipers in our ... and kept him area and just get in there and just destroy those trees\nAnd so like you know what I'm saying we may be on the on the tail end of that or this year um but again just mindful of next year and they're so might maybe some of that going on I I've seen several walk out or and most of them are are are that they're full antlers hard enough and\nAnd um that they'll of it a is a layers gone but uh just something to be a mindful of as we hadn't uh to you know future future years with with any new tenor trees that you plant\nHe'd like to join our conversation the phone lines are open\n... or he is ... he's he's he's ready to take your phone calls and nine six for one zero seven five average in the studio with us this morning and uh he's bringing a olive\nYeah he's he's he's ready to take your phone calls and nine six for one zero seven five average in the studio with us this morning and uh he's uh bringing a all of our callers onto the air and or he'd be happy to take your call again nine six for one zero seven five\nAnd a couple of things to to be thinking about right now in is we as we transitioned into the cooler weather\nWe've had some some frost advisories there I saw some frost yesterday morning\nIf you still have your house plants outside you want to make sure that you're sure transitioning those into the house now is what these these cold temperatures especially\nTomorrow night into Monday morning it's going to be down into the low thirties or possibly even you know down to thirty so\nMake sure that\nThat uh you've got those house plants brought into the house because it it will kill him\nAnd his you're bringing them in you know to make sure that you you spray him so that the any insects that are on those plants or they'll come in with them while they're outside the the wind and rain and and other things that are out there in the environment help to keep those pests under control\nBut once you bring them in the house all of those factors aren't there anymore and it's easy for those those insects to just take off and go crazy\nSo you want to spur spray and with a a a house plant insecticide before you bring them in the house something like a a pie Richard Bass spray does a great job and uh you'll be able to to really minimize the amount of insects that you bring into the house with you\nIt's funny we were getting ready for school ah when I was it was Thursday night and I went into Lincoln's room Lincoln I went into Lincoln dream I get and I said link and guess what he said what I said we're under a frost advisory\nAnd he said yeah you know school [laughter] and I said well buddy not not for profit advisory but we but we are entering the no school season so well beyond will be on the lookout for school cancellations\nA and they had an impending ah weeks and months to come on let's get a phone lines we've got a caller on the line good morning mark we'd like to welcome you to the ... garden show\nHey there how are you today are we so they're\nNow there is yeah\nHey there you can years mark yet and I can hear you now hey good to go\nGreat their wife or added that the owners springtime and I can't have too many on the ground for her to make her happy or four times a year yeah a lot of routes that they don't ... what about\nThe ... oh what can I Do too I helped them in the future [noise]\nGreat question what are the things that [noise] excuse me one of the things that happens with daffodils\nAs they mature and you know been in the ground for years and years and thriving do really really well they they become kind of overcrowded\nAnd are competing for water and nutrient and all that kind of thing and when they're ... they're really tight they tend not to blue very well\nOK so a couple of things that you

thousand perhaps even more well the president came out this morning and threatened to shut down the U.S Mexico border he says he might just send the military there he says that several Central American countries are allowing many criminals to head to the United states\nThe president was referring to the caravan of migrants I Know\nThe Associated Press on AOL and all those other news organizations they called them migrants well the fact is there are people who are planning to enter this country illegally\nIf they actually went to a border crossing and said I'd like to claim

of a new book the politically incorrect guide immigration John welcome back\nThanks good to be on\nBy the way you're going to add an addendum to the politically incorrect guide the immigration to cover the refugee caravans would have now become all the rage\nWell you know we do cover the refugee issue or in the book and how you know if someone passes through a a safe country they're not a refugee anymore so if you if you are being persecuted\nIn Honduras the mommy you get to Mexico where the governments are persecuting you you're not a refugee anymore you have no right to enter the United states and I was relieved to start enforcing that\nWell and aren't you glad that the Trump decided a because it to you know he's actually going by the laws that are already on the books but as I understand it it was the Obama administration and said oh when it comes to persecution we're going to include economics and gangs and crime and things like that that weren't covered I went along going it\nOh yeah and discrimination against transgender and domestic violence basically the whole Islamic world would have the right to come here because they could all claim that they live under an oppressive religion by our standards\n... law that that fits the definition runway but why do why are so many people around this country focused on this this race between Ted Cruz and uh I didn't know is actual name Robert Francis or otherwise known as bad\nAs I Know yeah and you can call me one [laughter] because I have as much Hispanic\nHeritage is as Robert Francis Rourke though there is that on my story at the same I've got a great picture in an address back to when he was in a pipe that so uh I've been calling in beta made a male or work um I I think the national Democrats\nAre obsessed with this they would love to take the state of Texas and the last time they had what they thought was the winning candidate Wendy Davis are minors yet yeah she ... abortion Barbie um she got obliterate it but she got a job and the board of Planned Parenthood\nAnd that's what I think they don't work is really running for he's running for a star star position on the national left even though he can't win an election in Texas\nMean he could win you know he's a congressional seat in a very highly democratic district but\nUm I I think but it's an ... I'm delighted\nThat Democrats have poured thirty eight million dollars into the race and works as he will not share it with other candidates so that's money that could have gone much more competitive races in places like North Dakota\nSo um I think it's it's crucial for America's safety that the Republicans keep both houses of Congress so that the ... the house of representatives doesn't become a nonstop impeachment show trial\nBut um I I don't think a cruise is going to lose to to Iraq I think part of the reason the polls showed cruises vulnerable for a while was because the bad blood from the presidential race\nI was a crew supporter through the convention my girlfriend\nHated what he did at the convention I kind of liked it I rallied to ... you know during the general election but still they're still bad blood 'cause there's a lot of support for Trump in Texas and a lot of people were irritated with\nHis dog it fight against the president I don't agree with that but you know that was one of the things depressing truth cruises support Trump has come to Texas and done rallies that it's cruise\nI don't agree with that but you know that was one of the thing is suppressing ... cruises support Trump has come to Texas and done rallies that Cruz has worked well with President Trump it's funny in the last debate\nOr work was trying to run away from the rest of the Democratic party is talking about how he could work with the president uh you know he's worked with with Republicans in Congress but his saying that he could work with Trump better than cruise cruise pointed out you'll have called for President Trump's impeachment\nDoes not mean somebody that that Donald Trump is going to go with\nThat I mean ... if if he were elected in Texas it'd be like we didn't have a senator senator had died and we just decided to leave the seat open because that's how little impact you would have\nLooked on the other hand drawn is his real name just a twenty twenty as though I mean we've seen people sort of short changed the\nThe process I've always thought that a lot of people had to go through to become president\nYou expected them to perhaps run for the house for the Senate maybe become a governor run a state for a while get some real experience we saw Obama short cut that by saying oh I don't doubt that\nI can be in the state legislature in Illinois I'll hop right to the Senate all immediately start running for president I'll spend very little time and accomplish almost nothing in the Senate never having run a big organization of any kind\nNever signed the front of a paycheck\nThese short cut all that is Beto O'Rourke thinking well run for Senate or get some named ... a raise a bunch of money and then in twenty twenty all run on my good looks and charm\n[noise] yeah I think you know somebody to sit down with Robert Francis at work and say just because you drive a truck is he ... he had an accident does it make you a Kennedy\n[laughter] that is a great line I Hope I Hope you've already said that one out\nBut now it's all auditioning for for your\nAudience I Know I Want you to put that went on Twitter because I'm so tempted by the feeling that if you don't put an interview like I'm going to put it on Twitter and\nI'll hear one I already have in the article was twenty eight million dollars my hope is that recent refugee from New York City to to to Dallas I Hope he uses that twenty million to pay for her to the rest of his life so we never had to drive again that will make me feel safer on the road\nNo kidding well I just I I look at this and I understand that there were people who said that the slam on Trump was well this guy's just a reality stars won't know he's not\nBecause in addition to having a very popular TV show he actually did a lot of things in business and they say oh you know the only turn you know even if you took his worst critic for New York times and said he inherited a lot of property from his dad Gregg\nJohn I Wish somebody like you would write the piece that says\nHow many people in America have inherited a million bucks from their parents I didn't uh but how many of ... million or ten million or a hundred million and they have quickly turned it into half that amount or attempt of that we have to ... go ahead\nI I Know I Know someone who is one of the ranch great grandchildren of John the Rockefeller area is telling me about going to Rockefeller family gatherings\nAnd he says like forty percent of them don't even have jobs\nThey just sort of a dinner around going to fundraisers and ... and then they take their private jets to environmental events to save the planet and [laughter] you know Trump needs something he he he ... he ... he didn't get lemons he got apples but he ... he made the apples and suicide or factory created lots of job\nYou know ... and look he's done a great dog and the American economy is doing great on foreign policy\nMaybe apple cider factory created lots of job yeah look he's done a great job and the American economy is doing great on foreign policy is a lot better president than I ever thought he would be when I was cheering for Ted\nCruz I Know and I always back Trump but I ... I've said to people we all say well he only made a few billion dollars I said that's very hard to do ask anybody who's at the heritage giant amount of money how hard it is to turn into a really large amount of money\nAnd I said and then go back and ask yourself if you inherited a modest some by comparison from say you inherited fifty million dollars\nAnd you went down to your best and financial advisors said well we're going to do with this and he said well fifty million times five four or five percent\nYou can sit back and collect two and a half million dollars a year you know two hundred thousand dollars a month\nAnd you'll never put your money at risk and you can sit on the beach with two fifty thousand dollars a week you could check into the nicest hotel in ...\nAnd sit there for the rest of your life or a hop on a plane every week and go somewhere else and you can do that and Donald Trump didn't do that he didn't say I'm going to take all this money and I'm going to camp on the beach and have parties and\nUh and I try to get some government assistance you know I I don't I'm not ashamed\nOf it you make a teen and are your girlfriend makes sixteen you said\nAbout yeah about she works in the restaurant industry says she gets tips too you know like she she makes minimum wage plus tips\nRight so she's making maybe thirty thousand a year and you're making about thirty ... so you're making seven sixty five Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\n[noise] close to it about you know a little less than that but yeah\nOkay well it I guess but you want your fellow you know X payer hold on you want your fellow taxpayers to help you pay your bills\nWhy well well here's a here's where it is you know I'm paying all my bills\nI'm not I don't have any like extra curricular things I'm spending money on doing the average life\nYou know I Try to get a car payment I got I got into that all paying you know but why\nWhy do you think that the moral for you to ask your fellow taxpayers to to help pay your bills why don't how 'bout this make\nMore money how can they are paying how come how come capable of working get solved and I don't want I Am working ... or the the looming around\nI'm the first guy you're going to talk to who's going to say if somebody is able bodied and of working age they need to have a job and we need to start having these work requirements that the president is pushing their Kris Kobach is pushing it in Kansas\nWe need to have people in office who will say if you're capable of working and they're seven million open jobs you need to go get one of them and if you can't live within the paycheck yearning now\nI've got two suggestions either reduce your spending or increase your work activities find something you can do where your work is worth more\nSo and and that's almost every I can you name me a job anywhere in America that were somebody cannot learn how to do an additional skill that makes them worth another two or five or ten dollars an hour named the job well does pot\nI couldn't I couldn't and and I I mostly agree with you I used to work two jobs I've been known to have two and three jobs my whole entire life me too we got kids now\nWe've got kids now and ah I don't I'm not really a big avid fan of you know kids going to ... to they're they're really expensive uh nowadays there they ... want how much I'm making an hour\nOkay I I got out and can I Do is let me do a test with you here's an idea yeah live next to people there are other people in your neighborhood right\nA\nOkay how about that on tonight when you get home from work or tomorrow when you're off go around and knock on doors in the neighborhood and say I don't make enough money to live the way I'd like to live would you give me a thousand bucks and and maybe even make it easy to give me a thousand bucks this year would you give me eighty bucks a month would you feel comfortable asking\nYour neighbors for some extra income\n\n... I wouldn't personally\nAnd that and yet you if you want the government to go collect the money from the people and then give it to you what's the difference between you asking your next door neighbor they could just spare me an extra hundred bucks a month for doing nothing for you\nYou you won't ask your neighbor for it but you want the government to come take it from your neighbor to the point of a gun and give it to you is there any\nOr you you you won't ask your neighbor for it but you want the government to come take it from your neighbor to the point of a gun and give it to you is there any moral difference between those\nWe're under the impression that I'm already paying for this service what service not doing that with a well ... are they taking the money for me since I'm ...\nThey are but in theory what we should be\nI Can't have how can they can how can they don't take that money and just keep it it's well I don't want to pay for somebody else they\nDid it hurting did about a year ago the U.S or would I say no about a year ago the Congress changed the law and said you get to keep more of your paycheck they cut the tax rate and they let you keep more of the money you earned so you don't have to ask your next door neighbor for the money\nBut what I'm asking is you're asking for government assistance\nAnd you say well I'm paying for it why don't I get it\nWell in theory we shouldn't be supporting any body through social programs other than those who are in capable of doing for themselves so you have somebody who's quite old and and you know they they don't have any money\nWe're not going to let them die we're not going to live the ... street if you've got a kid who has no family to take care of him or her\nThen we're going to take care of them but right now I Would agree with you did an awful lot of those social programs like welfare food stamps ten of section eight and all that is going to people who could get up off their backsides and go out and get a job there seven million open jobs available we should tell them to go work\nBut I don't for the life of me understand Rob why you would want to become dependent on the government's welfare\nBecause dependency on welfare is one of those debilitating things you can do to people you tell people don't work and we'll give you money\nThere are too many people will say yes to that\nHave no pride if they had tried to get up and say give me a job earn my own pay check [noise]\n\n\nMadisonville rates may apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids list male Macs a patent pending formula with an ingredient that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases a muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom take your manhood to the max by try your first thirty day bottle free shipping and handling\nNot ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male Macs are too intense please decrease use for your free bottle text fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text S.

Seventy five FM am twelve sixty WC eight\nBucks a\nFight will come back to Lars Larson Joe over the last couple of years we've talked a lot about\nThe opioid crisis and I've done my best to try to give you a straight data because we now know that about Seventy two thousand people every year in the United states over does and the overdose because of opioids but we're actually lumping to problems together\nAre based on the numbers I've been able to find about five or six thousand of those Seventy two thousand died because of abuse of of pharmaceutical drugs the kind that come from a legitimate companies\nUh and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs\nLike heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derrick molds on who's a former special agent in charge us a sea of the United States Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration in the special operations division\nAnd he's involved in a documentary called not in vain a dark welcome to the program\n[noise] hey how are you a great it'd be on the program\nI'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody in my family at least that I'm aware of\nWho's had that but I I Know of some\nYou know for some folks I'm acquainted with who've lost kids they've lost family members\nBecause of addiction to heroin an addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary\nAbout this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the DEA says it about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so\nThe public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels that adopted poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right\nThere's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now\nThe country is what's killing people yes you're right there's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now\nThe vast majority is being killed from the mixtures of this potent center and all of a synthetic\nA drug coming right from China you know the labs in China and mixing it with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that's addicted on heroin it's a college kid that things taken the adult role pill is going to keep 'em alert in ... in ... in class and stay focused but what they don't realize is the pills are mixed with pencil and by the way\nFor the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams\nOf fencing all to kill an adult but we have a we have a much larger issue laws because\nYou know another thing is these terrorist groups like Hezbollah they're tapping into the criminal networks to their funding and their resources or we had a case a couple of years ago when I'm On Jumo is moving to a hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah and he was moving the proceeds furloughs that is a\nCartel you know so we have a very serious problem and the American public doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron rigs was Twenty years old she was a beautiful young girl who had very much\nI loved her family passion polite typical kid you know playing sports to the capital of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds it that\nBecause she got addicted and then she went out\nOn to you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in the particular you know package you she she bought but the point is is they don't know what they're getting and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control\nThey care about making money and grow in their business and the price and the scary part large is the fact that China\nIs developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country and China is a communist country so you know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know then by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities so we have multiple facets of this problem\n... I'm Talking to dirt malls who's a former special agent in charge of the da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da da da Silva is drug operations inside their borders because that seemed like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you point out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China are a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know what they're controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change\nA little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThe department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently what China\nTo try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean the ... the politics\nThe politicians will make like everything's moving down there right at but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they're not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese expert but we do know and your listeners know that China's\nEnough with them it is China it's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but we do know and your listeners know\nThat China is a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know they're they're hacking off computers they're stealing our identities they're going after our financial grades than I lecture grits\nSo you know dumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans\nSo this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially you know what's going on depending on you know who in China is actually sending at all well\nBecause I think about what they accomplish if they can manufacture drugs cheaply and the ... the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash from producing new stuff\nFlows back into China one way or the other which is good for China because ... and the soup financially so they they get to ... to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cash at the same time it's a win win and I\n[noise] I call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just in it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and\nThere's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections the drug distribution stash houses you know\nBuilding compartments these guys are all over our country\nA and honestly we've got to shut down at the border and I want to really make a difference but stuck it in the military involved and my ... my opinion\nMy opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website\nDepartment of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense\nLook at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that border\nAnd knock this nonsense off with just put the politics you know if you look at nine eleven\nThe Iraq War the Afghanistan war you add up every one that died\nThen even the Vietnam War\nStill less than how many people died last year from trucks so what is the American public in a ... wake up stop listening to these phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocket books in their wallets and their futures they're not really in it for the public safety or national security aspects\nThe story is told in not in vain it's a brand new documentary on Derek molds is very involved and Derek thank you for your work at the ... and ... and tough job and things are working on not in vain we appreciate you taking the time tonight\nThat Trump had said it's a scary time for\nYoung men um only if you lie and insert ... white men in there and do you bring on um you know professor of urban studies and and host of the BEP network to talk about white supremacy I'm halfway through the segment Anna ... switch true why from\nSomething we made up in the back room here at CNN to\nAn actual Trump strategy\nAsking will this Trump's strategy work uh it's really absolutely outrageous them and in my note to readers and I wish anyone listening wouldn't go find it and print it out\nUm put it in put it in your wallet for the next time people say oh there's no such thing as fake news um these are the guardians of the first amendment yes every once in a while there is a typo no this was a deliberate vicious\nRacists lie about the president not only was it not corrected I'm In that segment if there's been a mistake I think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break 'em and you know come up with something different to talk about\nAs far as I Know it has never been corrected on CNN Anna ... after 'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she sent out in this vein tweets\nI'm saying I made an error I'm Sorry about that something to that effect absolutely no mention of what the error was it goes to her pathetic list of ... of of of of Twitter\nOr I'm Sorry about that something to that effect absolutely no mention of what the error was it goes to her pathetic list of ... of of of Twitter followers and as as small as CNN's ratings are I Believe more people saw\nHer segment with why then you know went to ... Twitter feed to see this vague I made an error how would a segment ... correcting the entire segment\nWell and what's crazy as they could have done some legitimate journalism and said it is a scary time to be a man now and then I'll tell you this is one of the things I kept emphasizing is\nIf somebody can come out with a Finley evidence accusation that that has nothing behind it no witnesses no nothing and the person bringing the you know charge can't even remember all the details where ... who how and that can destroy\nA man or and as I pointed out in these ... times\nA man or a woman's or you know a a a ... their entire career they're good name their family wipe them out financially and say oh I'm Sorry it was a ... it was a false accusation or we think\nIt was wild but by this time you've already destroyed the British and it is a scary time when that could that one little accusation can end up destroying a person and wait until the first time\nYou know that a woman says well you know this this professional woman came on to me and they destroyed a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or\nOne time you can be sure you're going to see it again is one Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee which is why I Am insistence that he make it a man\nEveryone thinks oh don't worry they won't be able to do anything with a woman yeah 'cause you know they love their tail and they they love me no they'll just come up with something new now that we know what their playbook is they're not going to be able to pull the the false allegation of a high school groping on the next one it would be too embarrassing\nSo they'll have to do something slightly different and frankly you know you reminded me of you remember back when the ridicule was heaped on on Gerald Ford because Chevy Chase portrayed him as being incredibly clumsy and we knew if you looked at the man's history he was an athlete he\nWas the fact of layer at University of Michigan\nAnd stand out he was a stand a football player who did very very well but if you have a comedian pretend that the president is a clumsy guy\nThan people today will say well you know you remember our clumsy George Bush George Gerald Ford was\nAnd you say you know he was one that was the comedian playing the parody on the anti Republican pro left a television show set and I live\nIt had no but it becomes and they use to make fun of Reagan saying oh Reagan imagine those things from the movies and then you'd go back and say no that was actually based on history is you write who are pretending that things happened in the movie\nLook this is what's driving them absolutely mad about the Internet seemed still believe they're operating in a world without the Internet does the platform ... um well they've started with Alex Jones that Roger Stone and Gavin again is ... they're coming after Gavin again it's one of the funniest people in America um\nWho else out ... let's start with those but they're coming for ...\nWell let's start doing it back at them a ... a friend of mine I stole the line from him but I told them if you're not going to treat it I Will because he started to me that I\nI agree I think this this I I

I can play some it if you'd like\nBut these are two people they're not confronting each other the woman is just standing at a street corner a I guess we're both perhaps headed in the direction of a protest the ... guy for his side of the protest and the widow of a police officer in the direction of the you know a a a different protests to counter protest\nBut this man begins and he's a young man and the woman is not wouldn't say older but she's she's older than he is um and he just begins bashing or cursing or a wishing that her husband are you know writes in his grave after she informs him the she's the widow of a police officer who died in the terrorist attack\nAnd I don't see it running on a lot of other of the sort of mainstream media other than Fox on cable\nOr should they be have you see I haven't yet\nI've seen is yes and it I lost two of my classmates ... which is no nothing in comparison to losing a family member but I I Know for people who live in Washington I live in New York this was a local attack not just a national attack\nWe all knew people and you know this is very personal and I watch it gets so angry at walk wished computer that's that's that's my reaction but this is how the American news media fix everything\nThey get we always end up talking it up by a spike mission there the oh this comeback said this is going back to fit that you know this reporter by this they did this thing\nBut the worst bias in news media is biased by omission they hide things that are uncomfortable to their narrative if they went out there you go to Chris Chris Matt both out there saying oh the Republicans are hyping this month it's all garbage stole lie and when in fact\nNo it's the absolute truth it is a problem and you've got\nYou know monsters like this city and I mean it is absolute monster to do this you must have seen I think I\nThink he did because she was wearing an NYPD hat and he started berating her oh your husband do do do this\nAnd she said I'm not married he said well then you're you're NYPD cop boyfriend and he brings up the Abner ... assault that happened involving New York cops two decades ago ... ... you know I mean I remember 'cause I'm an old guy but I don't even know I didn't even know somebody his age would even remember it\nBut but he's breathing this woman in the most violent terms and you'd think\nThis is somebody who's not under assault he's not in the face to face grilled to grill a kind of confrontation replay it just so the audience knows what I'm Talking about I believed out all the F bombs you'll hear the beep soon\nThey're kind of\nYou know\nI'm not like you're not going to\nWait for him [noise] good\nGood might be much of a mind\nThing immigrants with their bully\nDriving a great\nRock in the grave and she's standing there waiting for a traffic light to change so she can walk\nRight in the great\nRock and the grave and she's standing there waiting for a traffic light to train so she can walk across an intersection legally and he just starts into her aunt and his screaming and yelling at her in a way that I'm very sure Dan\nFar surpasses the standard you have to hit to be called you know the crime of intimidation somebody walks up to you on the street and start\nTalking you and that kind of threatening manner they're committing a crime is it's no longer free speech you would think this would be getting a lot of play in the major media CNN MSNBC and with them having to but then they'd have to explain\nThat a lot of these anti for creeps this is their regular MO all they do is attack people even people who were doing nothing provocative\nThe things that they say I mean I I Know I've got\n... years and years of watching lifted protest under my belt the things that the car they call for adoption of police officers on to a live broadcast the name of police officer Gulf reduction police officers the foul things they say the police officers and go\nOh yeah you just things I Can't even read tea\nThey just said this to this woman\nYou know this is where the left it just doesn't end well there there's so much pent up\nAnger on their side and that they want to confront of water or he wanted to cause a scene that's what they tried to do they actually train them to do this they train them so that they can cause a scene and then if somebody does something then a whole bunch of them zoom in with cameras\nState governments all around the country that also includes two suicides and all\nOn accusations of sexual misconduct now there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I said don't collect the connect the dots but\nThey have been weaponized thing this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they all seem to go after Democrats who are telling the\nThe party line surprisingly yeah those are the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a so something very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\nBut you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along the bad people and you had some folks argues Asians that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't ...\nNo they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned to you in Colorado you know there were two very suspicious cases one in Colorado one in Arizona\nSteve ... in Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't bank on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them out scare the heck out of them and asked them to resign\nThey were targeted and and I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a\nUm a day in which Democrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years never had been an expulsion in the Colorado State house of representatives that day a Democrat got up and said\nBecause my wife was molested when she was Seventeen\nI'm going to vote yes on the expulsion of Steve ...\nNow and now this is these are law makers who are putting forth arguments that would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so\nI that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had thrown out due process\nA long time ago\nIn fact a larva got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter guidance at one of the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate sort of charges against the student athletes who are thought to have committed to sexual assault\nThen put it into effect kangaroo court\nAh and and in those cases it's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think most people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student athlete who may be a virtual you're a Democrat or a virtually Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics\nThe a political college student athlete who may be officially a Democrat or officially Republican but you know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like\nLike a judge Kavanaugh had are now justice Kavanaugh had\nSo I just want to hear the odd for that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and eat almost instantaneous reaction well if he's accused you must be guilty and let's move on to the next one that's a dangerous standard to adopt in a due process country like America\nAdded dad and my many concerns about this is the notion that you can\nUh build some kind of um\n[noise] when he goes well let me go back to what you said at the beginning ... these are people who've been trashing the culture all along and and in a heartbeat they had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans so ... number one we cannot\nBuy in to this idea the left is brilliant and building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notions and that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was\nIt was stunning and renting to hear I saw that video\nAnd and you've got lawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nYeah and that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where when an ... person does something that is a criminal uh salt in most communities to merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today and just started shouting at them screaming at them and I did it for any length of time\nIf there was a police officer within\nYou know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for certain people\nBecause they opposed Trump and then we're saying but for everyone else there is a hard and fast you know kind of

not friendlier to each other and each was to us given the Soviet Union was much stronger than China at the time is singer recorded Beijing\nWe forgot Kissinger is wisdom during the Obama

character for me to shoot the ball with and I found one it's a pleasure to welcome to the show fellow West Point grad an army that day ... days was northwestern neutral and he was recently honored as an employee benefits advisor of the year so I'm sort of like that will come from under freedom day\nThanks any appreciate the call\nTalk to us about your timing mother army what'd you go to West Point and what'd you do when you got up\nI grew up and showing up to Michigan and really nobody in my family ever been in the military for my parents or grandparents\nMy parents were teachers or Detroit my grandfathers were union workers in the factories for Chrysler Ford and I had a chance I was in high school a pre athlete and academically and an uncle of mine who lived in New York was friends with a couple of more credit whatever shooting\nAnd I was pretty good athlete and doing well academically and an uncle of mine who lived in New York and was friends with a couple of West point graduate whatever shooting range I think he went to initially suggested West Point and that's how I started to learn about it applied in junior high school\nAnd then I ended up getting recruited for football to both Army Navy and air force and um by the time I was a senior had a chance to go visit all three places and just settled on West Point just kind of fell in love with it and that was a post wanted to go\nWhat'd you do when you graduated\nSo I got out Gretchen eighty nine and I was in artillery officer I had my first assignment or post was ah Fort Campbell Kentucky so went through artillery basic school in some other schools in and landed at Fort Campbell in um after my first summer there said I'm a date equate we ended up getting deployed to Iraq and Saudi Arabia in Nineteen Ninety\nOkay and when did you get out and what'd you do when you got out of your life\nSo I went through Desert Shield Desert Storm wasn't sure if I Want to you know do a career or not but you know back and it was just funny because after nine or ten months in theater wearing live rounds and grenades and doing the deal and then I remember very specifically coming back to Fort Campbell\nAnd putting out of uniform again with my chin strep fast and then my boots tucked in our blank adapters on and and I just you know the thought of the time was we're gonna just practice the next Twenty years and we're never going to see any action I just\nChose to get out and get into the business world looking back I look at you know the just challenges and the hard times and deployments and all the things that have happened since then for my classmates that are still in and they just\nAdmire everything they've they've done and their service but for me I got out and I took on a road job originally through um a recruiting for him that kind of chased people getting out of the military and ended up in Dover, Delaware for a while for about three or four years in the commercial credit business\nLearn all about finance on that kind of thing and then had a kid and moved back home to Michigan and so that the end my career in HR and benefit and insurance field\nOkay we've got a lot in common I spent some time in Fort Campbell to back when it was airborne that's all it was right I Know the game I also deployed with a hundred ... we went to Vietnam little trip when you came back to Michigan you settle down and you obviously\nSome northwestern usually they sound and obviously you like it because you got one heck of a good award talk about what you do there\nI began my career and the Employee Benefit and insurance business originally with AGP which is a large payroll company and they had a division\nCalled total source which was like a nature and benefit outsourcing arena so I did that for about eight or nine years left there to run a large group sales and service for humanity in Michigan which is a large national insurance company that many in the military now because of their involvement with\nMilitary health care delivery and retiree health care\nAnd then it got recruited to come in northwestern mutual and she doesn't tend to run a small kinda flailing Employee Benefit agency that was part of the northwestern mutual system\nAnd it was really a great opportunity I didn't know a lot about northwest Mitchell I'll tell you that\nIn the insurance world growing up you know we were born and raised to learn the u._s._a. is wonderful and it is a tremendous company that I've always had a lot of admiration for about a client of usa since I was a kid at West point still am to this day\nYep slide northwestern mutual I Would say parallel and rivals usa in terms of quality integrity financial strength and I I didn't really know a lot about that when I got here but very quickly an ear to address your it became that so\nMy specialty is employee benefits and working with companies to help put together a group benefit plans for medical dental vision life disability all those things retirement plans\nLove that work baton and uh and we had a great run for the last seven or eight years here\nSo it sounds like it and you were there will be benefits advisor of the year\nLove that work aton Hannah and we had a great run for the last seven or eight years here\nThough it sounds it sounds like it and you were their employee benefits advisor of the year right\nYeah so Employee Benefit advisor magazine is probably the largest industry publication we have it's connected to or the national association of health underwriters which is our National Association and each year they select four or five different categories of benefits specialist to recognize and then an overall advisor the year so I was fortunate to be selected for that this year ...\nCongratulations and it was great this is going to end up going from I just read them and I'm shooting the bull with West Point ... since we are west pointers and since armies about to play here forcing football and in another month played navy Downey prognosis on how those are going to come up\nSo that's a loaded question 'cause I uh actually played football from Rick my first two years there and then had a couple of minor surgeries and didn't play but that was back in the gym young era of army football and\nThen he was amazing and you know I think three out of the four years I was there harm you went to ball games we beat navy at least three out of four years when I was there\nAnd really had a tremendous program is we struggled for a long time but I'm so proud to see what coach Montana's doing now I firmly believe we will take both games no questions asked\n'cause aren't we just got that momentum going and they've got a really solid team and program today had a chance to take my youngest son on a recruiting visit to arming couple of years ago and saw their new facilities incredible I mean just everything about west points are athletic program so our first class division one quality so I think army's got a good thing going\nWell I agree with you and they certainly have been doing well so far so therefore ah looks like we're going to keep the commander in chief trophy absolutely so what do you do when you're not taking care of your kids and a and handling employee benefits what do you do for fun\nAnd you don't hunt and fish a lot that's kinda my therapy actually at West point I was very proud to serve the president hunting and fishing club which was one thing about the academy's there's all these obscure different things you can do in terms of sports and activities and very much enjoy getting outdoors and Michigan's a great place to do that how we got a small family farm up in the thumb area where the hunt down and\nJust trying to get out do that as much as I can\nAnd a lot of my weekends are tied up chasing my kids around the country because they both are two or three play football and it's a lot of fun to watch out of the college level\nYou know watching your kids do well in anything is fun you really have the hunting and fishing club that was when I was captain of the west point chess club I couldn't play chess very well when it was really going to study of trips so [laughter]\nBut the toll taker right I think I Belong to the drama club the Spanish club whatever club to get me a free weekend out of there that was definitely a fun part of my time there\nIt was they were about out of time going back to your profession ... any kind of advice you would like our listeners to know that some insight you might share it might\nHave been in the Employee Benefit and human resource arena for about Twenty years\nIt's a tremendous field I think a lot of people in the Employee Benefit arena had been kind of a lot of the people that aren't for a long time I've been chased away because of all the fears around health care reform and you know this projection that the government's gonna take over health care\nUnder any scenario and I don't think our companies are countries that are going to go to like a single payer or government run system\nEven if we did go to something like that there's plenty of opportunity in this industry for professionals like us to get into an add value to companies because companies are always going to compete for talent in this country\nSo from a career perspective and I think anybody in the military is discipline they're smart they work harder ambitious this industry I think it's got just tremendous potential uh in the future so happy to talk to anybody about\nThe discipline they're smart they work harder ambitious this industry I think it's got just tremendous potential uh in the future so happy to talk to anybody about you know what that looks like for them\nCool how could people contact through my a Web site will show benefits group dot com an easy way to do it or they can always email me\nDavid ... that says okay well we'll survey dot com\nAnd if you lose that

the half tend to seven\nIn the third quarter a it was tough but a temple out scored\nThe myth ship men tend to seven making at Seventeen Seventeen going into the\nFourth and final quarter where it was temple that made the big play with the sixty two yard touchdown pass from Ruth ... been tail which turned out to be the game winner when we look at the steps of the gang navy was I'll gain by temple for all nine to two eighty four\nTemple had to turn over the Navy's one but maybe did when the time to possession game thirty three miners to temple twenty seven when I look at the stars of the game now from the south more pullback from Baton Rouge Louisiana\nHeadache to carries for a hundred and eighty hours in one touched off the navy and how to solve and on the defensive side or the balls a senior linebacker from milk though Virginia with twelve total pack holes in one tackle for law so\nThe navy Mitch shipment fell to the owls of temple twenty four to seven ...\nThey did indeed go down but it was certainly no slaughtered they played a good game air to air force a lost by tighter margin at San Diego state they lost Twenty one to Seventeen that well\nIt's a parent that uh uh San Diego state has their forces number as they are now the mayor of force for the eight straight talk\nAnd clothing one was in the mountain west championship game but the asked techs were able to feed the falcons in San Diego California twenty eight or twenty four\nAnd interestingly the lightning bolts that air force academy whereas on their helmet brought lightning could again once again for the second straight year there was the lightning delight which are interrupted the game\nAnd always breaks the rhythm of the game but air force came out 'cause they were ahead Seventeen or fourteen with Ronald Cleveland for a touchdown around\nWhen they asked takes out the ball and the third quarter back from the lightning struck and they had to delay the game and when they returned air force just couldn't get anything going\nSan Diego state was able to put fourteen on the board and actually one of the gang twenty eight to twenty four and show the tough game for Airforce rate fell into a and you know it's a tough season for 'em they're two and four now and\nBoth they ... they are trying to rebound and the coaches are coast near model low low on coast Calhoun are trying to\nKeep things together and and find a way to push the right buttons to finish off the year strong and we certainly hope that they do\nThank you for your comments today Thanks for being part of the team of football
