I thought he started too early in the ...\nYeah I think one of the things I\nHave interest in seeing incorporated in late game situations especially because we saw it happen a little bit in the first half there was one possession in the second quarter or both Austin Rivers and John while we're on the floor at the same time\nRivers was the one who actually brought the ball off it allowed John to start the possession\nOff the ball he ended up getting involved in the possession catching it on the move at the top of the key he was then able to put a couple of dribbles down attacking the basket and I think it was thrown will live to eat or green or man he me a for a slam on a roll\nI kind of like the idea of getting John the ball on the move in late game situations let him come from off the ball so that he can sort of surveyed the defense on the move\nIs opposed to what we sometimes see where it you know the possession starts with him and it ends with him with sort of all ten defensive eyeballs on um the whole time\nRight right no I agree and you know and because he's predictable\nYou know it's predictable you know just like when Olympic stepped in and took the charge which I didn't think it was a charge but you know everybody in the gym to gym everybody in the arena knew\nThat he was going to go to the basket\nThe charge which I didn't think it was a charge but you know everybody in the gym to gym everybody in the arena knew\nThat he was going to go to the basket and and I think Scott Brooks has incorporated\nMany offensive sets to start with John off the ball and you know what those sets that we've seen them do that it's been successful so I agree with you there Brian\nAnd I think we'll see more that is the year goes on everybody's sort of has to take a take a deep breath take a step back remember this is just game on a baby too they all count and they all matter so you hate to lose one like this but at the same time we can't necessarily be drawing too much on what the trends are going to be for this year's team just off of one game\nRight no no no you can\nLook this one stone you know it's not a killer but it's it's stuff because it's home opener it's at home it's against a team coming back to back that is I don't think is one of the elite teams in east [noise]\nUm and then we're forward rotation and missing guys like James Johnson and um you know the rest of their crew so yeah for them they may want to start or Islam is\nI mean they were missing waiters Ellington wind blowing Johnson those guys are all important pieces for them\nSo you're going to like this one so Scott ah from aspirin wants to know if his son Christopher had better grades would he have been attending the home opener today [noise]\nI Would say um\nYes I Would say yes he probably would have been to the game\nChristopher needs to focus on\nGetting his grades and doing what he needs to do without the incentive of going to a game\nThat's my thoughts where I\nFeel like Scott's asking us to question you know the answer to you\nKnow he does I think he's also asking this question 'cause he wants his son to hear me talk about it but Christopher you got to you know you got to listen to your dad and ... but you know you also I think it's good to have incentives but\nYou also go to you know put the time and\nRates are the most important thing right now but I'm\nSure are with what's happened to you for goodness sakes\nWe're good student Brian\n...

U. C. H. B. six\nYears I've been able to replace myself in a laborer I make a decent living now but I'm just content I'm kind of happy with where I'm at a question it is that I mean I don't know I mean it it is it bad to play like that if it if I'm if I'm content and\nBut there's definitely room to grow so my question I guess\nI'm not sure which direction to head because I'm at a spot where I'm fairly happy\nBut wiring so tell me why you're happy defined it briefly\nWell I think possibly and I asked myself there's a lot maybe ... or picking up off the blade but I'm I'm happy to be I brought my business close to home I don't travel a lot anymore and um I've got time and I get the money there too so\nWell congratulations well it's almost like you're feeling a little guilty\nFor being content you know they purchased contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on contentment content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the itch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I\nI'm honestly living the dream\nThis is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a blast However I'm not happy with who I Am as a husband I'm not happy with who I Am as a father meaning I can be better so I can be convenient and grateful but also want to continue to improve right you've got a great business I don't I think you know\nI think you become a successful yeah and then he wanted ... to ... well done um\nThe thing I did when I kinda hit the same place you are was I started the first stage of business and you've passed it substantially is to take care of your family and to survive in for the business to survive and they don't you get her has once you get past the desperation of that stuff\nAnd uh then the thing starts to you can control some of the variables and you brought in somebody to do some of the work you didn't want to do and you brought it closer to home and you're making good money and and so\nThat that's the next step and that's what I Do a as an example uh when I hit that stage people started saying well you'll never be successful radio if you stay in Nashville all the big radio shows are in New York or LA and I'm like what am I going to be a big radio show then 'cause I'm not going to live in New York or LA I don't mind visiting people but I'm not living there\nI like Nashville and uh well you got to have an army I have a seven minute commute and I live in a huge freaking house I'm not leaving [laughter] you know so that you know that's where you get to so then I start to go how can I is\nWell you got to have it I mean I have a seven minute commute and I live in a huge freaking house I'm not leaving you know so that you know that's where you get to so then I start to go how can I expand this without how can I expanded and scale it without destroying the parts that are finally achieved\nYou know and so can you hire some people can you expand your product lines can you make it digital or I mean what can you do to grow the\nBusiness but do it from a position of content ... now that you've got the variables control and that's that's

I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency and put the rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on and so\nMy vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she wouldn't listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new lease and I'm trying to get her off or ... she's not really to come veins but they also having trouble getting her on board with the plan and his ... you know\nI can imagine so um\nI I highly recommend you don't do anything\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to a her mother trying to help me out just 'cause she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well I\nDon't want to ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explained to her um\nGo to the house it's free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself it'll cause a divorce does you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and ... it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive\nBut er but\nDon't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have to pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing gray\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWith that that's good Faye I'm\nWith my wife and I are appeal coordinators had looked at ... get free\nAnd we need your wisdom in guided something where we also have a little disagreement um last you see that her son got very we don't give them some money to help them out really I'd knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay [noise] um\nWhy would you do that you're ...\nI'd knowing yeah knowing that we would never probably see the money and again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're always University of ...\nI you know what that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't ... for about a year I lost touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did but in the end they did and discipline Metallica our principles\nAnd or building a ... at all mhm well after six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back anything we kind of let them you know we weren't alone and be more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication to indicate me on her famous back\nWell you know as life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and it could not be repaired and my\nSon had no way to get to work this is where it gets\nSticky let 'em knowing that my wife ... parents trashed would be dispersion funds to all the fisheries including him we both agreed\nFront about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding the would immediately pay us back when the checks were written some of the logic was it they were born from us and that they were already ... her parents stress\nI'm as it today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here is going to be just to be the next couple of weeks we wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a eight thousand dollar loans to pay off for them and said well we'll do rent\nThe otherwise they'd be I'm addicted in our daughter live if there's not one to work to help out\nSo my angle is ... mirrors and because they have not given distributed responsibility to paint backyard alone I have strongly suggested and I I think that's about as far as that goes into my wife's side that my wife write the check to them having come over his side of villages\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't borrow much of it and we didn't we didn't print them and it seems simple and we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful and lemonade the temptations and\nUsing the hunt unnecessarily not ... agreed and be in my opinion be more proactive to solving this show that much from a non thousand dollars\nRight he Edie Henry you right now what's your network now what's that what's your net worth\nA ... [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred what's your household income\n[noise] ah ... thirty maybe\nOkay and we'll let me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all downfall\nMy fault yeah OK you loan money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which would you loan family money right you're the one made this mess I\nOkay I take your job now I Try to correct that they're not making it worse\nYeah and so I'm Wondering you could do as you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I should have given your my I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRide ride it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\nAre all younger members you\nLive and that's my angle hunter bright are not going to that stuff\nThey'll reimburse ... either ...\nOr ... that my angle on her brother not going to accept and legally ridiculous assumption\nThat is not gonna happen\nYou mail a check to them you know don't see this money and then you have to decide if you're going to speak to your own children over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money it's all your fault [noise]\nSo if you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do the skin\nAbsolutely ludicrous you're asking for all the trouble you cost you cause every bit of that [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both

I read the news every day and it's unbelievable this stuff that they're putting out there and people were buying\n... no ... well that's what we tried to debunk here every morning I appreciate the call though will you have a great morning sure\nAre and are we going to come back like I said Denver Riggleman on the other side of the seven thirty news next Wu ... time now seven twenty nine\nHere with John ... million ... John we've had so much rain and mold is growing offering where people have\nWhether it be ... co burns or Abigail Spanberger in paradise is or or even Tim Kaine's\nIs all of a sudden the circle back to this classic it of a vote for the Republicans and they're going to take your healthcare away from you I'm and I just find that to be just hit the testable but you're laughable at the same time\nWell it's a I mean as a surprise I mean they're pretty much intellectually bankrupt anymore and uh now now that I I think it all started with McConnell right um\nThey said we have to look at entitlements and the thing is right now I don't think people realize we're all this money comes from it actually comes from taxpayers I'm looking payroll taxes I think that combined employer employee eat\nTaxes pitching point three percent Joe ... um that everybody sort of tried to cover north actually go back to the consumer go back to the person the employee ... I'm sure it's pretty amazing to me that\nYou know nobody wants to talk about any type of you know just showed us the school realignment nobody's trying to take away anybody's healthcare shift people looking at cost and wondering what's going to happen the next Twenty years it's not a it's not something that's irrational\nAnd nobody's trying to take away anybody's healthcare shift people are looking at cost and wondering what's going to happen the next Twenty years it's not a it's not something that's a rational\n... this is the fear mongering of you know and I mentioned this earlier I Know why they do it because for most people it's theoretical\nUm you you you hear somebody saying oh I had cancer Julia Louis Dreyfus was on a one of the late night talkers last night talking about her cancer treatment and then uses that as a folk him to say everyone should have health care as if somehow we don't I had cancer to Julia ... is what I disagree with you all are to Italy on that [laughter]\nBut it it's just emotional gamut all all the\nTime and it's just I think people have the judgment intelligence Joe to see through through this gosh I Hope they do\nSo so we put us into a place to talk about what since this is going to be their argument and I hate is you know just accepting their premise but talk about the reality of what\nHealth care Social Security all these you know the classic hits are coming out from under the closets in beds of or the Democratic party candidates are talking about the reality of what we have to address in the next couple of years Denver\nSure I mean right now in title and spending if you look at Medicare Medicaid and they look at actual social programs Social Security which really isn't entitlement but it's definitely you know heading towards there's going to be a gap kind of can be completely insolvent but there's going to be a gap is Seventy percent of funding Seventy seven zero\nSeventy wow so if you and if you look at\nAnybody wanting single pair and there's not a whole lot of Republicans screaming out there take away their health care from what I can see Joe you know um but I think when you look at a price tags which are not from right leaning you're talking about center left publications no thirty two trillion dollars I'm at some point you know are Twenty one trillion in debt\nYou have to look at what is fraud waste and abuse you know what is heck what is what has healthcare for illegal immigrants cost you know is that the forty three billion is it a hundred billion you know all these different numbers at what point does Medicare and Medicaid become insolvent um how we make sure everybody's taking care of it that way it's where the fraud waste and abuse\nMay get rid of the past city in the system because you can't see what you're getting charged anywhere where's the transparency Joe I mean my own health companies coming out with a menu of what it costs when you go on to say you know on the Internet if I'm at 'cause I I have a company\nI sign both sides of the paycheck why can't I see every single health care what they charge she's at seven hundred dollars for an MRI or seven thousand seven thousand or Seventy dust and all of that you had this sort of this combined or this can joined effort\nBetween lobbyists and that in the health care and health insurance industry and you have the government that once you know actually specifically the less\nThey want to say that everybody needs to be taken care of no matter what when you have there's two things together you have these exploding cost Noah pass city in the system of portability of health care and eliminating competition and you what you see is that can we go back to some common sense I get a balance you know single parents ridiculous that's pie in the sky\nWell we've heard them talking about it and and then they say but that's competition like somebody can compete in the open market if the government started selling whiskey Denver you'd be you'd be in the deep Kim chi trying to keep up with them\nOr ABC or you know already tries to do it by ... percent tax rate and the right you know\nVirginia is one of the worst places there try to open and distillery are showing me thing because the government's involved and\nThe thing is yeah there's some basic protections I think everybody thinks we need and healthcare great well we can't have though is the government taking over everything because I certainly don't want a system where they can't even take care of seven million people in the VA how they're going to take care of three hundred million people in the United states\nYeah and that's one of the most obvious spots in I've pointed to that all the time is like really look at the VA ...\nAnd I take care of three hundred million people in the United states\nWell yeah and that's one of the most obvious spots in I've pointed to that all the time it was like really look at the VA 'cause a lot of folks say oh well if you went single payer it'd be like going through the DMV for healthcare always will know it'd be like going to be a for health care and and then of course you get that take umbrage at that affect the\nDMV for health care and go through that process I think maybe I Would just try to shelter\nReady to go in the woods and find the oath of herbs in a tree bark if we go there you know what I

important lessons and sending some really important messages and here's what I see in it\nBecause I've been watching all afternoon\nAs the caravan comes to the southern border as Mexico has been told by the United states\nYou do not let those people come through your country to our country is seen Mexico is always cared a lot about its southern border and they guarded fiercely but they don't care about is their northern border they use that as kind of a pressure relief valve\nIf they have a ... uneducated workers\nThat go north into North America and they make a lot of money and spend that money back to Mexico\nThat is annually a thirty five to forty billion dollar plus for the country of Mexico all that extra money remittances they call it coming back into Mexico it's easy money from Mexico and then all those green American dollars aid Mexico's economy it also gives some relief because\nMexico doesn't have the kind of unemployment problem that we would have evolved those illegal workers had stayed at home so that takes some pressure off it also takes the pressure of Mexico because then they might have to reform\nThey are a country that really in some ways has a lot going for it they have a lot of territory a lot of land you need that they have a lot of workers people who are willing to do labor they have\nMoney and they have\nOil you take all those things energy land capital and labor and you almost can't go wrong\nBut then you inject one other factor in corruption where the top five percent of Mexico takes most of what the country producers and the other Ninety

started tonight with the caravan was headed toward the Mexico Guatemala board\nWelcome back to Mars Mars when Joe well I started tonight with the caravan was headed\nToward the Mexico Guatemala border and I told you this is an important issue but it's been an important issue for a couple of decades long before President Trump used it as his signature issue launching his campaign in the summer of twenty Fifteen\nOr Mike Louis joined with he's right from the hill Mike it's good to have you on the program thanks for the time to nine\nLarge thanks for having me appreciate it\nSo there are folks who are saying that President Trump is ramping up on immigration is that even possible for Donald Trump to get tougher on immigration that he's been one\nBoy that's a great question uh you know the answer is no but it allows him to return an issue that has really been in the headlines recently\nAnd so whether or not he's ramping it up I guess it ... it but it hasn't been in the headlines and now it is and so the care of and that kind of given him an opportunity to kind of low hanging fruit at the softball and uh and he thinks that he's just going to hit it hit it out of the car\nRight ahead of the midterm election so your your point is well made a he hasn't ramped up really anything it's the same position that he had all along a but it doesn't allow him to uh to to re enter this into the news cycle at a very crucial thought\nWell maybe maybe if Nancy Pelosi goods conspiratorial should good shape Donald Trump or range for the caravan to arrive at precisely the right moment before the mid term so that he could bring it back up using she can launch conspiracy theory like that\nI was I think she could probably drink something like that I thought you know right now you get a lot of finger pointing across the aisle Trump of course is blaming the Democrats for allowing the caravan to come up and the Democrats are pointing right back across it him and saying wait a minute we don't control the government wants to do something about the conditions down there\nAh in in Central America so of course it's going to be a blame game this immigration in Washington and uh and and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that hasn't changed of course just a a headed these elections it's only going to get a more heated\nWell Mike let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but I'll I'll throw it out you anyway uh is impossible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends in the Democratic party but because they thought it's time to get into you into the United states before we hit those midterms in ... season changes\n[noise] well you know I think if if they were if they were thinking that you that politically I think that they would have I think they would have waited as you know with the house a kind of favorite to flip to the Democrats right now I think they would think that has a better chance of getting across later\nIn the year or next year or if the Democrats and below sea do take the gavel I you know I think\nA ... you talked to at least you talk to the advocates and you talk to the diplomats down there\nAnd there is a lot of violence that there are people legitimately fleeing\nA very dire situation and and and then of course they're going to be a lot of hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of that situation and get across the border\nWhen in fact they are probably not in any jeopardy but a ... you talked to the at least so the advocates and those on the ground down there and they think that uh you know this wouldn't have nothing to do with politics that if it did that they would certainly wait until next year a assuming that the that the ...\nThe other thing about that is that do I understand correctly 'cause I I Do keep an eye on this topic is one of my favorites for the last Twenty years is one that we ought to resolve that ah that the ... ... if you say I'm coming from a country where I'm being\nTopic is one of my favorite for the last Twenty years is one that we ought to resolve that ah\nThat the ... ... if you say I'm coming from a country where I'm being persecuted by the government because of my race religion national origin or any of the other protected categories\nThat you have a good chance of being approved as a refugee on the other hand about eighty five percent of refugee claims are refused because people say my country has a stinky economy or my country has you know crime problems\nThat those under the law or not legitimate reasons to claim refugee status\nAnd certainly yes you're exactly right and is and there are going to be both of course you know people are going to get to the border and and saw him again or probably in a very dire situation uh you know whether it's gang violence or domestic abuse or or whatever the situation is they're legitimate claims and those people\nAre by and large are are approved after they go through the process\nThen again you are going to have the hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of a\nOf a of an opportunity here\nAnd uh you know to claim that poverty is a reason to seek a asylum status or refugee status of course it's no judge appears willing to accept that and those people will probably be refused and deport it um but you're certainly right you know the the the broader point\nThat we do have a process in place that uh that once people do arrive at the border there's a process that detain a and they have to go before a judge before anything can happen and uh you know what the Trump Administration is trying to prevent that from happening at all\nBy having Mexico where somebody Central American government stop the caravan before it even gets to the border so that's kind of where we are right now the negotiation with the Mexican a law makers Mexican leaders Mexican authorities\nAnd uh there was some rumbling yesterday that a Mexican leaders had said that they would take care of it before they reached the border so this might fizzle out before\nBefore they even get to Texas or anywhere on the southern border but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out\nI'm Talking to my littlest who writes for the old dog ... that's the other piece of news and I want to know if I'm over ... I Am a Trump fan but when the caravan started and it was maybe a thousand before grew to four thousand is it is now may be even bigger than that by now\nOr the president said to Honduras poll that caravan back or you lose your foreign aid he told the same to Guatemala\nAnd then he told Mexico you let those folks across and you may find yourself without a trade deal now I was guessing that does seem to be some pretty powerful motivating pushes from the president is that the reason that Mexico isn't just opening up the gate and letting them come into Mexico and then head up the road toward America\nBut actually what Mexico is doing is offering work visas to a lot of these people say you know all these countries have different relationships and they have different laws and processes that would a company you know people who wanted to\nTo leave or enter a a a a sovereign country um you know the Guatemalan government can't very well tell its citizens that they can't travel outside of the country so\nI don't know what legal authority they would have to do so and then in ... Mexico I'm sure it has some kind of\nAgreement with all of the Central American countries and it's probably very lenient and there's probably this probably very easy to come and go so what we were hearing yesterday is that the Mexican government was going to offer some work visas and try to get a those people to stay in Mexico and not ... not reached the border\nAs a kind of an appeasement strategy for Trump because he is threatening to close the border he was threatening to put military force at the border and he was a threatening described most importantly is threatening to scrap\nThe newly a negotiated NAFTA deal and of course Mexico a doesn't want any of those things to happen so I I think they're scrambling they're they're trying to figure out a way\nTo uh to peace President Trump and prevents\nTexaco uh doesn't want any of those things to happen so I I think they're scrambling they're they're trying to figure out a way to uh to peace President Trump and prevent this caravan for rich and the border\nHey Mike this is the first time I can remember any American president Republican or Democrat doing that kinda thing telling Mexico knock it off and help us out or you're going to you're going to suffer can you think of another example where president has done that\nI Can't know and you know ... and you don't have to go back very hard to remember remember the search at the border we talked about under President Obama\nI'm at and there were just you know thousands and thousands of people and and a lot of them unaccompanied minors that was when that first started happening or as a result of a lot of the the gang the escalation of gang violence down there with the purported reason\nAnd uh but I Know President Trump wasn't you know pressing those governments to stop the people before they arrived he was just\nScrambling to find ways to process them once they did\nAnd of course that's why you had all these detention centers uh you know President Obama long before President Trump had entered centers\nOr what he didn't do a separate the families which I think that's why that issue blew up um but you know do you hear about immigration judges and the the lack of immigration judges and these people get up here in the months or even years sometimes waiting to be processed\nAnd so it's it's just a bottleneck backlogs\nA section eight housing Medicaid all the rest of that so it's a sweet deal if you can get in as a refugee\nYou could work and make them far more money than you made back at home you can be reasonably save at least compared to back home your kids get to go to school you get medical care and you can access all those free goodies paid for by the American taxpayer and if anybody thinks that's who writes\nOr fair or just or legal\nI think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcome to walk into the Lars Larson trout what's on your mind\nOr an addict get very far that\nMyth Jamal ... yeah yeah he he ... you know he's an Arab here are they going to guard like anybody else that goes for their country true\nSo why should it be a show is a dead anymore if if if that was in her home and got killed ... pop out\n... I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story\nIf somebody I went to the American consulate in Russia or Japan or France\nAnd they ended up murdered inside that consulate\nAnd it's a conflict that say from a friendly country or or a contrast until at least ... billion ally of the United states that would be an ... that would be a major story that's not just some foreign national who's gone home and and goes to an M ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a of a crime of some kind\nThis is somebody who was allegedly killed in an embassy now I Believe that his murder may be more the result of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood the fact that uh he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and that he identified where they you know the the ridiculous ... end of Islam\nAnd that had more to do with it and the fact that MBBS the guy who runs the crown prince who runs Saudi Arabia right now\nIs trying to westernize their country\nAnd the sharia folks they're hardcore Islam is do not want that to happen I think that may be more to explain why he ended up dead then the Saudi Government just simply saying we're going to silence a critic by murdering him but he wasn't just a journalist he was a political actor as well\nAnd for the most part I understand our media tell them tends to tilt to the left but when you say ... to the left\nImagine somebody who worked for a antifa one of these sub Gish crowds a drop in American cities also worked for a major newspaper or a major news organization like CNN\nAnd they played both roles the role of being a political activist as well as the role of being a journalist on television most television outfits even the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate having somebody on they'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's\nEven the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate having somebody on they'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's straight ahead news reporter which is what ... is being presented to Americans and all these stories has but he was a political actor I mean\nIf you said I have a job with the Democratic National Committee as one of their staffers but I'm also working as a journalist and CNN CNN would say no we're not going to let that happen unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so they're trying to portray this as is\nThis man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalist I have a feeling that when we finally find out the details that we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was anti Saudi Government right now\nBecause he wants to the Saudi Government to go back the other direction\nThis the ... that country while they've not always been the best friend they have been an allied to the United states\nAnd I think what the left would like to do are left would like to do is drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Washington DC\nAnd the fact is whether you like it or not if we're going to be an actor in that region and we do have to because that region could end up being a national security threat to our country we need some allies there we have one in uh in Israel\nWe could have had one in Iraq but we let everything fall apart when Obama pulled all the troops out and now we've got troops back in there but that could have been a a a a freely elected a government with the constitution was written while we were still there\nWe haven't done that and we could have had one in Saudi Arabia and one is that region started to have a real you know government of the people instead of governments being run by dictators or royal families then when you got one next door you say well why can't our country like Iran why can't we have one that's more responsive\nTo the public they don't right now
