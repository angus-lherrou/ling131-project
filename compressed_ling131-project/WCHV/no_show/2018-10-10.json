talk to you\nThe title is get this what the hell do you have to lose\nIt's got a brand new book out that I just I looked at the title of this and I thought one I got to talk to you the title is get this what the hell do you have to lose Trump's more on civil rights one welcome to the program\nAlways a pleasure large thanks for having me on to talk about the book\nIt is a pleasure to have you on to talk about this book so I Want you to start with what is the biggest thing that Donald Trump is done to try to adversely affect the civil rights of Americans\nOh I Would guess number one would be that voters depression or effort jail they said oh it was about voter fraud we're going to start a convention I think his his feelings were hurt that Hillary Clinton beat him in the popular vote by three million so he said that that didn't happen fake nose\nOr actually it was voter fraud and so he got Chris Cole back from Kansas to come and they got to start a commission\nWell guess what they couldn't find anything but they allow state legislatures to go on in terms of closing the polling places then minority areas uh increase requirements for voter id changing the time for voting I think I think he doesn't think that a minority is going to vote Republican I think that's the issue\nBut one I don't see that as voters would pressure and I want him to check and make sure that every ... every one of the cast a ballot is an American citizen entitled to cast a ballot and in fact in the two years since the sixteen election you and I disagreed on\nA in those two years we've seen people actually prosecuted for voting in from voting without having any right to do it which unit in Pennsylvania we've seen it in Texas and other places and I honestly don't think that election authorities many of whom are Democrats and liberal stage\nReally care whether people vote illegally are not\nHere is the reality there is no one there is no major I mean you might find one instance here one instance there\nAt one point they thought they had something up in New England in some states it's that old college kids with voting here and they actually are from other areas even though they're going to college and then they ... oh no the state law allows college students to vote\nSo this is what happened in this is why they had this ban that commission because it was based on a big fat nothing\nBut you know I think your initial question large is very intriguing what actually has Trump done\nThat were damaged civil rights in this country no I don't think we should ... conversation much farther without saying his rhetoric hit the way he talks has been absolutely divisive including the title of this book because it comes from his language what the hell do you have to look at him\nAnd he's talking to an all white audience at by a them and they all Michigan and he's as many people reported as if he was saying oh to the black community your neighborhoods are so poor\nYou don't have job look at the poor quality of your schools why do you vote for Democrats why not vote for me that all Trump great question well\nAnd I think the first of all this he's not talking to the black and he was talking to the white community about the black community and I think he was saying\nThose people over there are so broken so dysfunctional fill with cats and violence and Donald Trump will stand in the breach like a hero and all the snow like I'm gonna call 'em out and I'm going to keep 'em away they all muggy they won't take your dad's I thought my gosh\nHe is absolutely demonizing the black\nHow did you I I'm just confused as to how you read black community into that I think what he was saying was\nYou voted for conventional Republicans before and you didn't get what you wanted you voted for conventional Democrats before and Brock Obama I think most of the black community has conceded that he didn't really deliver much for them what do you have to lose votes for me and they did it and by the way one I'll just point this out\nDonald Trump has brought black on him\nUm what do you have to lose votes for me and they did it and by the way one I'll just point this out\nDonald Trump has brought black unemployment to its lowest level in recorded history and ... and the number of new black businesses in the last two years almost two years of the Trump Administration because of the changes regulation because of the boosted economy\nThe percentage of new black businesses up by four hundred percent nationwide now those two things have a dramatic effect on the positive nature of black employment and black entrepreneurship that's a good thing right\nWell if the numbers are right that's a very good thing because I think the primary accomplishment of the U.S civil rights movement you know going back to the Nineteen fifties like say if you start with fifty four and ground going forward to\nThe passage of a civil rights back and fix the foreign by the way the book is structured on the basis of the provisions of the civil rights act looking at voting rights housing education and the like employment law um but here's the reality Everytime President Trump\nCalls a black woman a dog or says a black people have extraordinarily low intelligence I think that's what he said about Maxine Waters the Democratic critical or\n... I Would a DREAM Act lying waters does have extraordinarily low intelligence but if you think that's very literally is mainly on one\nLet me get spending our point here is going on about you know a LeBron James is so down me make Don Lemon look smart and Don Lemon is done and of course\nYou know his divisive rhetoric was the start of his political profile because he was involved and saying we're are Obama's not an American totally fraudulently and he continued even after he'd been proven wrong and then he comes and says well anytime anybody says that you have a problem with race Mr ... he says look at the low unemployment rate\nAnd without saying oh that low unemployment rate Ninety percent of it is attributable to\nThank you Obama it's only one percent since he's been in office and the black unemployment rate remains twice the white unemployment rate with him doing nothing to try to correct\nWell you want you want to correct to result in this case I think that rising tide of the entire economy is going to lift all boats\nBut does that mean won that you're telling me that if I go on the air and criticized Chuck Schumer I'm not being a racist ... truck is about as wide as you can get but he's also a Democrat but if I criticize Maxine Waters or Sheila Jackson Lee who just had a staff member arrested for you know some crimes that they committed involving the public's information\nThat if I criticize Sheila Jackson Lee I'm a racist because Sheila Jackson Lee is black and might not allowed to print is the president not allowed to criticize black people for fear of being labeled a racist or should all Americans be subject to criticism especially when they serve in high office\nYou know you're talking to somebody who's at heart Lars and you know me well you're my friend but you know that I came up as a journalist our reporter like a ... a ... a street beat ... reporter so they're not my whole spirit is about\nHolding powerful people accountable and telling people what a powerful what the establishment is doing in this country and\nTrying to get them to act right so that's me so you can criticize anybody of any color any gender any ethnicity nationality that you want but to me when you do things like say good people find people are marching when they are Nazis white supremacists\nAnd one of them kills people and they're standing outside a synagogue with tiki torches and automatic weapons than ours I think you don't understand the history of humanity much less\nIn an outside a synagogue with tiki torches and automatic weapons than ours I think you don't understand the history of humanity much less the history of\nThe night but they don't want to I criticize those people I don't hesitate to criticize them but I also criticized\nThe black Panthers who stood out in front of the uh ... Pennsylvania ... and bill is on your being now you're being racist because you're criticizing the black Panthers no I'll criticize anyone who tries to keep Americans from voting but I don't think Donald is trying to keep people from voting\nI think he's saying there are reasons to suspect that our voting system is flawed a theory that Democrats agree with if you bring Russians into the picture and then as soon as you take Russians out of the picture and that seems to have fallen apart they say well no you can't criticize ... whether or not our voting system is subject to possible fraud\nBut I'm saying on the ground the bigger issue right now is making sure that Americans can exercise their constitutional right to go we want more people participating in our election system we want more confidence\nYou're talking about voter id yeah well I'm Talking about for a for people who are getting a car like a license to drive yeah\nAnd I'm a million a million people in California who are illegal aliens have driver's licenses and their automatic voter registration well they're not supposed\nTo not vote legally ... being a legal you guys are making stuff up on me I'm just saying\nYou can't shooting heroin legally either but it gets done a lot in the United states of America\nAnyway look I guess the reason I met I brought up guns was that I Am someone who lives in big cities I'm not a hunter I have a threat by people with God didn't have one\nYeah see that's your response but I look at all the murders look at all the mass murders look at what goes on in schools when people get these guns that so willy nilly it is a mess and on and we are not protecting ourselves or our show\nI Want to ask you a theoretical question this goes to a civil rights in his book is called what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights if you were to farm\nAny of the people in the great city of Chicago who are law abiding citizens if you arm them with guns legally unlawfully the ones who want to be armed what do you suppose would happen to crime in the famous murder capital of America Chicago Illinois\nIf there were more guys they'd be more death\nNo more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens\nYou want and you would think arm everybody get attended a gardener it's done\nIs they've never had that won all although if they can shoot well I plan to have my ... I plan to have my granddaughter shooting under adults are urging by kindergarten do you think that's a good goal you should do it for your kids\nYeah I don't want to hurt killing her friends hurt and I don't\nWant to say like Lars under adult supervision now yeah other than voting where do you think that Donald Trump has gone to war on civil rights let's talk about immigration to while we have time\nYou want to talk about immigration ask me a question but I was going around the earth or go ahead and we're doing we're else have you gone to war on civil rights we talked about that divisive rhetoric we talked about distorting\nThe reality of the black community focuses on the twenty percent that live in poverty disproportionately young people it's a very difficult situation link I think a lot of the history of this country beginning slavery but coming ...\nLegal segregation and continuing biased and bad schools that are so that is a problem but he did nor the forty percent\nOf black America that earns between thirty five and a hundred thousand you ignore the additional twelve percent earns between a hundred two hundred\nThese are people who are get up everyday Lars and then the Lars Larson conservative traditions go to work work hard to try to get ahead in the face of continue racial bias in this country this has to be celebrated I Would think conservatives would say wow look at people\nWho had some difficulties faced discrimination and yet still believe in ninth grade American Dream and believe in capitalism still a huge gap in terms of wealth between black and white America but if that Donald Trump he doesn't need to tap into the idea of what amazing accomplishment your parents to all those people are scary and I\nMean did he ever saved Harlem out do not hold on hold on to listen I'm going to tell you I don't have to\nThink he's ignoring them at all in fact if anything he celebrates the success of black Americans in a and what is emblematic of that is the most recent public opinion polls you know these national polls that are done say the black voters support for Donald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had\nThese national polls that are done say the black voters support for Donald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had and Mitt Romney did not have a great number of black Americans supporting him neither did John McCain delayed John McCain\nBut Donald Trump has higher black voters support than either one of those two guys\nYou know if we want to look at poll\nI mean let's look at the reality of the vote twenty sixteen I think he got eight percent of the boat\nYou're cooking at a poll that did not have a significant number of black people being pope participating the reality is right now two thirds of all American people of all colors think race relations in the country or worse\nIt's about the same number who say they don't approve of the way Donald Trump handles race and here's the most probably one 'cause this is something I haven't buried\nI'm very well what does he even uses kind of language racist but forty nine percent of Americans in a foxhole said Donald Trump's race so to me Lars it's like\nIgnoring the elephant in the room and saying you know what we don't want to talk about race we don't want to talk about the fact that this guy is so offensive on this issue so critical to our history and see who we are because of becoming a more diverse country won't racially diverse but there are ...\nAnd I don't know how we get around this as I said the polls are pretty clear it's you know that poll about racism eleven percent of Republicans said he's a racist and that what may be the biggest puzzle to me maybe I should ask you\nHow good people decide that you know it's just the court you just have a little problem with race and so you know what let's just pay attention\nTo that one I'll answer that when we come back I'm Talking to Juan

starts off this hour in Minneapolis Hi Nathan welcome to the ... show\nThey do they record the uh from what on earth can updating our will go\nThrough an event we bought it by a reporter and creating a truck and of course any advice for how do we wind on the trust when the government comes or don't necessarily want to give them millions of dollars on the team or nor do I wanna hold her or him right now he's like thirty five year\nGood balance I liked the agree with both straight much and so you're winded down by releasing some of it a different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so\nWe put it together we both get hit by a bus with millions of dollars in a trust to be good used only for their good uh we did not leave the money to their guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I recommend we put in that trust that the income off of the investments can be used for their care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian if there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nOf the investments can be used for the care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian if there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nIt had to be for a major medical thing possibly a little bit on a first car and cut paying for college but coming out of college when you graduate from college we would release a percentage\nAnd then we'd releasing other percentage at twenty five and another percentage at twenty seven I think we did a maybe a third third third I don't remember but we let them kind of roll it out a little bit like you say I don't want to hold a too long but also don't want an Eighteen year old to hit the lottery\nAnd to me like what we're thinking about doing too so\nYou know so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours and nobody gets it until after college age uh and so you might as well go to college [laughter] ... yeah they are just trying to track kind of trying to direct a few things from the grave but whatever I'm a control freak\nYou know ... thanks for the call brother appreciate you hanging out with his brand is with us from Huntsville, Alabama I'm Brett

Angeles I Jonathan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey thank you for having me sure what's up I'm so\nOkay I'm going to try to get to a point as fast as I can um I I call you back in January um about a a one point eight million dollar inherits\n... that are asking you how it should handle that and he told me how to go slow and I take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month\nOn gross [laughter] um but about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm spending just insane amounts of money about ten thousand dollars a month on prostitutes and strip clubs and I'm ... therapy all the above and I don't know what to do I have tried everything I go to sex addicts anonymous\nUm and I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I I've done well I spent that money on buying a house and I'm ... now and I'm doing well with that I'm a and that since then\nIt's been a long project finished but I don't know what to do about this how should handle it or anything else that you would try that I have\nA cold or I mean twenty two ... and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago I'm\nA he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause I felt a child a wrongful death situation is um ... it it's a long story about your mom my mom she's out of the picture that divorced after we talk to her I'm right and she said she that are the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a are trained to kill more um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years ago one hundred percent of the addiction to broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour dad's legacy with the money that was left to you\nAnd you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and fight to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that\nWe see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nIs that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet the access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and the good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um\nThe third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy\nThat all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority structure is a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have a family on my dad's side I'm actually a good way\nBut they know what's going on now it's so yeah\nI had some problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that just a and I I never and whenever I tried it go than they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being picked on this and I never had to trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the leash and back\nAnd okay everyone's okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK or no help but they they they're they're good but they just I don't know how well I Know that\nAll behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual\nAnd show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment to treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there is something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing\n'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly\nThink that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong [noise] how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the saw the last component I Would add to it um and you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah\nWhat I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get past store oh counseling to go with your other counseling\nGet with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character have some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there\nAre at that church ... got churches got people in them so you can find that ...\nA straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... got churches got people and um so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find\nA better synagogue I Know you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect then let's get one of the rabbi dude let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nThat goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful on by cause of the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with\nUm a lot and um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you Roger powerless and you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a\nYou know figure out a due to some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom\nAnd that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends\nWhich doesn't work for anybody whatever version of pay to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you um then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact and I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed\nThat they need a group of guys you ain't got a what my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers in your life\nOr to walk with you in these situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray\nFor you to tell you that and hold on I'll have to pick up we're going to send you a copy of Mansfield ... book [noise] uh he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff and then the man [noise] Mansfield manly men or whatever it's called [noise] and I'm just up and you need some guys around you there that's what I'm thinking\nAnd and and you need some spiritual wall had it as a component to this this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\nKnow what I've learned

figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or um you know how to just sort of finagle that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rentals

it by bus three pond courting a truck for ethics and my question is do you any advice for how do we wind down this trust one the gum comes with age [noise] I don't necessarily want to give them millions of dollars when he's Eighteen but nor do I wanna hold that over him until he was like thirty five either\nGood good balance I like that I agree with both statements and so you wind down by releasing some of it a different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so\nWe put together we both get hit by a bus or as millions of dollars in a trust to beat good used only for the good the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death we put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I\nRecommend we put in that trust that the income off of investments could be used or the care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian that there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nIn a debate for a major medical thing possibly a little bit on a first car and paying for

lottery\nAnd I think that what we're thinking about doing too so\nYou know so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours and nobody gets it until after college age uh and so you might as well go to college\n[laughter]\n... yeah yeah just trying to track kind of trying to direct a few things from the grave but whatever I'm a control freak you know ...\nThanks for the call brother

for having me sure what's up I'm so okay I'm gonna try to get to the point as fast as I can um I I call you back in January um about a a one point eight million dollar inherit and\nUm that are asking you how it should handle that and he told me how to go slow and I take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month\nI'm gross [laughter] um but about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm spending just insane amounts of money about ten thousand dollars a month on prostitutes and strip clubs and um ... all the above and I don't know what to do have tried everything I go to sex addicts anonymous\nUm and but I I I I Want to know what you would do in this situation I've I've done well I spent about how that money on buying a house and I'm ... now and I'm doing well with that and that since then\nIt's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it with anything else that you would try that I ask\nHow old are you I'm twenty two ... and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago on\nA he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause I felt I felt the wrongful death situation is um it it's a long story about your mom my mom she's out of the picture that divorced I barely talk to her um right cheat sheet at the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a trained ... um I have worked\nWith addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke if if they don't feel their addiction\nAnd so you are going to destroy\nYour dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and\nFight to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we end up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and the good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and it gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um\n[noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority\nStructure is a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have a family on my dad's side that and actually a good way but\nThey know what's going on now so I Know\nThey were I had some problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that just a and I never and whenever I tried it with them they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being effect on this and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the leash and back\nYou know K. everyone's okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment\nTo treat it only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for and there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly I\nThink that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong [noise] how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the saw the last component I Would add to it um\nBut um and you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPastoral counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character have some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there\nAre at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you\nWill find a book or synagogue I Know you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect than let's get one of the rabbi dude let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nThat goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful on by cause of the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot and um\nSo yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a due to some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom\nAnd that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends\nWhich doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I'd really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's a\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you um\nThen that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed\nThat they need a group of guys you ain't got a lot my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers in your life\nOr to walk with you in these situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray for you to tell you that I hold on I'll have to pick up we're going to send you a copy of Mansfield ... book [noise] uh he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff and then the

overwhelming\nIt's scary and infuriating at the same time people question your character you try to figure out how it happened and you worry it's going to happen again then you have to deal with

because they had no self it it's a self admitted his redundant but\n\nHad it ... surrendered that's the word I'm looking for surrender their rights by admitting that they had this psychological problem that the the\nDMV pd cue or whatever the psychologist book\nDSM\nLists as reasons because the government your government like ah like the government Carl Marx wanted sat there in the middle of the night\nWriting legislation that you know ... and nobody in the gallery it's not it's not making talk radio to some arcane piece of code that just said we want we want to protect citizens from people with psychological disorders here we're going to give it to the U.S department of health\nAnd Human Services to come up with a policy that will do this typically of federal government regulations the law that establishes them is incredibly vague\nJust want to protect people from crazy ex vets or people would say\nLike a logical disorders and and each time and in each and every time there's a mass shooting or even just anything other than a bunch of black kids shooting another bunch of black kids in Chicago there seems to be some well meaning leftist usually from a state like\nCalifornia or Colorado or Oregon that\nBrings up a bill that says\nWe uh the the the stature of this bill the timbre of this bill is based on the idea of why the parliament of health and Human Services to do something to help protect our children from these crazy people that way you know use the word crazy anymore 'cause I'd said best researcher these these troubles\nSouls ... need our help we just want to help them get the help they need before they go and buy one of those evil weapons of war\n\nAnd I told the story of carry bunk and how carry buck was ordered to be sterilized because

killing people in our session\nAnd that was prohibited if you see the help now of a mental health professional in high school all of a sudden you're twenty five years old applying for a job that might need security clearance and you're told you you can't get that job because you have this a record of psychological\nInstability because you are depressed in high school and you went and you saw that with a counselor\n\nAnd I'm not saying it shouldn't but we've created the bureaucratic approach which is not going to work for the young people of this country\nBecause it all it does doesn't protect young people from shooters or other despicable people who are having mental problems it only protects politicians from their next campaign opponent\nIt's wrapped in the oh\nWarm and fuzzy Raymond's of caring about you the same way Karl Marx sat in the coffee shop looking at the poor kids going to work in the factory saying somebody should do something about that we should vote for some people who will do something about it\nIt did this whole special on how the United states was too populous to be one country anymore\nIt was all chilling because ... that was just at the cusp of the cessation is discussions\nOr oh\nYes 'cause any country that breaks apart is stronger\n\nOur country isn't weakening because we are too big\nIs we're asking it to do the wrong things\nThis is one of the great arguments are my friend mark Meckler and the convention of states project of which are the Franklin award winner this year so I got to be careful of but you know I can be honest about it one of the things that people are concerned the most about in this convention of states project\nIs like the last time we had one of these conventions something wholly different is going to come out of it last time we did something like this the U.S constitution came out of it you can we presume that something that much better than anything ever really had been written by men would come out of it\nOr would it just be for amendments and how do you restricted to that because there are a lot of people in this world and and the president we spend a good bit of yesterday's program talking about how the president is talking about stop and frisk programs stopping crime before it happens\n\nThese mental health regulations gun confiscation Second Amendment vacations\nAre all based in the idea that if you seek help we're going to start restricting your bill of rights protected\nRights you you can't have your Second Amendment rights we need to we need to serve vale you more so your Fourth Amendment is moderately suspended certainly if you you you you can't just go around saying that you're you're crazy I mean you ask you you went to a psychotherapist\nIs is it as as much as anything chills people actually seeking help\n... the same way that the false accusations of sexual harassment or unproven lease\n\nHurt people who are actually victims of sexual assault from coming forward\n\nI got this email last week we brought up the fact that I had for the first time ever after having read Harper Lee's seminal\nTo kill a mocking bird Vatican a high school had just for the first time at the age of fifty five watch the film adaptation of it mainly because I found out Robert Duvall was and I'm like why Duvall was full Radley really\nI'm from this email came to this is from last week is it Joe\nTo kill a mocking bird you did it as much for\nThe patriarchy as anything in the Kavanaugh hearings the message in to kill a mocking bird is do the ... well not the message it in the kill a mocking bird is not the young lady was\nRoughly treated\nBy Atticus Finch it was that she had lived in Boston a false accusation her accusations should have been that her father beat her up for something ridiculous like you don't I don't like it a guy because he was a redneck racist goon\n\nBut again this is the this is what happens when we insert false narratives into stories\n\nBut when you bare false witness it\nHurts the people who come after you if the government goes and uses your\nEssential are essentially an ask for a plea for help\nAgainst you and starts to restrict your

nine pool when Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is a really disturbing piece on the law and crime website it's than Abrams website That's a sister website to media hype\nAnd it chronicles the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency now you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not\nBut that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nNow the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible that the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to\nThis setting well then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... is a database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution or that's the subject to extend some oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations\nAnd then Rand Paul asked director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist name and the and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the Pfizer system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that is why we asked you to get

now who's the fellow a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute on a great columnist of the Washington Post one of the few conservative people at that paper\nBrett or you say I was going to call your bread mark ... welcome to the program I view it it I I Want to tell you something before we get into Kavanaugh but it kind of relates to cap it off or the me too movement start with Harvey Weinstein in that case\nAnd I guess there's a big development in that case it one of the major accuses of Harvey Weinstein they've found a bunch of emails and things on a computer she left behind her last job\nAnd it turns out she had a friendly long term relationship with a guy although she apparently described it as she said I hate feeling like it's a ... and I'm Wondering if that whole case is going to start blowing up in front of us and and since it's the\nSort of the the bedrock of this whole me too movement it started everybody taking a a tough look at at the bad behavior of some people I'm Wondering what effect that might have I was I've been reading that and I got a little discombobulated so ...\nThat's one out of like what Seventy six in January ... an end to even if she did continue to have a relationship like a ... like you know I mean Monica Lewinsky was on a a wasn't a a unwilling participant it ... it was a power relationship\nWas an just the price of the United states of the White House intern is like you know it's not and that's an uneven power situation so she could very well have been depending on Harvey Weinstein for her career a and plus trying to keep it as good graces despite a sexual predator ... so I don't think that that's necessarily dispositive and you know\nNot not necessarily story but apparently there's a bit of splitting the da's office about whether or not those charges should be drawn but let's talk about ... because ... ... yesterday earlier this week Hillary Clinton comes on and effectively not effectively she says you'll get incivility back in American society the you know all the\n... and the you know the nonsense and the violence and the shouted threats and a visiting senators' offices or not their offices their homes in the middle of the night all of that will end when you give us power back\nOr are we going to be able to you know are we going to be able to have a civil society or or the Democrats simply going to say will cause trouble 'til you give us the reins of power back\nWell that's a review and looked at I mean I don't know how much lower you go then accusing someone to participating in and organizing Gingrich [laughter]\nWithout any evidence whatsoever of but apparently they you know according to Politico the Democrats thinks that they are the lessons from the capital experiences they need to be more ruthless ... just ... mind boggling\nMore ruthless and they've been the ... that we are are we are just\nRude that we're just friends of built in the pursuit of power will do anything to get power and there are two principles into kind and too soft and so\nYou know they're they're they're that's they they need to be tougher as what they're taking from all of this which is just you know I mean the fact of the matter is that what the left always does first of all they have it there are two reasons why Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court that they're both both the Democrats number one\nThey filibustered Neil Gorsuch and as a result the Republicans went nuclear do you think for a second that Mitch McConnell would have been able to muster the votes last week to go for the nuclear option they get rec having on the court court on that so the the reality is that\nThey they screwed themselves by filibustering a perfectly qualified uh you're a universally respected justice\nFor the Supreme Court and so that they had no power whatsoever to stop Kavanaugh and then the second thing is they always overreach you know ... that Christine Blasey Ford you know her story started falling apart but at least there was some issue seems credible to most most Americans disassociate volunteer or something then they start coming up with a temper a mirror store hit\nPiece in the New Yorker and then Michael have and then he comes out with this ridiculous you know these were ridiculous a affidavit that you know he was standing in line to wait his turn with girls and you know all the rest of it and then gang rapes and just it it you know they overreached and so the lesson is not\nTo to to do more of that the lessons they mean that literally helps confirmed Brett Kavanaugh because I'll turn it was so ridiculous that Republican Senate for say ... say to themselves look this is just absurd\nUh and I don't believe either those charges and bloody or salty not true either so they actually they actually helped Kavanaugh's case by going overboard and by with their attacks on first on Gorsuch and then on capital so the lesson is be smarter something stupid\nAnd I guess I Hope you don't mean by and I think the Democrats may say being smarter means we have to have a better pack of lives that are less track of all you know and and a better set of stories and I hope they don't do that\nBut frankly mark look I Know I'm critical of the media and I mean the me I'm part of the media but I'm critical of the mainstream because I don't think they're doing their jobs I don't want to I Want to know if you joined me in this because\nYou remember when when David Duke was supposed to have endorsed Donald Trump and and they said well that means Donald Trump has to decide claim that connection right away Well Mark I guarantee you there or at least a few people listen to my show who may be nasty\nIndividuals you know I think the vast majority are nice folks but I don't know everybody who lives in ...\nYou're nice folks but I don't know everybody who lives in my show there are millions of people in the radio audience so\nYou know somebody says hey there's this full on big it from Alabama who just he loves your show and he hates everybody in the world because of their skin color race religion et cetera\nAnd I say my response would be I don't control would people think and the fact that he likes my show or endorses my candidate for mayor dog catcher whatever does not really mean much of anything unless I embrace that endorsement well in this case\nI'm not seeing any ... any members of the mainstream media going to politicians right or left\nAnd saying and especially in the ... go to Nancy Pelosi ... Barbara Boxer and Chuck Schumer and the rest and say will you condemn these tactics the tactics where violence is done where you know about the protests are made and and your shopping centers house in the middle of the night and harass his wife things like will you do that\nThey will go to Donald Trump in believer in for a week\nTo say please come out of displaying David Duke which I think at the end of the day he did um but but they're not doing any of that in a case like this so they pick and choose when does say it's a major story this week that you know that that senator so and so will or won't a disclaimer this kind of behavior or by people who were advocating against Brett Kavanaugh\nDo is there any reasonable explanation for why reporters would say well it's not important to ask\nThem last yeah they're biased I mean why does the ... honestly there's so many ... and the Christine Blasey Ford story ... ... that somebody an investigative journalists ought to be going out and saying well is there some coordination here with salt flats\nOr ... you know we still talk to people enter high school and find out a little bit more about her or let's talk to find out like or is there coordination between Senate Democrats and her lawyers or how that story leak\nWhy I mean we ... we still don't know how Christine Blasey Ford's letter came out and to the press there there's a there's a lot of stuff that that is worthy of investigation and I don't think any of them but I Do it [laughter]\nNo they have no curiosity to do because it doesn't mean they were to find out yesterday or\nLast year over so why why should why should they a waste any energy\nI mean they can spend all kinds of time on on other lesser things like you know whether or not to certain people in the Trump Administration at very low levels of the campaign were you know allied with somebody else but in this case where it actually controlled whether or not a man would become the Supreme Court\nJustice that he is today or whether his he'd be ruined in his name be smart forever I'm no no ... there at all and and and I guess\nI just wonder if these reporters or have any self awareness of saying we're because they'll tell you that they're unbiased that their objective journalism they're just telling the news well then why not treat those stories equivalent because the Duke example was maybe a poor one but\nThere are lots of examples where the press will spin inordinate amounts of in time and energy tracking down he is there a connection here or not\nAnd you had this one is like not not even interested in looking into it\nWas just sitting in the press is really just you know the cloud itself and the whole philosophy for them and just to see the is an eddy charges like there were even credible to treat the Ramirez story like that was credible I mean it's just that you know they they complain when Donald Trump talks about fake news\nBut then they kill the fake news me in\nWith their behavior against Kavanaugh uh so I think I think a lot of journalists really made fools of themselves and the whole process a colonel him and that's ah they'll they'll they'll pay for us to people if I'm paying attention to it where they're losing our because that would let\nWent in TV shows up in your town be sure to have the fire department and sublease an ambulances on hand when the Tea Party shows up on the Capitol mall in Washington DC they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nSo is there a reason to do that this isn't pointed out routinely\nI Know that most reporters working for TV channels they want to find a kind of a moral equivalence well both sides do it actually that's not true is not backed up by the facts is not backed up by history so an somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only return on the left gets its power back\nIt reminds me of a four year old in the grocery store in the cereal aisle with mom who is screaming at the top of his lungs holding his breath well it'd be screaming you can't be holding his breath but he's screaming at the top of his lungs and stamping his feet\nAnd civility is only going to return when the captain crunch goes into mom shopping basket we understand it it's not rational behavior but it is the kind of behavior you expect perhaps from juvenile children\nIt is not the kind of behavior that America ought to have to tolerate coming from adults simply because they identify with the left side of the child\nIn a fight with the left side of the child let's go to Cindy Cindy welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind tonight\nOh hello life I was told that they want to\nThank you very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time your point\nOkay I thought that the credit deplorable there's many China cabinet sexual\nFinance Clinton democratic tore the actual\nClaim to have it at the\nEnd you did you notice Hillary Clinton saying well the charges against my husband she actually said this week\nAre were different the accusations are different and I read that I thought yeah they were different because the charges against I mean Bill Clinton never contested that he had sexually harassed and molested Kathleen willy who came to the oval office asking for help\nHe never contested that he had to elicit an illicit affair with Monica you know uh and and he never now of course he would not admit that he raped Juanita Broderick but that story is so well founded and well evidence\nAnd one is Roderick who's been on this program not long ago just for a couple of weeks ago during the whole cabinet business um she explained that she\nTold somebody about the assault the rate that Bill Clinton put her through within thirty minutes of it happening and she remember the details you then told other people in her close circle of friends and she told them why she feared reporting it\nBecause the man who had raped her Bill Clinton was the attorney general and he controlled the industry in which she owned two nursing homes the attorney general of Arkansas that time maybe still controls the nurse ... nursing home business he had the power to put her out of business so\nYou know Bill Clinton was accused accurately sewing Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was and what she meant but it's what my response would be your

to get brushed off and it sticks with some really incredible blue and it stays there for ten days and anytime you want to check what your sugars you just take those little meter\nAnd you hold it up next we'll go split and it's not just measuring it at that moment gets your records it are you on while his on your arms so if I don't\nOn your arm so if I don't check it all day long and then I hold the thing up their downloads all the data from the last you know seven or eight hours or whatever and it gives you a little grafted shows you here's where you ought to be and here's where you've been you know so when I you know salad for lunch or whatever and the numbers are still in good shape it's it's a good deal and\nThose stupid little finger stick things that I've been using for the last four years or so they're expensive and I know everybody says well insurance pays for it will remember we're all paying for the insurance so\nThose things can run you a buck a strip and you might check your blood sugar four or five times a day for five bucks a day in some sense or my arm is about thirty bucks and last for ten days\nSo it can actually be cheaper than the other version and you can actually kind of track and say oh I just said this would that do to my blood sugar if I had something an hour ago and it's it's really kind of cool and you know I like gives ... anyway so I thought I thought I'd tell you and and actually if I wanted to or needed to I bought this thing\nInto a on a pad or a computer and transmit all the data to my doctor not that that's necessary in my case but I kind of a cool deals so\nWell it's also good for things like that would it be your car your body or whatever to keep track of how things are going over time you know there's a nominally I have a lot of people that say well my phone you know it doesn't last forever ... do you know what forever eating meat [laughter]\nI mean did it ever last ten hours it ever go eight hours and they said well it seems like you know our\nComputers running slower my our guys all these things or whether it be your blue your blood level your blood sugar levels or or your car range gas mileage if you don't keep track of that data point over time new idea that something's wrong and so that might be a good reminder I was just looking at this you'll you'll be happy to know what's covered by Medicare for those who qualify\nOh see he's he's making a he's making a micro aggression on me by by mansion and go to that in in about six months or five months I'm going to be six years old so I'm not qualified dramatic and by the way I had to get a prescription for this damn thing and I told my dad and she says you don't need this medically and I go\nYeah but I wanted I I Want to try it out or help pay for my own my own money if I have to the meter itself is like Seventy bucks in the last I assume it'll probably the last five six years you you charge it up with the now ubiquitous minute micro USDA and to be not to see\nAnd I have to charge it I don't know once every ten days or so and it's it's really kind of handy and in any way I I think it's a it's a great little innovation and it sticks to me and there's a tiny little filament that sticks into my skin but when I first put it on its side all feel a little stick like I Do I write my finger didn't even feel a thing it's like\nHoly cow I Need a prescription to prick yourself with the old school that\nYou know see this is I don't know if they ... I don't know why because I said to my doctor I don't understand was prescription anyway and I'm not asking for a bottle of Oxitec I'm asking for a meter it's like getting a prescription for a tape measure\nAnd she said well I don't either but but uh but you have to have one so I got an hour and I said hey I Want to buy one of these and they go now cancelled so you have to have prescription\nI'm like what what was just stupid\nAnd and frankly the little cheaply meters at Walmart they're like twelve bucks and you don't need a prescription and the scripture twenty or thirty cents apiece so it's just you know you can save some money but there's a beauty if you actually made people pay for it I think the prices would come down but because of like oh it was covered by insurance\nSo they just say well we can charge you know I my wife was stunned a few years ago I said well you pick up pick me up fifty test trips I was using one of these one touches and they were All right and she comes back and says fifty strips of sixty five dollars on why\nWhy well out of the game and the insurance companies anyway let me ask you about this let me ask you about gender filters on job sites is that a form of discrimination and\nAnd is it legitimate for a company to say we are more interested in males or females in this particular job and do you think they're\nDoing it and yeah and and and then the question whether they're doing it or not we'll get to in a second and I'm going to the fence on this one and I know you hate that but let me give you both sides of the coin here on side number one the argument is\nThey want more diversity and hiring they want the candidate pool they want page one page to page three of the results to reflect the overall mix of gender now the reason they haven't had any consideration and I believe developers at length and now of course owned by Microsoft had done a really good job of keeping gender out of the equation\nThe developers have said we don't want to even enter that into the data pool we don't want to know about it because it's not necessarily relevant now what they're saying they're saying well we want to encourage diversity\nBy subtly encouraging if there's a a sixty percent female applicants indoor pool of responses to your linked to an ad we're going to put sixty percent of females on page one sixty percent of females on page to and so on and so forth so I get the intent I get the goal I get the purpose\nI'm just not sure that I Want my technology provider like linked in to be shuffling the result in such a way they could consciously or unconsciously\nDetermine who I hire I Believe the best candidate should be hired regardless of race and that's where the ... question comes in or we now putting that front and center on the same token I think we can all agree anything that helps that company be much more diverse is a good thing so it's really\nActually I'd probably disagree with you there just because look if you're going to ask for the best candidates Brian if God Forbid you end up in the hospital you you've probably been once or twice and I wanted her ... been there with family members I haven't been in the hospitals are patients since I was a kid but\nIf you do that what gender will be the predominant gender among nurses I Would say female female and I've looked at the numbers would something like eighty five Ninety percent so should we told the hospitals will you should filters so the job done as you look at her fifty actually fifty\nOne female forty nine men would you accept that and say you have to go\nNo go ahead if if the if the market is eighty five if you say you walk into a hospital the market is eighty five percent female and and you get eighty five percent female applicants now that number may vary five ten percent one way or the other but at the market as a whole is eighty five percent females\nYou're gonna get eighty five percent female applicants so the question is not are you getting the applicants and the first place the question is are you saying the same mix of applicants page after page after page well and the results would ultimately be the same\nI guess I I Would just rather they rank order people and said here the people with the best test scores were the best one ever metric you want to use a measure their capabilities\nAnd and give us those candidates will it turns out they're all female or almost all female soldier won't do it right I Want the best I don't want the nurse in the in the proper rainbow you know with the diversity actually I'd once more Republican nurses and the Democrat nurses that\nThat sounds fantastic look at the Republican nurses all that\nYeah well you know I don't I don't know I don't know how many nurses are going to ask them I guess I don't know we probably don't I just I don't care I mean it's like I Want to be like Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan who he was brought into the hospital after being shot\nAnd here's your economic lesson for today and it's a lesson that a lot of these pools at the Federal Reserve bank and had a lot of these games and it kind of us don't understand when the economy is is cooking like it is now where you've got you know near full employment you got four percent growth you've got you know or jobs for people to fill them you got more and more production\nYou know that means the economy is producing more goods and services now my question to you our says when you get an increase in the output of goods and services\nWhat happens is the price of things if it's a it's kind of meat producers more apples what happens is the price of apples to apples doesn't live it falls yup so I reject this notion I'm so glad you mentioned this concept of overheating 'cause it's a\nBogus concept you know we had rates of growth of eight percent under Reagan you remember that you know why can't the economy grow up four or five percent\nWell and in China and India have had some tremendous growth rate does well why we've got a ... do I did plan to ask you about this what you call the credit rating agency raccoon\nDescribe is from my listeners about how these government agencies have been ... you know putting the USDA approved stamp on a on a whole bunch of credits that really doesn't deserve that and and they helped create some of the problem run\nThis is one of the great scandals of the two thousand seven and two thousand eight a real estate\nYou know a crisis which led to a meltdown in the economy which was that that we have these credit rating agencies the two big ones are Moody's and Standard Poor's and allow ours up almost until the day the you know the banks collapsed\nAnd the mortgage market collapsed these agencies that are supposed to rate the credit of the debt they were\n... basically giving AAA bond ratings to all of these mortgages that were worthless and we now know that they were just you know I'm you know practically worthless because people walking away from the homes and my point would be ... why are we still\nRelying on these credit ratings agencies that they still dominate eighty percent of the market and they've got a terrible track record a related to that I'm not trying to scare people but did you know ... hours that to this day ten years after the crisis because the prices and exactly ten years ago virtually tip a day of today\nI'm the I'm the federal government is continuing to provide one hundred percent tax Arab guarantees on three and four percent down payment laws they learn nothing from no back door and exactly what we're doing the poor and\nBy the way Steve mommy I Want to make this personal\nI Am a producer who just bought a house and he was telling me gosh I said well you're having trouble getting the down payment together he says no the way they've engineer did any good credited and he's a decent job working for me if you can go about a decent job\nAnd he says one they've worked it out so we have to put one percent down but after the ... the purchases complete we actually get the one percent back\nAnd I said to effectively you're like well I agree I Want and yet\nI understand why when people find that in the marketplace they don't say that's crazy you know they say well that's great my son or daughter or brother or sister or whatever can buy a house and you say yes and they have almost no skin in the game which means if things turned south they can say well we don't have anything in this place let's just walk away from it which is part of the way\nYou know gets you know get screwed the taxpayer yes we we care devious mortgages that's why the banks make the mortgages even when they know that the person may not\nPay it back I mean it's just it is so ensure eating and and I do worry a lot about it because if you got somebody puts one or two or three percent down payment on the laws and that and let's say this house falls and value by ... percent\nNegative equity that means that they're better off just walking away from the home and that's what millions of people did and the taxpayers got old ... you know got\nA stuck holding a bag of a trillion dollars have bad that are doing it all over again in it that's the problem with government they never learn the lessons from the last place as\nWell is there any way to back away from that or or make is slightly less attractive you know I have\nA I have a solution for aren't ready yeah it's a very solution or throw that you could throw out the uh you know the um the what was the law the that they asked the sacrifices that was the um\nA of a ... a Frank and uh what was the other guy that Frank remember that yeah do you do need that all you need right just ... dollars\nAll you need is to require five or ten percent down payment to temper sat down payment on the house is that asking so much somebody puts ... percent down payment if you do that you're going to cut the number of default spiked Ninety percent because I looked at the laws that failed almost all the laws that failed and two thousand six and seven and they\nWere those below five percent down payment laws so let's just say I'm old fashioned letters back to ... percent down payment and you won't have the financial crisis like we had before\nNo in fact as I understand it in Canada I think you have to put down as much as thirty percent down and uh and the rams
