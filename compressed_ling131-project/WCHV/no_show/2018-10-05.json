Jacob\nOr get three from that deep run what what are some of the takeaways from from what you've got to experience that maybe you can take moving forward\nA big thing is just experience um you know a good and you know what kind of thrown in the fire a right away you know there's not much turnaround time from regular season or the last few games the playoffs so um you know you're throwing it right away and um you know just to build off of that and uh to have all all you know\nThings like that it's a it's just all taught you know with your personal game and I'm just getting ready for 'em you know\nPlayed you know arguably the best the caliber of Iraq is the playoffs so um that's something you know a big thick weighing something you notice the um you don't build personally in knowledge to

better than ... deserve what something good\nGood to hear [noise] um I have a quick question my brother and I are are harder than the small business and I'm Around last year my wife uncle had a had a sign up for what's called the command insurance policy\nNow I'm a little ignorant to as to what it is but he explained to me that it's ... protect my wife ... any event like that exists here but in the event that anything happened to me she kind of get my portion of the business but it also work ... their retirement fund the type of thing so I'm kind ... calling to see what\nWhat your opinion is of that type of policy and if it's necessary or or what what I should do\n... team in is what it's doing it's not a type of policy ... separate the two things ... told you a piece of crap called the whole life ... life insurance policy because it has built it is okay has built in savings program\nOkay so we're we're going to cancel the stupid ... like ... man simply means it's typically used in in a situation like urine and business ... sell agreement and the way it would work is that\nUm you you said you're in business with who your brother\nMy brother ... okay and so uh let's say you died\nThe life insurance on you would go to him giving him the money to buy your share of the business\nFrom your wife okay\nBecause he doesn't want to be a partner with your wife\n... not because he ate your wife maybe because ... but not because he had your wife but more likely because she didn't want to be in the business right so ... him the money and you do it in reverse as well he needs to buy a policy on him that goes to you but it's ... on the partner should\nHave the same thing we're both ...\nOkay so you're both gonna cancel this crap and I was gonna get up we bought a piece of crap yeah you're going to buy\nTerm life insurance little do the same thing for about ... Nicole I'm a dollar\nFor what you're seeing now\nOkay what's the face ... what's the face of Memphis given to him if you die or her\nUm I have to I'd have to double check I don't I don't remember what we signed up for like I said it was it says well over a year ago okay I'm ... and putting in you know paying their\nTheir premiums premium I suppose ... you know like I said you know have\nArticles are are you in L. L. C. or are you a general partnership that weren't escort escort okay do you have articles have been corporation that defined what happens in the event of death\nUm I'm not sure ... defined what happened to me than that and now I'm not I don't know\nYou need to have what's called I buy cell agreement\nOkay and it's funded by inexpensive term life insurance\nTerm okay have you with the term and you're certainly if there's a whole life ...\nWhole lives was the only one that has a retirement benefit later okay I've got that means that has a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you ain't got me he's like oh and you're you know when you're\n... the the cash ... the cash value will be yeah\nYou know and ... ... number at the end and I'm like okay\nSo here's the thing if you spend one acts instead of twenty X. two accomplished your business goal of being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot\nThere's a lot that died right uh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that you use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold you okay that's the problem ... life insurance has a horrible right of return\nIt's loaded with fees and uh if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value and so the ... the money that you're playing time for the money that you're paying\nExtra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nI Gotcha okay that makes sense yeah I'm In I'm In New York so I you know six months I've kinda been grinding Mickey at my wife and our own baby step to cool so I'm now going to want to cash out that whatever it is in the whole like oh yeah yeah and then you go with the term ...\nOr you get turned policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this and you can accomplish the goal and it's going to help you clean up your ass Corp\nCorporate documents by having your attorney and it's not it's a one page thing but it's yeah ... and then you need to cover that with all the four of you sit down the spouses and go okay if he dies I won't be getting money to buy\nYou out sister in law okay you're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die my wife's going to be out of business 'cause my brother's going to buy her out and he's going to have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom the okay from this new term policy\nAnd it it has stated that that money has to be used for that for\nThat specific bought for ... yeah yeah\n... that's the by cell agreement very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your\nBank your brother thanks for calling him open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money [noise] John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a life insurance today\nUm group live insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to I mean by that the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on the dark roof\nYou buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance benefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nI it's okay to buy that it's usually if you are buying it enough it's free of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for and it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in the insurance world is you leave the company\nYou can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or mine or heart attack and now you're not sure you get diabetes now you're not sure of all [noise]\nAnd you leave that company you got in a life insurance that you can't take this with you\nSays okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all their lives is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John

to be Jay in San Diego Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nMore than ... better than I deserve what's up in your world\nSo recently this week uh found out that ah my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes are so kind of this slapped in the face you know I kind of found out this week this last weekend\nSo pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I gotta take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a\nPaid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know yeah um\nAnd it's her fault on but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way into a mess and neither one of your head your head and the game\nCorrect okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a I don't want to say more to the the problem with that kind of a solution but\nA on Wednesday this week I got a I've received at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait until I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay let me ask you this then it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife an abandoned her or is she taking ownership for the shame in fact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nThat last call is very interesting topic this topic of financial infidelity read but magazine to the service at thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why your marriage isn't topping out\nNow I mean it can be a little white lies the target bags under the bed\nSnickers snake or write or or it can be big time credit card debt\nIt can be won over years running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse\nBecause you're trying to live your dream and it's turning into a nightmare\nLet me just kinda clarified this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that they do [laughter] yeah well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] so you have a smaller fires quickly\nSo here's the thing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse\nA purchase or a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm all sit down and talk Sharon Hi Elena bothers toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they knew what I mean yeah and you and I collect guns by the way so yeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out\nHave too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right or for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to sharing about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys is too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean\nAnd if your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child in the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible does like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved and I want to be again can carry that ministry of weight wants all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nYou probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who has almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there\n... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teach us so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah\nAnd the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of\nAnd the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with\nOprah why would I Do that because Oprah was wrong\nIs what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless you just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof fees freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially his fault and he owes earn apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand over the debt and he don't even know what the clips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said Oprah this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegate in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nYou sit and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got a grand in debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm standing on making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause if your wife can run up your husband can run up\nA hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life\nOr their or psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on them and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes and what we'll do the ... well\nYou know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so\nOprah's all upset with Dave goes Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together where every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month of against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other ones have been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey begin to agree on their goals and their productivity what their money goes through the roof or you'll feel like you've got a raise when you learn to do this together\nOn paper on purpose before the month begins give every dollar a name\nThat's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nThe best for your phone every dollar of every dollar pa name [noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million all real estate agents in this country\nTwo million when all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God looks down and said hey I can trust that one\nAnd you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker radio a lot quicker than we thought because\nLike Virginia even mentioned in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming and then just looking at all the student loans you thought how are we going to pay this off\nAre we going to get at home do all these different things started family but um you know definitely goes on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in those frequent fire\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will because I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nThis is required because you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game all\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so\nI had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and that was just a part of life\nAnd Sally money's going to be a room mate for life\nRight why why do people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit this into your life that we had just made the decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we weren't really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do this zero budget you know those Iraq's and budget everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loan so we were making payments like in the sand making payments to have ... a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can see like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nWith two ... two years like and that lifestyle you know but and I would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in the spirit\nUm to really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and you kind of he had countless hours worked ... hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay prayer and\nStayed in prayer to really I'm tired of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are the pains of it was it worth it\nYeah I don't know you're completely free yeah good yeah I Know\nWhat else should get out of this is like when you climb a wall the call\nAnd now you're completely free [laughter] good [laughter] I Know what else you get out of this it's like when you climb a wall of its that tall\nYou kind of come away going we can freaking do anything I mean\nThere ... strengthens me but I mean we can do anything I was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns and wine is suck your thumb you went out killed at drug at home

twelve [noise] oh no that's an excellent I'll tell you about that next week\nAlright eleven to for eleven to lower the future I knew we landed a little staggering sticks away and I'm going back there with Frito ... twenty nine\nIn August at the annual meeting of the APA learning Iraq's presented the results of a year long clinical trial with aging students who've been diagnosed\nYou know or talk to their just think tanks they sit around in a room and they say well what do you think you know and and there's never a due to it and this this you know you wanted to from the get go to have a\nOf ... of of a part of this that is that do what do you do nights so then you started work on the new shoes to help those families find the jobs that would pay them better and that's where you find yourself with the BCC\nWrecked so what I when when when the when the orange that report was launched in two thousand eleven or really borne out of the chamber of commerce with the understanding that you know\nThe only way to self sufficiency the only way out of poverty is with money you know and the only people who are willing or able and interested in giving people money week after week month after month year after year even more than they quote need our employers yeah at ... so uh it started with the chamber because of the chamber has the the the employers\nUm but it was focused on how do we move people up the income ladder and what we found even with our limited Nineteen people that we started with in two thousand and while teen once we launched a model\nWhat we found almost at the universal need was people needed more skills they needed to be more valuable in the eyes of the employer in order to get the employer to induce the employer to pay them more money\nAnd now you see this has become you know real campaign issues we go in the midterms and even beyond that into twenty Nineteen is that you know what are the states doing to support these kind of you know training programs more of these whether it be apprenticeships or however it gets done there's a lot of different\nTactics for addressing it but you know matching the employers and that was another part of this as you wanted that network so that the employers are sitting there saying yeah I haven't found any one yet I can actually find somebody that would fit that monitoring\nHim and it works both sides of the equation it works the employers who are desperate for workers are are are saying I have these jobs and I would love to ... money to people who will fill them out the other network that we activated is the job seeker network people who have been a left behind in our economy are overlooked by our economy are back on their heels\nThey're not so much thinking about what their career is going to be they're thinking about how do I put food on the table next week Morrow and pay the rent\nYou know we we we checked in you know and Tom Powell our friend from toy lift has been doing these drives were towns first new burn the whole region and then targeting just two very small almost like standards ville sized towns of a couple of hundred people that were just devastated along the rivers\nIn North Carolina but those sorts of crises highlight the when you have an overly fragile economy these families aside from just the devastation of being knocked out of their homes they haven't been able to work in a lot of cases their jobs haven't even been engaged because you know hey everything is closed\nIf you have a mortgage to pay rent to pay all these bills continue to pile up that's where the fragility of a of an economy is so important to to address\nAnd that's why I mean I think we can really count our blessings in this region we have employers\nWe have jobs we have people who want to work they want us to stay in their families we have services that can help get people from here to there we have a community college that has an incredible a workforce development a system\nAnd there is fortunately in Virginia state funding to help people get these kind of short term critical skills that they need we have\nUm childcare scholarships we have a clinics we have transportation assistance we have services\nReally what what what we've tried to do at that time in my division is figure out how do we aligned those networks the employer network net job seeker network and that provider network how do we get them all aligned behind a family so they can get to self sufficiency\nHow has it been going what kind of you know you you're in each year there's more people which means more testimony\nIn a family so they can get to self sufficiency how how has it been going what kind of you know you you and indeed cheer there's more people which means more testimony to say hey it worked for me or how has it been going there\nSo I mean you know on the one hand I we're on to something I mean I ... the model is is is showing enough to show that we're on to something and and\nUh in in in two thousand uh fourteen we when we launched the model with actual live human beings after doing a couple of years of research about what white work and you know you don't want to if you don't want to test they're evil or do you have some idea of what you're doing\n'em and we started with Nineteen people in in the first year trying to figure out if we start with the job if the job is the engine that drives the train and we find people who want to get on that train and moved to self sufficiency and\nThat was Nineteen people in in twenty fourteen Fifteen that we served we are just last week served are five hundred job seeker oh man no radio we are we're touching the people who need to move and and other people who've completed\nEighty one percent have have gotten jobs and sixty three percent of those jobs pay twenty five thousand dollars or more which was kind of the bare minimum to get out of the crush of that low wage economy so it's working on the other hand I look at sixty three percent making twenty five thousand dollars a year and I say that's not good enough right there on the right track well and that's\nThe thing and and one of these I loved about the way you did it is it starts with a job you will you go to the employers whether it's a ... you know an agency or in a point and say okay what do you need what do you not have enough of it let's go find the people and then you you also work with the community leaders whether it'd be\nYou know a a minister or just that momma that knows everybody on the block and your your finding all those ... workers those organic workers to say oh I Know somebody who could do that and that's been a great part of\nAnd that really is the key I mean we have the the the jobs and that is that is great and we now can go and talk to employers and say hey what are you looking for\nBut really the key to making this work is people and people in our community who knows the folks who've been left behind they know the person who's working full time at minimum wage making fourteen thousand dollars a year and knows that that person could could do more and and has more potential rice that person may not realize it themselves they're just working every day trying to make ends meet\nI've talked about how you know wages track to the uniqueness of your skills and you know how unique you are but that's not just in the training sometimes your your your attitude you're diligence these are all part and parcel I mean I I Know some people were the incredible ... radio voices that are awful to work with because\nThey have no diligence they have no follow through there you know and and so so much of of an employee is important to an employer beyond just the skill of doing whatever it is that company does is you know how diligent argue how committed are you how how motivated argue\nAnd and that's a that's a big part of what you guys work\nWith and what is so special about these and he's you know these people in our neighborhoods have just kind of knew everybody and their their their the glue that holds any community together yeah the the thing that has been just magical and this watching this process unfold is\nWhen when that person that we call them peers when that well connected person that peer gets information about a job which they do through this piece of technology that we built\nThey get the job and they stop and think who do I know that would be good at that job and they reach out to that person and say hey you know you took care of your grandmother when she was sick have you ever thought about her career ladder and nursing exactly and then when that person says well I'd never even knew the opportunity existed but I Would love to do that\nMagical moment when somebody recognizes the town and somebody out and then they recognize it in themselves and that's the motivation that moves the whole train\nYeah absolutely and teachers help with this as well if you go to the PVC network to work ... I I usually send people directly to the link to the orange don't report but can they go through the ... chamber dot com ridge\nThe network to work the ... I I usually send people directly to the link\nTo the orange don't report but can they go through the ... chamber dot com ridge for yes yes if you just go there I'll put a link to them on the podcast as well because I think you know as twenty Nineteen comes along as well I I think you know the more support that you have in this program\nThe importance of you know we do have political answers to some of this and and Virginia has been very good at coming up with\nPrograms that help PVC see and and other organizations\nK tech needs the support as well in the high schools uh and uh and I know you and I are both spoken passionately about the importance of programs like Kay tech um ... we need to do these things because this is also about people who if we don't do something soon they're forty years old and the train has left the station right a lot of cases\nAnd we know especially with young families that a parent who is not making ends meet is likely to have a raise a child who also isn't going to make ends meet so if we really want to address this issue which really is in all of our interest to address not just\nMorally for that family but as a community at that person is making more money and spending more money in our community we're all better off\nAnd and since affordable housing seems to be the buzz word the ... or whatever it is I Know we just had our city county summit meeting over affordable housing the best way to create affordable housing is to create a bigger population of people that can afford the housing\nCorrect I mean I think we often miss the income component of affordable housing yeah how affordable housing is housing you can afford it but we got a boost people's incomes that I can afford to housing or there is a missing wrong in our latter however I Do you know I Do work with folks who are on those entry level career ladder jobs\nAnd asked the rent increases we've really kind of you know it's you know and then I almost seemingly exponential pace\nPeople can't grab that first wrong so we're missing that first rung on the housing ladder and all that\nAnd that needs to be addressed unfortunately there have been people who have tried to and have been told nah it is so so that's what we need to address and that's why I think there is a discussion point in this to say listen look at this population right and that's that first of all wrong rich thank you so much for coming in thank you some more over for doing this\nUh and uh and for continue this and and forgiving ... something to do what it is and I'm not I'm not going to find you Jane and Jane wanted me to say thanks for giving some get some get Frank out of the house for a I appreciate it and keep up the good work\nI just want to tip my hat to Tim Hubbard who really was at in the beginning of this ah when he was a president or the chamber and really helped me a give rise to this uh initiative well\nAnd it's one of those things that self sustaining it's it's it's growing it's it's like that find that you know beautiful ivy climbs the wall if\nAnd wait till you see nothing increases your ... more than updating your homes interior in Syria that are leaning new shell room you'll find everything you need from trusted brand like Anderson Thurmond trip tracks\nAnd James hearty as well as the tools in hardware you need to complete your project\nAt our new design center and show ... between Kroger and Sam's Club\nOn ... now more than ever\nIf you can imagine it better than living can help you do that [noise]\nThe better living building supply and cabinet you design center is now open [noise]\nThirty four fifty burns more dry shuttle though\nHe is home\nTen years back football\nOur coverage begins airing\nHere on W.

election this technique should not be used by either party I think it should be condemned if there's a a real person who's been harmed in assaulted\nMore power to them their story should be heard but if you decided to simply drop a story knowing by the time they check it out and find out it's folds\nOr the the election will be over and there's no way to undo it that's wrong so tell me about what you did with young people to try and find out of college kids find out their point of view on all this\n[laughter] yeah well okay there's clearly a lot of opposition to to Kavanaugh on on the left right no question about it and you you you know the stories can continue to come out about cabinet I did this you know we went from you know he was a conservatives they don't like 'em\nAh he has a gang rape is right here to sixty yep so I Want to see what those two parts to it at first I wanted to find out what to what what they believe what idiocy can I make up their so obviously falls to see if they believe that are public in Canada for any office only the Supreme Court\nWould believe so I began with with something I said you know\nA cabinet during the hearings key he felt that we needed to take a black man's value to be worth three fits the white man's value right\nOne of the most ridiculous things you could possibly imagine right All right they're gonna laugh myself out of here a lot of the old\nUh every single person I approached believed that he said a black person is worth three fifths of a white person\nNow by the way to remind everybody where the three figure actually come from an American history\nIt's called the three fifths compromise and what happened was when there was a debate between the south in the north\nFor the to figure out on a census basis how many people you know what what what was the the um [noise] how many people were in North in the south in the country as a whole there was an agreement to count black people's three fiscal white person because it was actually the north who pushed that because they didn't want\nThe south they say well you know their slaves want to count them as citizens therefore we'll have more people than the doors less said she had the cave this week is compromise\nYeah so it has a reference in American history but it goes back a long long way there were actually college kids who believe that the the Kavanaugh are held that position that the black citizens are only three fifths of a person\nEvery single person and then I Want to see if I could talk myself so then I said well he also wants to take 'cause listen everybody is concerned that he is so dangerous to women's rights when you hear that all the time he is absolutely dangerous to women's rights\nSo I wanted to see okay let's see how far they go to believe how how big a danger he wasn't even though he said\nThat he thought that roe versus Wade was\nSupreme Court precedent and he wouldn't take that away they\nStill didn't believe him and he was a danger to women's rights in general\nI said okay let me see how far we can take that and I said well did you know that he wanted to take a woman's right to vote away\n[laughter] of course nobody believes that Lawrence well\nExcept that they all believe that and not a single person to push back and they all use in an example to say why the terrible person\nThat's insane and these are not high school kids these are college age kids so they finished K through ... education they've been admitted to an American college they're supposed to be smart enough to study in college some of the people you talked to had a year or two in college and they still thought crazy things like that\nRight that's how much they're arrangement syndrome about public in general are are that how significant the situation is because it's\n... because they know what to believe that no matter what how their way they are how how brainwashed they are when it comes to American and to what they think Republicans stand for\nWell and and I guess the really frightening thing for me is that\nThese people who consume mass media if they turn on CNN and and our MSNBC or read the New York times the Washington Post\nAh they will see stories that some of us said that is hogwash I can show you the documents that show you the thing that you just read in the Washington Post isn't true even NBC or got caught exaggerating some of what a Christine Ford had to say to Congress\nAnd they were called on it but if you don't know to call somebody on it or to go out and look it up yourself and see if that could possibly be true and you're used to consuming maybe two or three sources of media not double checking them you might be just completely taken for that are taken with that information\nNo question about it and by the way as crazy as that is that wasn't the most dangerous thing that they answered all similar to what was it ... it when it got worse was and I asked locate so clearly don't you don't want a Republican I get it why not ask you this question asked them to a question\nI said what is what is the ... what should be the role of Supreme Court\nShouldn't be what it actually is right now especially that to interpret the constitution or should they simply be promoters of social just we all know there's only one answer to this question okay every single kid I at least you know and some critics have professors\nTheir answer was promotion of social justice that is the role of the Supreme Court and then to take a step further to believe he's still can't believe we couldn't get a photo with this but we did I asked them\nIf the constitution even relevant to you that you want to you on TALK of suppressed of all the costs to show that comes Supreme Court want social justice so let's ask the question what oh well this doesn't have to you and the answer was for most people eighty percent of the kid that spoke to said it has no real well\nNo relevance even though on a daily basis they engage in free speech\nOr they are secure in their belongings the police can't just pull you out of your\nHouse and demand your papers as you walk down the street all of those things are things that are locked up in the constitution as safeguards against the government overreaching and doing things to citizens that the government should not be doing they didn't see that relevance at all\nNope they did not\nI don't know I mean it's so disturbed it's hard to imagine it just it just it's so disturbing but that is true they did\nNot see the relevance whatsoever so I mean the real danger that where the\n... I Know the real proof is when people see this where can they see your work and and these examples\nShould they go to ... Horowitz dot com and the video was right there for the city\nThat I Am I ... I mean it's great to have you on the program things you're doing this because this is a great way to sample what do people know what do people believe and at least in the case of this experiment\nHow much are they willing to believe even when it's so fallacious that most of us would call it out immediately if we're asked a question like that good for you\nHave a wonderful weekend on me that Tommy Horwitz a journalist and documentary filmmaker I'm going to get to your phone calls immediately next why\nBecause we have the fear assurance at this point that within about twenty four hours we're going to see the final votes for confirmation of America's latest Supreme Court justice\nAnd it might change your mind maybe\nYou go to if you go to any judge anywhere in America\nAnd you say judge I really hate drunk drivers one of them killed my mom so I have a reason personally to hate drunk drivers\nIf you get a drunk driver in front of him and you're going to be in front of you are you going to throw the bucket him that judge if he or she is a response will judge will say I am not going to tell you ahead of you know not recuse they're not going to prejudge a case\nSo for instance if you ever saw a judge publically come out and say every time there's an issue of land rights which comes up in court frequently around America\nI'm always going to decide on behalf of the landowner instead of the local government that may say they want to do something with land if you say every time a case comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker\nThat judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me\nJudges should never take a position that pre judge is a kind of case so for example when you have net which almost followed them in this case from the Democratic party who say your honor do you take that roe versus Wade is establish law\nAnd you're not going to challenge it well the thing is that is a pre judging a case that may come before the court\nIf you say your honor a if a if a man is suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation he should eat meat\nLee refusing say I want to answer that because the minute you prejudged case you're not a good judge anymore now almost all the things that the Democrats asked judge Kavanaugh about work questions like that\nSaying tell us promises that you won't overturn roe v way and they didn't send those turns but they were trying to get him to take positions on things that almost guaranteed will come before the Supreme Court at some point in the next thirty or forty years\nAnd they wanted him to announce a head of time\nThat he would take a position on cases that he hasn't even heard yet\nNow we don't want judges like not just explained why does that explain why he had to give non answers to most of those questions because no judge should take a position on a case ahead of time\nNot even your local judges in your town or county should take a position ahead of time now does that make sense to\nOh yes you're you're a master debater but uh I have been a master ... says I Will say that you are but uh the the the question is why are all those people opposed and a\nWhile there's one word he won the secret world of answers your question the word is abortion\nLost it totally ah during that that are that session giving his testimony and so that that is why people say he does not have the ... and\nWell hold on and have it daily pay somebody ... you must you of trying to rape a woman if somebody falsely accused you of that would you have the kind of mild tone of voice that you have with me right now when you got dragged up in front of national television cameras\nAnd told prove to us that you didn't try to rape that girl thirty six years ago\nSo you've got an accusation\nThat if people take it seriously and decide that you did this a third of a century ago\nYour career goes away you're spot on the Supreme Court goes away your job is an appeals court judge go goes away and likely your entire law practice goes away you will never be employed as a lawyer you will never be employed as a judge\nIf you are facing that kind of threat based on a false accusation what would you respond to me would you be angry\nI I was I Would certainly be against it yes but uh how come how Harvard you're what you're talking about is not a re invited him that it teaches them not\nThe ... and now you've got something wrong and I'm going to correct you on it\nJudge Kavanaugh three days ago sent a letter to Harvard He usually goes there and teaches constitutional law every year and he informed them I Am not going to be available to teach constitutional law\nHe's going to be on the Supreme Court he doesn't have time to go teach college class at this point most of them do not I don't know of a single one of the justices the teachers even at the local D.C colleges or universities\nHow in the world with a guy who's sitting on the U.S Supreme Court have the time to go all the way up up to uh up to Harvard and teach a constitutional law class he wasn't this invited he sent them the letter now I'm Glad I get a chance to straighten things out a\nLetter he sent them the ladder\nAnd all you know there were people at Harvard who said we don't want him here now if you think that influenced is Troy said may have\nBut he's the one who decided I'm not working there and he won't have the time because after tomorrow about twenty four hours from now judge Kavanaugh will

I don't take it is full of some very strange questions and you're right\nThere is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the result but you put forward the example of Pete Domenici first\nAh and the ... the idea that he came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh the degenerative disease\nOr the wasting away the frontal and temporal lobes and he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on\nBut it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps suggested to the member of Congress or senator or did they ah they really don't have any business doing the job anymore\nYeah I think that's an excellent example\nAnd you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that a Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and a arguably he really should have resigned a retired when I ...\nThe severity of that was discovered and think about where we would have been today with the cats and North Korea confirmation if he had been in and has a ... bed in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote\nA that's a practical example of stability ... uh that really arguably should have dictated resignation\nBy the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken in whether somebody's in town or out of town and that sort of thing I suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a\nHouse in signed the mortgage documents and you know signed them electronically or send them you know ... over wire scanned them and then send them back that are members of Congress should have the\nCongress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have to be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense if say you know that there's a senator from Montana or deans\nWho is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then quickly fly back to D.C to cast a ballot\nShould we at some point consider maybe the idea of allowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district or their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists in Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and there are ways to definitively verify that it is that person\nVoting and you could do it even a ... something like Skype so that you're the ... a a the counter could actually see that the person was cast as well yeah it was a little\nYou know it's funny doctor I don't know if you were Henry and I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there was a case I Know about recently a ... among some friends or acquaintances where somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer track\nAnd I said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer and they said well they have a device attached to your smartphone\nAnd you have to actually look at the camera and be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube showing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple test you know per week to assure that you've not gone back to the bottle\nAnd I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator ... smartphone a show his retinas to the camera phone my ... my phone will do that it'll confirm who you are by right now it will confirm who you are by fingerprint\nYou can do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast the vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nAbsolutely technology can do that with a with a great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not she doesn't seem to be affected all the time\nBut there have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word and that\nIs what I Would consider way outside the bounds of normal or a ... ability to express herself\nSo um we're we're gonna have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she is deposed as the ... the leader as a leader of the Dems and the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nAnd and it's Louis item that content yeah I I don't\nDon't wish her ill but if somebody is not fully capable in politics no one wants to be removed from the spot no one is likely to want to remove themselves\nTheir own party isn't likely to want to remove them and the other party catches all kinds of hell if they say well we'll take the person out because they're too crazy\nOn you're going to drag out a bunch of lunatics they'll bring out Julie sweating again and ... ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind looking evil they do mind looking and plausible\nMother where you should do that and cold results would return in a very climbing a lot of groups who worked for important
