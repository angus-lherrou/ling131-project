we're going to talk about that a bit tonight I'm going to talk with you because I Want to hear what you have to say I think you've heard my position is that\nThis is starting for the little information we have about the bombs the way they appeared the way they were delivered their construction is already starting to be the subject of a comment by people who are bomb experts who say they are amateurish\nThat they seem to have been designed not to function in other words you deliver a bomb but you never intend for it to go off\nAnd you intend for it to be found very quickly so you package it in such a way that is easily identified as a suspicious package sure to be open quickly quickly identified and never go off\nSo what's the purpose of that and why would you if you really despise the left and said I don't like Nancy Pelosi I don't like a Hillary Clinton I don't like the Obamas I don't like Maxine Waters are Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Eric Holder\nIf you are going to deliver a bomb which is in itself and the illegal act and it's a threat of violence it is an attempt to terrorize why would you do it if you didn't ever intend for the bomb to go off\nAnd you intended for the bomb to be found as quickly as possible identified him presumably removed what would be the point of something like that\nAnyway we'll talk about it tonight the department of homeland security

I say oh it was maybe I'm being broad there has for a long time made America a center of innovation not just technologically but I think I even in terms of the way we live our lives of the freedoms that we enjoy\nWe're we're in innovative country compared to the rest of the world\nOh we we are and and more innovative let's stressed that were innovative because we're free\nUm think about it if if Steve Jobs his father had left Syria does anyone that apple would would now be the most valuable company in the world only that it'd be a a\nHeadquartered in Damascus and the reality is that the U.S is where counted people are able to achieve great things because they're free to the mistake\nAnd this has made I think by people on both sides they say the U.S has innovation innovative adds a technological edge them in the U.S has no such thing free individuals in the United states\nHave a tendency to be very innovative with this is not an American thing this individual things that don't think the government can can can foster more of this this is about freeing individuals to be great\nWell and that's what I'm Talking about I'm I'm saying if there was a way I've always thought the government\nShould be like so I don't I don't ride horses a lot but I like riding horses when I can\nAnd I've always thought somebody was really good at it could sit on a horse hold the reins in his hand and not pull a whole lot if you're the kind of guy or gal who has to take those ranging yank them around to get the horse to do what you wanted to do then you're pretty bad at it if you're really good at it\nYou just kind of give a little direction here and there and you're mostly stay out of the way you know laissez faire approach to this\nOf course he just people left alone left to their own devices allowed to prosper have a tendency to prosper and and and what's important here is is that we want this to happen to global it why is the U.S so great\nInterest as an innovative power yes our people are free but think about what our\nThat is important here is is that we want this to happen in global it why is the U.S so great\nIn turn as an innovative power yes our people are free but think about what our innovations have meant for the rest of the world was the world impoverished by the fact that Microsoft was headquartered in Seattle that Amazon's Seattle that that Apple's based in Cupertino, California can I throw and Nike\nIs based in Portland, Oregon none in the world has been made better off by genius and say you look at this in a broad sense the beauty of happy having markets open is that it means that the innovation it's as though it happened right next door\nEven though I've never lived in Portland I wearing Nike shoes all the time and I'm Better for it even though I've never lived in Cupertino\nI Am in in a much better more productive person thanks to apple and so what we want is not American innovation we want global innovation we want Steve Jobs around the world to be achieved a great things because they have much better our living standards will be its talented people from around the world are free to be great\nIn fact I've never seen Nike written up this way maybe somebody has but I'm not aware of it but they're right in my backyard and I I have great admiration for the company although I think their choice with Colin Kaepernick is rather sad but as a spokesman but\nHave you noticed a you'll correct me on this but I think the first made their first shoes in Japan and then they moved out of there and I believe they went to Taiwan and then they went to China and I think they went from China to Vietnam they might have had to stop in Korea South Korea at some point but what happened was every time they went into a place for\nA while Americans can sneer at making five dollars a day sewing soccer balls or whatever it is\nThey have to accept that all of the third world countries that were I was born a third world country I was born in Taiwan and it was definitely a third world country when I was born there and fifty nine today it's one of the biggest producers electronics on the planet I think it's half the laptops or\nNinety percent of the desk tops were made in that in that one tiny little country why well there was a time when sewing shoes are blooming Jews was was a good job\nAnd and as as their economy rose because of that activity they said oh we don't need to make shoes anymore and Nike said and we don't need to pay these prices anymore they moved on but it was almost like Nike has moved from place to place\nWas like an economic lawnmower you know you what you're left behind was ... you know a society that had the opportunity to make laptop computers that they might never have had\nIf they hadn't had a couple of decades American tennis shoes\nOh absolutely I mean he he put it very well yes Nike started the first\nPlace country which their shoes are manufactured what was the fact Japan Japan was destroyed by World War two and said they started making shoes for people like Nike\nAnd then as you say they move to different countries but I Love the story about Vietnam simply because the people who worked in their factories these alleged sweat sweat shops first began by walking to work then they bike to work then they wrote scooters to work\nBy the end they're driving cars to worry about it and you look at China Today is as you well know for having been born in Taiwan, China was once it\nDesperately poor country a Nike that is I think according to shoot dog which I Know you've read\nPhil Knight said that that's where they manufacture more peril and issues than anywhere in the world I think about what are the transformative impact Nike is hat and so I'm merely said okay we've got all these innovators and the United states who have better in the world\nI Want innovators from around the world to do great things because the better the United states per se it doesn't matter where some things made if our markets are open will benefit as those ... next door\nOh to do great things because the better the United states per se it doesn't matter where something is made if our markets are open will benefit as those late next door I wear Nikes all the time is not never let me call\nJohn it's a pleasure to have you on and thanks for the work to do it freedomworks\nThanks for having me\n... glad to have you on that John Tammany with us by the way I Want to tell you about a product that I fell in love with more than Twenty years ago in fact in about a week ten and I'm Mark one full Twenty years\nOf sleeping on sleep number bed every night how does a great night sleep improve your performance how about more energy less brain far better mood and more productivity I can speak to that personally the news sleep number three sixty smart bed I sleep on one and so this is Tina\nHelps everyone from parents to pro athletes to talk show host improve their daily performance for

your ideal firmness and the new beds are so smart they sent your every move and they automatically adjust to you that keeps you sleep in great all through the night\nYou know it's just as I say just I'm not trying to minimize it but if it's attention seeking behavior\nAre we likely to see more of this kind of thing because\nYou know this is this does terrorize people\nYeah I I think we might see more and then you might see also the dreaded copy cats and they have to look all that we're looking for legal is um you know all all ...\nStates future behavior you know the the wherever that says I'm going to say well I'm not surprised or they're going to have a history of either\n... or committing thoughts of coal regardless of their means load of opportunity and um you know those little eat this will be lost on they either do something like this before or sit there where you know I always go back to the bottom\nOf the way the Unabomber ... years nobody can figure out what he was killing credit they put it in his manifesto and as soon as his brother read it they knew what he knew exactly what was it was his brother\nYeah because you recognize a lot of the uh what did you feel right at that line of crazy that that that's my brother he talks like that he writes like that and and he was he did a tremendous service and I guess I Wonder I Wonder did the time out loud\nWould you have the courage to say my brother is doing something really terrible that's taking people's lives\nI'm going to turn them in and I know the results of my turning him is going to send him to prison I I don't have any doubt in my mind I Would do that if a family member was doing such as that but I Wonder if there are other people who would say no I just don't want to know about it and I and I don't want to be responsible for sending my my brother to prison for the rest of his life\nYeah when you look at the circumstances don't forget how many people were named and injured\nOn both ... when they realize too was that was on his brother's mind his brother talked about that that that you know he felt so guilty it took so long to figure out who it was but as soon as he saw the manifesto he took tournament\nWell and here's here's the other question I Know that let's say we find out I I put up a few possibilities on our Twitter pulled tonight is it the left is it the right is it because of the election is it a garden variety nut case or is it a foreign factor it is beginning to sound like a garden variety nut cases based on the way they are because\nGary for what little we know about it right I'm Talking to Gary Byrne who's the author of secrets of the secret service in crisis of character\n'em up a piece of pie in a manila envelope that doesn't even you know conceal his weight or its size or in shape\nSeems almost designed to be identified easily and now that we're finding out the or the CNN device was not even a real explosive device although some of these were they at least had the components to go off but none of them did go off\nSo desert if if this is a garden variety nut case who said I'm going to make something that looks enough like a bomb it'll scare people have to death but I don't want it to go off I don't want it to maim or kill people and I wanted to be fairly quickly and readily identified\nAnd the amount of tape you used on those bombs in the packages I'm willing to bet the FBI is going to find fingerprints and DNA and all kinds of things is is somebody who's saying I Want to be caught and I want to be identified\nYeah the the and also stuff that also you just pointed out um you know that's ... that's a ...\nScott and I want to be identified\nYeah the ... and also something else or you just pointed out um you know it it did ... ... that's a that's a sign of a mental condition [noise]\nUm the the ... issue it's almost like being compulsive where they put so much tape on it that's that's not a real bombed builder that somebody who's got a lot of this and uh for one reason or the other they're angry\nThere detach and again when they figure out who this is you know there's certain things are going to be there and and there'll be there'll be somebody comes forward and says you know there's a ... or they'll have a record\nOr you know they'll have a record or history of anti government anti certain you know certain party a politician and I'm so yet but all that tape that's um that's a bomb building that's like craziness\nYeah and and I know people are going to say well those shows we need more mental health care we have hundreds of millions of dollars of mental health care the problem is you can't force it on people\nAnd so if the person won't ... I really think we need to revisit the civil commitment laws because you know that I hear from families all the time who say we've got a family member we know one of these days he's going to end up in one of these news stories but the cops tell us we can do nothing the lawyers tells we can do nothing\nIf we don't ... revisited the civil commitment laws I think it's not only unsafe for the general public but it's also unfair to the person who's mentally ill and we all say well we have to wait until you actually kill somebody or hurt yourself before you can do anything meaningful about Garry I

I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] show or what what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back to a family\nSo you're separated [noise] okay and family is in Los Angeles yes okay and um do you have children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on the separation that the divorce was going ahead or not\nTo say it will be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do when you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed except that she had sons from the papers or she got to file too but um and we had to follow on all the different corporations mellow sees that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm show or in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name as the student loan in mine okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your eastern one either way whose name or the credit cards in Baltimore\nEvenly are all our you're both on all of them\nWere both on all of them okay\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name is the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has one eye on the air\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nAh Fifteen in ten\n... okay\nOkay the rule on a an asset that has um\n\n... that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt the ball it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nI'm not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt okay\nYou've found on me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt in ... in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car okay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or\nWas a I'm a ...\nOr in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten Fifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea\n[noise] I'd say about Penn okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\n[noise] or if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nAnd say about that okay\nSo you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. M\nNo\nOh no I'm a ... year attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the car debt if he walks on all of it\nAt okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be\n[laughter]\nAh last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nNow a fellow and have share in the military [laughter]\nYeah no I have no security clearance you understand that he understands and I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance\nHas gone so I mean his chances of moving up\nIn the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or mine corruption but he didn't make any money should be and and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind to show it was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] ...\nI'm so sorry\nI didn't care you know he's just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is a\nChronic haven't yeah\nOkay well um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um I I think if he files and you don't\nYou've got to force him a to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell your ... to ... I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the different\nIt is in his name and probably we're going to sell yours too okay I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loans for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here so I'm Sorry your face and all this on a mouse listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you so much and thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGoing to Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh [noise] you know they had them kinda borderline whether or not and get a term life term [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm\nThe premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts [noise] into it will go for it even if it's you know three four hundred dollar a month premium um\nThree or four months for how much coverage\nFor a ten times my my pay million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nUh basically that made us\nAll kinds of you know that I get ya okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okay that would give me too [laughter] yeah okay\nYeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the white down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good good for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and my smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate\nTwo years from now or something and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so you already knew these things right um yeah\nUh but but I mean what if you took half that\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nUh two eighty or does she does she work outside the home now she works out she wishing them\nNow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in her pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million it's not the proper amount but at least for that [noise]\n\nStruggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nI mean I and and I've talked to him and people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know a main money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their lives\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\n... mom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting\nAbout money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe Manchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say no you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you friends or do you what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nJust keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you or do you what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control and they got to do that Debbie Downer right or party thing right the martyr thing you know and people do that all the time and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go\nI think you can I really am because I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can\nWhen they found that if they do at\nThe end you're already you already jumped on the front line he got slammed down as you start saying that and that conversation she gonna shut you down ghetto they are all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you are or not for her\nJust about enabling like with your alcoholic friend obviously you wouldn't allow for and drink for\nHim to a bar knowing what I Would like money to drink\nRights and my parents they're basically eating out ten death ... times a day\nFor ... and my dad just retired and they only have one income that are living on cue and kind of you know\nAnd and so when we made that they don't live in our in our state and so we go visit them and my dad he wants to take us out in the fancy dinner to show that he loved that and we love handles so much but I just want to scream absolutely not not participating in I don't want to train our relationship\nWell it just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go that you only take us out to eat or to broke that stupid\nIf you want to say that that's what you're thinking\nAnd I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but you're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn ... loose\nYou used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out\nNow I'm not in you know of course it only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and you know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went broke we killed each other I Know have bills to fight about money\nAnd um we don't fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out and say well we should look into that hey I can show you how if you want me to tell you what we're doing\nBut don't ever returning go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go out to eat all the time he got stopped that don't turn into the instructor\nBecause the instructor or you're you're not in a position to be the instructor all you can do is lead them if you want to go to ... my my pay for it because it changed my life not because you're so stupid you need it\nYou see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story that your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it pay for it for them to go through and I'm\nLike mom someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want the right now in to this is my gift

investigated what is called the Mandela\nEffect yeah did this is bizarre gimme gimme your definition of what that is\nWell I didn't know anything to a couple of years to a lady in Scotland and I'd performed a deliverance over her and she'd contacted me a couple of weeks later\nAnd asked me if I knew about this from an della fact in and these changes in specific changes\nIn the king James Bible and I said no I have not and she sent this video\nAnd I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this it just sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just delete that video and move on I was annoyed\nAnd I\nI felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just said watch this and I watched the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one\nIs a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the videos said that\nIsaiah eleven six have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings uh songs Elvis sang about it I it is the scripture that says on the line and she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that George Bush and I do a classic\nFor anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman term or go on line to King James Bible doc Palmer Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and now it says\nThe real\nLow rules that no longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ...\n... ... it's in writing it since the wolf I've never heard of that\nOr at George when I saw that and I saw that in my bibles I nearly fell off a\nMy chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again I'll take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah we do bullets said the wolves\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is what it is bizarre George it's I have no actually the only\nExplanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book the only thing that I can take over this perhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron collider\nWhich was French board out\nIn the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nAsked than if you can get Tom on the air somebody to shop for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and you it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scriptures in the entire Bible and now it says ...\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion least down with the lamb or is it just is it the ... all over the place\nIt is the wolf in every Bible now however\nA friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah ah his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is a become one that could see\nHe actually found something for me out like older encyclopedia biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and ... that is the\nOnly place that you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction [noise] and that's it everything else George says the wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he does it look at it every day for example you one day it's going to change to the wolf some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happened to be okay but the Lord's Prayer\nIs our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name like getting caught in that it will be done on earth as it is done in heaven give us to stay or go out and forgive us for trust ass as as we forgive those who trust pass against us and leaders nodded to temptation delivers from evil for the kingdom\nAnd the power and the glory forever more right you've heard about a million dollars to pay it's changed now so now with our father which are in and I never heard it like that\nHow that came to come I Will be done in the earth\nIn or near where we live in earth now you live in or the is there some\nThing that changes these things\nAnd I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at\nA but I Do believe that it is CERN and these the wave quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned that opens up the portal and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is\nIn concert and I think that it's earned that opens up the portal and sees the wave computers somehow some way whether it is some\nWay as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh\nThis is just the Bible's that are you make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you ah but yeah\nI have Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note that what ever this technology is\nApparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone\nWar of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre thing George ah do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\n... I think I Do I think I Am a couple of watching with that\nOkay well I Want you to look at this a Roman numeral new rules are now turned upside down ...\nWhat is what has happened to them\nThat this effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now so where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a of V. that's now turned upside down to where it looks like in\nA weird\nAnd again for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches your clocks and and and another ... and I've taken photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing this and and other interesting thing\nI have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock on my wall in my living room that has like metal tens for the a Roman numerals and that has not been changed\n... ... you know we're going to have our ins to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill and I would love to pull people on the line Lisa with lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was\nAnd then compare it to the statistics show yeah I've been in so overwhelming people would say that it then it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense George when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this\nThe D. E. A. you're familiar with the da ... administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the drug

very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to you would that be part of the Mandela insect\nHeight I tell you that George\nWould venture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski or the Reverend Billy Graham\nAh Nelson Mandela habits you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other um stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are Reverend um\n[noise] somehow we all had it wrong and thought these people had a five years ago and you know a lot of those folks\nThat died in more recent years here and ah there are people can swear that they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televise specials and things of that nature and it's\nMind boggling and and [noise] really interesting that I could say is that\nThe devil is a master of confusion and division so where there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George I think it used to say this or whatever and you go no no no it's always said that now we have confusion\nAnd division is going to come in and I really believe that\nThe source of this is demonic and nature and this is Jay can't take this in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great the steps in there just come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear\nThat none of the scriptures have been changed it always said the wolves fan all these other things that I'm an agent for the devil for saying this and it it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough\nGot his first in my life I Am an agent for God I'd go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yet\nThere were people\nDie in debates against me on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest strength is making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely and it's uh I'll tell you that this is where we really have to and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying are now is the time\nTo really get closer to God and ask God for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not because we are in an age of deception and it is only bother\nWhat is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not because we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God in the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nIt's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that they can be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and look people are free to believe what they want\nIt's not my job to try and twit somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God as a matter of God to speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel and I have an obligation to people\nTo tell the truth and as disturbing as it is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the bones Joe truck driving in Indiana they're going to start and Hey Joe go ahead\nHi George good thank you this myth that stuff is free ... ... you really you know\nLike I remember there's still a lie under the land myself so I I don't know it's kind of all in my mind on uh\nBut uh that's part of an effect because I think it's a fact in the actual like cereal world not just like the floats there's a couple of famous movie line ... change for ...

some type of now this is coming down to quantum physics in my opinion and this is way outta my league gets its way above my understanding and taking\n... as we said in the navy\nYeah way above but I I really truly feel that it it must be a combination of this CERN device which over to support those up and the the way of quantum computers that work in concert with that and somehow\nThat now again this is quantum physics thing ... this is a guy and all these different things that are so far beyond my understanding\nBut that is the only thing it would have to be something that ah really is on

force for his wedding gift\nAnd all this I Know and we know this because they took the opportunity to send that vaccine letter over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are masters of PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland did\nWell I Would guess he kept the board [laughter]\nWell listen as we said the letter comes to him and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by expressed today an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention call though which board president\nCleveland kindly wrote back and said I knowledge with thanks the which board which he sent me as a wedding present I accepted as an evidence of kind feeling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I shall neatly test its powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nWhen he did take it I knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board is but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and they are now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman got together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named\nAnd talk about this woman here her name as miss Helen Peters not worthy\nAnd they consider her a gift tax psychic and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device\nIt's spelled out we job they they decided let's go we just so so\nWhat should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device\nIt's spelled out we Jeff they they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know I mean I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name\nIs George anything happen it's spelled out his name sure enough and the ... came alive\nNo didn't spell out his name with somebody on the planet ... where he probably would've accused him of doing something or did it work by itself\nYou know you got to have your head of the plants and after that yeah you ...\nSo it started out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not for the uh it's really critical of crucial to the naming of the board and also to get it patented and a lot of people didn't know about our till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it it we were honoring her just last month in uh Denver, Colorado and gave\nHer beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard at are buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and and now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called the Fairmont\nCemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of a weed you board the proper way he felt and it was to burn it\nAnd he said as he was burning it he could see little ... offered and screams she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how we view the world her own fears or own desires and so I mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect the world still creating are manifest yet\nI'm going to say that's a story but what I Will comment on some boards don't work very well because it might be made out of ... a night\nAnd the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... sent to us at the ... society will take 'em and we'll refurbishing and selling they've given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nSharing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest boy the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got 'em rapidly sized started being made in Nineteen Ninety One and production minds one year after that\nSorry how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there\nAnd this we gee board is in the studio with me and I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board window\nThe studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board window the board that monitors you know my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out and I didn't know what was on what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know what the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl and hot word game Darryl ... board he should've done Georgia doesn't want those you try to get and so he took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd um you know I Do much shorter than works in the ... that was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone and I want boy that's weird ah\nAgain not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I went Darryl how're you I'm Sorry I heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me that we ... board I got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job\nI I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that ...\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there than to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning well I you know we want to blame the law by something that you'd want to make it mysteriously don't want to look at something logically first it was ironic that it it's very ironic\nI but I have to give you that George but I got to say we we we ... the the the Ford because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to board did it but that happens too often because it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the reason now now hold on that's another way to think about this too\nWe create a lot of things we could just have the thought in our mind that ... is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us\nJust for the power of our mind there's some power of unconscious mind and then send her on and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\nI don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the region board\nI Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong and there's something very wrong about\nWhat aspect of it I'm sure\nThat it can conjure up evil spirits let's say\nAlso that you can conjure anything evil in your mind and I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that even people\nEvil all over the world look around at people caught evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have evil things happens and they are real bad evil things\nDoesn't if they mean just because you get a piece of wood out our cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool and away from the tool\nThat that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool and away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose to find\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to you that the best thing to do it's not a don't do that because they're going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what do you what do you think about it what do you like about what do you want to know about\nI Want to go to come through that they want they you know what they want kids like that stuff\nOf course some adults do too I mean look up a copy of these shows are permanent investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well if it goes can see what's that going to do for you how's your life going to be and how the conversation I don't

got to win for your coast to coast them dot com\nAs well Karen you mentioned that the using the board\nIs somewhat like a permission explain that\nWell we have the ability to\nInteract and reach into the unseen dimensions it from when we came and where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between live and so I I came into this world as a very young child scenes they're having imaginary playmate\nHaving positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections and continue throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my a gateway or becomes just a channel I use to do what I actually could do I mean I did this as a child\nThat we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that and not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting away but this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's myself with my ... my beliefs about the ... my allowance at a village to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board not as much as I used to undo it a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often\nI'm used to board that I use the board would say about once every two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it\nVoice or writing off the board more often than I'm using the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks we'll be twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month\nBut I I prefer to work with a partner at part has a very busy travel schedule himself so we we do get together we'll do a session on my last anywhere from

that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with the stool and when I'm not use it I'm most of time talking about writing about it or attributes of questions about it\nWhen you are in trouble with the ... board does anybody free go\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do I ...\nYeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling for with me and if I don't have one mistake forgot one which has happened all you got to do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with a coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours gonna fly by so let's get some calls for you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program I N G\nI think he's taking my call but\nWe want to go right rate ... back when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could do out of body experiences\nAnd his family was really religious and they didn't like the things he was practicing they put him in a home for a while while and me if I had a we keyboard and I had been I actually I Do\nHe said well if you if you talk to me I can leave my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girlfriend were babies so my brother and sister\nAnd after they went so that we decided to try it and it was a really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open and we had the front door of phone you know it was\nEarly eighties we had really nothing to be afraid of ... and we're trying to talk to him\nNext thing we know we heard a weird noise and the front door the screen door opened\nAnd there was an open so we jumped up and when he when the doors are locked it and just started shutting all the windows because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in\nThe next day he called me because for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came by and you shut and we're on me I said that's it I get rid of the weeds\nYou look at things a grudge\nUn gee that's a I I Love when she shared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher self you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's a it's what it is it's really too you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and so you start having these other dimensions of a person so I don't want that doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd not one didn't have a real bad into it you know and I think\nShe spoke yourself because it is kind of weird at first we start doing this and you go how can I talk to that person is still alive isn't aboard that he uses the deceased person will no I've learned that this board can become your costs make the phone I I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone I dial on the frequency through my intentions through\nMy thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect because I've trained myself over these years to all these different things that are into this realm\nAnd do my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect

or you know what do you say that was coming out of the board is things that are coming out of you and you but I really can't buy that because as you were talking about they're ... they're the people who never met this man we're able to use the board\nAnd the board shoulders man these people have no idea who was clearly there was more than ... being coming through the board in may on before they ever got there and you know were warned not to have\nCommunication with spirit because it is that people will want and the living they'll they will die but no not anything I really believe that you're

Talking about abilities we all have\nA six sensibility we have the ability to be intuitive and half ache to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about your guy or he had\nYou had sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat's the abilities and how that turns out and humans life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have sought of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known this person for years\nIt's those things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the word on this level of using the board you're able to bring out your own six sensibilities\nSo these people using the tools were able to tap into that weather is there any a motor using a subconscious mind which includes\nThese abilities of psychic abilities or medium ship or um even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr that can cause a spirit now I'll I'll dressed the second part of that he talked about you were told not to do this often told not to do things

man you know just the polling from all the hybrid of all these different elements then it might sound cliche but there's something in a trance over and over to show for everybody and people don't believe that until they come and then they go oh I get it you're right it's\n'cause it's unique and it's very hard to describe but there's there's something there for everybody when they come to the shows\nAnd it's taken on so many different eddies and currency I remember when the first viral TSLs video of the guy whose house was choreographed to wizards in winter and we found the guy and interviewed him a and actually had him on the air at the same time as Paul O'Neil they had never met each other\nAnd we're talking with this guy from outside Cleveland he's the one that you know had the viral Youtube video and and all of a sudden we're like oh this number I Want to call them when we were interviewing while it was just you know kind of neat uh and and that kind of\nPassion for the band has been so cool and I guess why it's you know now the twentieth anniversary a tour you guys are in rehearsal you leave real soon on the tour how much pyrotechnics do you guys were hers because I mean there's a lot of flame throwers and a lot of fireworks I Can't imagine doing that at every rehearsal\nKnow not every rehearsal you'd be correct in saying that I mean I think that there are others [noise]\nProbably fewer horses were full on ... all of it and then there are some are just elements so they bring in the pyro like the last week\nOr so for her ... and they do a little safety demonstration of it all for us every year and then everybody comes up and they see what position they're going to be and so there's no accidents or anything and uh although it's it's pretty common I it's pretty easy it's easier than people would think just to not ... once\nYou've done a TESOL show you know okay don't goes down there and he never dated they take care of us are they take care of us well but it it just uh yeah I'd say the last week\nThe Richmond Coliseum folks I'm sure a sit in the box going please please please be fireworks going off of you guys are great whether this is why we billboard magazine is ... ... has you listed as one of the top twenty five touring acts of the past decade\nUh and if nobody if you've never seen it as I said and Joel I I mean this whole heartedly to embarrass you or a when I first played the the very first ESO CD for my family it's like I I I felt\nCompelled to say I feel like the electric guitar has finally become a a a music instrument viewed with the same references a cello uh and uh you know the violin and it can take its place in the musical pans again as something other than just the oh yeah it's where the kids play until they grow out\nIll in and it can take its place in the musical pants again as something other than just the oh yeah that's what the kids play until they grow out of it to a you know it really listen to the arrangements that you make within the things you do\nIt's funny I think a lot of people get into the playing guitar for the party aspect of it or they say oh you picked up the guitar for the checks or the popular or whatever I mean for me it was it was always a pathway to doing something special on life I think and just making sure that\nUm I did the best I could return appreciate it at work really hard so it's kind of like square advice read to give kids but the truth of it um I Will say though that the spoils of life through doing all that have been awesome and I wouldn't take any of that back the hardware definitely gets rewarded\nThis is where the hallmark channel appreciates sponsorship of your tour Joel but I mean to me that's a that's a story for anyone you know not everyone is a gifted guitar player or some people are gifted bakers or auto mechanics or\nAh you your sales people or whatever it is if you find that gift\nDo it would that mentality I tell my son who's culinary school graduate I said you know there's Ninety nine percent of baking is grinder it's not that amazing wedding cake that gets you on the cover of a newspaper it's that\nYou know another ... for breakfast and you know and making sure the the the the three yards in a cloud of dust gets taken care of and I and I think what you said there is really important work you know anyone to here and understand is that\nYou know you got to do the grinder work uh in order to have that spent those special moments really means something\nYeah absolutely uh it doesn't building or a music career it well it's just like anything else people like to make themselves feel victimized I think by saying they couldn't do it because they didn't get a lucky break or they weren't in the right place at the right time and all those things are just kind of\nUm enabling comments more or less to the bailout and um I think with anything you want to do in life\nIf you work hard you there there's nothing you can achieve if you work hard enough and I've never known a musician who who practiced twelve hours a day that didn't end up being beyond amazing and getting recognition so it's sometimes like well I actually going to play twelve a dancer for most is no\nUh but I mean in the end I think if if you had discipline and and hard work you can achieve a lot\nWell you know I I think it's also important to know the lesson in life that will you put out you're going to get back I think it's a really important life lessons for anybody not just musicians but you know when you're putting up positive energy

learn more get a yard sign I've got one\nIn Denver I Want to talk about um the this a story it's a local story but it's about our jail board it's about the borders and it's about these you know seven thousand to fourteen thousand disaffected communist were mad because they're communist dictator\nAh was ah just shown the door in El Salvador and Honduras and apparently we're getting reports now funded by the Venezuelans but our our jail bored just voted to replace\nA great lady who I have never met before but she's voluntarily served for nine years on the board but had the temerity to say why do we keep voting for something we've already decided to keep\nNotifying immigrations and Customs Enforcement about illegal immigrants that we have on detained or\nUm you know bring your particular brand of clarity did this the kind of clarity that says I see the problem here is the problem here is how we fix the problem because that's over this campaign what we've learned to really love about your Denver\nOr is this is this you know because we are getting it from the ... you know marchers these folks who are supposedly just walking on their own\nUh up through Mexico and you know bring some clarity to this border issue and and what we're supposed to be doing with this\nI mean as a narrative I you said something pretty interesting they're fleeing socialism and failed economies sounds like that's what our opponents are running on um our state socialism and failed economies I think that's the first thing the second thing if you had a a caravan uh um I guess of\nOf people you know coming to America right now I'm going to the United states the biggest fear is based on what is actually embedded in there and so if you're looking at it from a national security perspective every single person has to be vetted\nEvery single person has to be looked at based on the data that we have based on by metrics or DNA and they certainly\nShouldn't be allowed in the country based on the timing but also based on the simple fact that you know they're not American citizens and and gosh yes we're a nation of immigrants but the common sense thing to do is to make sure you identify each person\nUm she what they're doing at the border make sure that we have security there but you just don't let people into the country I'm sort of willy nilly um you know based on I don't even know what it's based on any more um emotion are based on the fact that\nWe shouldn't have rule of law we shouldn't have borders I just find the arguments show over the top\nUm that somehow\nWe're responsible for every single person that hits our border\nOr it's just something that's just not it's not a common sense reaction to anything it just I ... ... you know it's as if our arguments have jumped the shark of common sense and jumped the shark\nOf sort of a shame and common sense have jumped the shark of any kind of ability to do rational thought and you know for me you know it's like okay there's a character\n[noise] it's not even commonsense have jumped the shark of any kind of ability to do rational thought and you know for me you know it's like okay there's a caravan of people coming here we'd better stop them there and that they're trying to get into our country we need to make sure who these people are\nWaiting to identify who they are and and and make sure that whatever happens right we have a process in place there are not only security but also a data process to make sure we vet them\nWhat would you advise the president I had suggested that he has a pretty good relationship with the Mexican president and the incoming one set up a what I refer to a metaphorically as Ellis Island to a set up something we you know through FEMA what not on the Mexican side of the border\nAnd just you know you'll be humanitarian about it but also be humanitarian while they do what you say is that make any sense at all Denver or should we just put them I send them\nHome you know it it's for me you know I have a nation of immigrants all that great but yeah I mean first of all you know should be where we were be responsible for all their cost on the other side of the border you know that's the first thing I Would ask is like is that is that our responsibility at this point\nOr the second thing if we do decide it's our responsibility yes you know we can it was funny somebody said uh you know mentioned to me said hey we should probably provide food water\nMake sure that there is no suffering and and I agree with that we can put up a tent city\nFor thousands of people you know in a deployed location you know and we she right um and we can actually you know in a limited way probably do it engage so I think that we could do something like that but we have to we have to make sure that\nThat we have we don't become you know sort of victims ourselves to our own cries of victimization of their edge again Joe it's just hard for me to put into words how ridiculous I find the arguments so my question is you know if we had you know what if it was forty thousand people\nWhat if it was a hundred thousand people so now when you start looking at what numbers are is it three\nRight is it okay it's seven thousand people what if it was twenty thousand does that make it then we let them in how about fifty and what if it was a hundred and why are they coming here in the first place is it because of the failed economies right most of our southern neighbors is it because of the pressure is that where we want to go and\nSo and then why are we supporting these countries that there is a question and failed economies what you know show now you started actually asking rational questions and that makes the Democrats has exploded when you do that\nA Denver ah you've got an email from one of our listeners rates who says or Coburn pronounced cockburn or by the way that was probably the most priceless moment of the campaign at the beginning of the Lynchburg of foreign we actually have it set set aside for playing over and over again\nUm has a commercial insinuating Denver was uh at the towards burning stage show in ... was he within fifty miles of the Marx Brothers riot\nI'm rich asks um I I don't know I haven't seen the ad uh we usually charge money for ads so I'm not going to play somebody's head for free I'm so [laughter] I ...\nI Know I mean uh yeah doing that's\nUm no I wasn't in that um no I I uh it's just unbelievable you know I you know I fought for ethnic cleansing you know fought against ethnic cleansing national arch that'd be played somewhere you know take it out of context it seems to be the amount of every Democrat in the world\nWill be careful Denver I was in the middle of Marx Brothers weekend I was there a there are pictures of rice so being on my show since it's all guilt by association now uh\nFrom the cave Wylie coyote I mean we could find Osama bin Laden in a cave why can't we find that Wylie coyote kidney carrots uh you know it's a ridiculous cartoonish\n\nCan texted me through the smartphone app he was apparently able to find George Soros is home address by Google a but a quick note uh was just told by somebody who is familiar with Secret Service activities\nThat no male gets delivered to the homes of anyone under Secret Service protection or so they they this idea that there was a bomb at Hillary Clinton's house\nA is a con because then it would have had to have been delivered there by the secret service so anyway it again it's this guilt by association nonsense it's the old oh a everyone's yelling at ah what's her ah the Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the red herring in Lynch in Lexington\nAll everyone's yelling at Tom Garrett at the ribbon cutting about freaking road in Charlottesville\nEveryone's harassing these conservatives in and guess what this is what happened DNC headquarters in the Keith Ellison room somebody stuck is moist some finger in the air felt

sympathetic figures hey can we get one of our one of our text to do a bunch of Wylie coyote style packages from the acme pipe bomb company in started distributing them around ... guarded and and the

director thought it was a good idea and tonight we will have a table set up at the game and if you're going out to sea sick as play well he's a county please consider bringing a new code and\nI Know we always say it for a child and me that when we think about it we like to think that we're really just giving a helping hand you have any family um sometimes that code is a good is that they purchase\nAnd especially if you have families that have more than one child um that can be quite a purchase ... wait for weather comes on and we just like to be that helping hand well and we thank\nEverybody who donates we couldn't give it without air um I guess where it gets really greatly connected with a lot of agencies in schools and organizations that can get the cuts to the families

I'm just rhyming with Louis was all of that song\nMy quick two quick points for one is once you file with a taxi an agency you have to file forever they taxing agencies have this fantasy that they're going to click this money I just ship tonight I'm seven and a half dollar item okay five percent that's thirty eight cents worth of tax\nSo you're going to all the trouble to collect three eight cents worth of tax is going to cost you weigh more than thirty eight cents and then every month every quarter for the rest of my business existence I've got a file paperwork with that taxing agency that simply costing them money they're never going to collect any more revenue it's a joke\nThe other thing is the idea that somebody saving forty bucks on a set of tires and thinks they're going to put them on and take their old tires off in their driveway put the new ones on in Belgium is also a joke we've got businesses that things are losing money to not having this tax which isn't happening\nTelling people we got to go have this tax to save their business and then we got taxing agencies we think they're going to get rich when they're going to get poor by collecting all these tiny bits of tax it's never going to work it's a joke\nI appreciate them as I Know you sell some in brick and mortar some online and that's exactly the most the most businesses online\nAre are hybrids or you know I'm I'm On regular brick and mortar broadcast and I also put me on my part gas up on line and you stream and things like that so the idea that there are some that are both are appreciate the hanging on the line\nInto great point two boys I wanted to get to but you know more over the net a mark when I think Dennis was talking to was more of a uh\nAh into great points in points I wanted to get to but you know more over the net a mark when I think Dennis this is talk you do is more of a\nOf of a question for the ... Dave brats in Denver Riggleman as to whether or not this money is actually already be because I ... I remember this is a Supreme Court ruling saying it could happen but they're still has to be legislation about it is\nThat there has to be on at the state level so we go back in session we're going to have to do something to to make the effort to collect this tax and then if a correct that it's not going to work and it's not going to be a fish it that's the case\nI'm fine with that point in my main point is if we're going to collect it I Want to offset it by reducing state sales tax\nAnd that's the strongest point that if we are going to start collecting an additional two hundred two hundred and fifty million which is what the governor's office is protecting the secretary of finance I Want to reduce the burden on Virginia's taxpayers now I Know\nYou know it's not that hard to collect from a lot of people like us I'm On line Amazon whatever they're adding that tax on they go straight to your bill you check out on line and it automatically put on there and it automatically put on your credit card\nNow how it get reimbursed his estate obviously don't know\nWell it's a compliance issue and I we went through this back when Bob first put this out was the idea of the sales tax because an open Pandora's box in\nA Bob Goodlatte and I had a long shot and you know and bomb actually had a little ... years rare you get to hear Bob ... or something but the idea that you know nobody called labor junior congressman who was in charge of the committee that went overseas such a thing or was was was humorous to a degree or in a shot and Freud sense but uh the the issue\nIs and how they never came up yeah arose out of that during his tenure there right and and\nUm so it's a it's a compliance cost issue is that Dennis was saying that the ... the idea that a guy who sell some of his stuff on line is now got to I and I think it was somewhere in the magnitude of\nTwo hundred different taxing authorities you've got New York state New York City Maryland Baltimore and Washington DC I mean you know it's not just all fifty states it's also all the cities that have their own city sales tax\nOr within it and you have to comply with all that or pay somebody to comply with all that it really puts the onus on a small businesses and I get it I mean I understand\nUm you you know than a brick and mortar businesses saying well I've got rent and I've got you know busy you know building insurances and things like that I'm going to deal with and God Bless them I\nI feel for anyone who tries to build a building in Charlottesville are open a store front to you know gum [laughter] I'd I'd I'd sell online to rather than trying to go through the architectural review boards of Charlottesville around Memorial Day by day you know I guess it just comes back down to where\nAre you know ... you know if you buy something yeah I I Believe Virginia requires that you\nSay you know if you bought something you did you pay tax on it or not um I there are some\nPeople that have voluntarily this tax it if they bought stuff from out of state or on line and then some of that money actually comes in and I do believe that they're going to make a provision that you have to sell a certain amount of good for your actually\nBound to reimburse the state for the sales tax I think they're going to address some of those concerns\nWell I appreciate you know small time first of all this small amounts don't get caught up and all that type of work\nWell and that's in a you know that's the thing is I appreciate what you're doing is you're trying to get out in front of it more than I and I appreciate that American\nWell and that's it you know that's the thing is I appreciate what you're doing is you're trying to get out in front of it mark and I and I appreciate the work and\nEverybody's talking about how they're going to spend it and I want to bring it back to you know it's not our money let's let's keep it even if we're going to do it and uh and I say some of the strongly believe\nIn it but you know this guy knows people do but their own people can get the tires and then take it someplace else to add a little\nOr well and and they go with a lot of other goods

I\nThe last six years are suing the Obama administration uh Shaun\n... we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court and and you look at Joe mansion\nJoe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the issue of the second amendment\n... couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's ... really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate\nIt so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda and because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked it up before having you on today are meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when it town so you know I don't like to count the naming of post offices a procedural vote\nFor him I Do not have argued well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat healthcare being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains stay\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred percent in four years\nAnd match and said no to fix and getting rid of Obamacare and I think the west Virginians didn't like that and they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big lift to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\n...

I don't mean hon just running out of the time when does early voting start or as it started\nAnd this is in within the last year with evidence with tapes with text messages with doctors reports uh nobody that was demanding the cabin or treatment for cabinet ever demanded or for Ellison\nOr the recent report over the weekend about Cory Spartacus Booker\nOr kicked Claire McCaskill's husband and allegations made against him when he was married to his first wife\nI mean if that's the standard none of the mass for the Clintons to have this Bill Clinton to go through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt and we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour\nOn this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored ... and the hatred all ... the minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven\nWhich is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media\nThey didn't care about that either I'm very clear or you know I don't think the Kavanaugh\nStandard should be applied in in the case I Believe in due process still\nFor even Allison even for Spartacus ... work insisted on this program this Russia collusion Hillary Clinton paying for Russian lies we need to know about it and in this case people making threats of violence against the president or against any Democrat\nOh I'm the one that said ah investigate it wouldn't built when Brock Obama was president and I'm the one\nAgainst the president or against any Democrat and\nI'm the one that said uh investigate it was built when Brock Obama was president and I'm the one that electorate how we need to keep our presidents safe and secure ... shot on that ball fields and we found out it was a Bernie Sanders supporter I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for what one of his supporters does ...\n... it's not Bernie Sanders fault ... and you don't see the same\nRecognition by anybody on the left is one of hyper politicize anything they can any minute of any data to bludgeon Donald Trump politically\nAnyway Danielle McLaughlin is with us as well as Jonathan Gillum welcome both of you to the program and uh how many more weeks we're going to have another little baby Daniel McLaughlin\nHow many weeks I'm\nHi guys you know about that two weeks or so I said that wasn't lashing out from that uh you know parents for a little while thank\nYou or any truth to the room where you're going to native named your baby ... Gillum Hannity\n[laughter] wasn't she didn't want to get a show in a given how do they\nLive in the middle and you'll have any I mean I looked at my work well gradually just looked at posted\nThe real Haiti has been coming from the left it's been ignored by most in the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's just selective moral outrage being about Russia or being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric or action so I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House\nAnd I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left a\nHaitian you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there's no excuse for it you know I listened to have a clip that you just played in and out of people are harming at work or doing the same thing that we have to be ... when I asked about the extent to which the president has also made threats and talked about violence\nAnd out of the I asked you willing to us and then ... and what you do is you give me this\nIs a predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically about all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those young rich as a matter of at the new\nCNN wouldn't let their anchors use the word mom\nWhile because that said talking playing for\nThe whole point it's reality you know when you know you don't have those things are mobs going after those people I Do I'm not going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mob of the ... sign it looks like a month to me\nI looked at I think that potentially telling police officers in Long Island to rough up suspects when they get in the back in ... and you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most part and journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know\nWe don't respect but I don't see that\nI see a media that has been corrupted and complicit in advancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see Jonathan\n... [noise] well I'll tell you one thing uh I\nI I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob mob or people that may or may not have the same interests to gather\nA to do is sort of thing but in this case are these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... on these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um [noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going on\nPeople show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um a a it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though I I Want Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing\nOr all of that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target a ... and when I look at the at at the response which you had and which I've seen from other people are when Brock Obama was an office\nUm in in the case of the shooter they shot a ... um the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders\nBut what you see here and I find this so hard is that ah these devices have been put out there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan covertly to put these things in place all at once\nAnd none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there\nBut the organization of their rhetoric is so disgusting ... on the political chain that\nIt it does make one pause and ask 'em or was this rhetoric prepared it's a it's a very alarming thing ...\nWas a I got Daniel you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president today I think that there is\nBlamed the light across the\nEntire political state trying and what I think\nRegular people like me the as I Do that in the world I deal with people who I don't necessarily agree with I get my job's done I jobs that I I Would hide and somehow I managed to get around the world and get around this country to get around the city I without inflaming tensions at the people around me and I just don't understand\nWhat is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is done without this kind of inflammatory rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of\nVitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says fake news a lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary\nClogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see that and much real\nReporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by\nLiberal activists George Stephanopoulos as an agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton's ruined through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit\nAnd it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels and you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example\nBut we've added Obama when no one else would we would vetted the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media and so that's part of what we do giving opinion is part of what we do we're like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean ...

[noise]\nWelcome back for the Mars Lawrence on the show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Thursday night and on the phone\nWith me right now is Andy McCarthy Andy I Love having you on because of your depth of knowledge as the prosecutor put the blind shaken prison\nYou know the federal law and I and\nI we also appreciate the grand jihad how Islam and the life sabotage America or you can find a way to end the rights of National Review but Andy I'm going to get your take on on where uh what do you think is driving\nThis bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were devices sent to a total of ten different addresses now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America ...\n... ... well I think was that the abandon with which the media got out in front of what we know about the sensitive which so far is not a whole lot um it was really\nA staggering to me I mean the the trends parrots determination to try to make this about Trump and even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggests that Trump's a\n... sort of inside it this or that his rhetoric um is so unique and uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling I'll have a\nPiece coming out on a column coming out on National Review about this tonight but you know just when you when you move out of the world of political\nUh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and get into the real world of like prosecutions in the courtroom and a jury\nCommon people's common sense I'm\nMost normal people understand that nobody\nGoes out and commit mass murder attacks on the basis of anything they hear it a political rally no matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorists behavior to suggest that it's driven by ...\nOr something along those lines it's just foolish ...\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say give all of the bombs were sent to people\nWho were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clintons the Obamas and to CNN I guess it's not a far jumped to\nSay well maybe it is politically oriented whereas if it had just been random targets are kind of like uh the the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski than you might say well we we don't know what's driving him except that apparently hates technology\n... yeah well I I'm not at all\nHesitant about that last I think that we're now at a\nRipe enough point in what's been learned about the investigation that we can clearly said as a political motivation here yeah um but we would be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not\nAnd whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my faith is not that you draw a conclusion that something's politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggest that the president's guilty if incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America is actually a convicted\nOr people or at least one person of incitement in court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult proof in the courtroom as it should be because\nWe have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political\nWell as it should be because\nWe have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech um but you know court ruled proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally regardless of how skilled the demagogue\n... or ... or ... you know some other skills speaker ... at a rally may be and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up and they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us and doing to our country nobody leaves from that to say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit\nMass murder attack well and maybe they'll decide to go rings a doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and it showed up some\nOr you know a bomb people into a ... a into oblivion oh well\nThere there might even be people who say I went out and punch somebody in the face because I was so\nFar to but a political rally but then when you try to turn around and say hand it's not my fault I didn't actually cause it the person who riled up cause did that CNN buying into a a kind of I'm not responsible for anything it's the guy who was talking to me and saying words to me\nWho inspired me to do that and I look I Andy I've covered some cases they uh\nWhat was the one area and resistance case where a Tom Mets gr inspired people to go out and and be demand adept with baseball bats because he was black or I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say\nYou had to say I'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color\nAnd and they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that ... that held up on appeal but was CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's fault\nTwo days after the New York times published a uh uh uh some assassination pornography in the form of a fictional story about the assassination of Donald Trump\nAnd then there are calling for unity and and closing the the the divisions between is it's it's rank ... ...\n... yeah I look I I completely agree with that they look lost ... there's a doctrine of law\nCalled fighting words ... which is an exception to the first amendment\nUh it's it's over the years been cut back on an awful lot since the Supreme Court recognized as in Nineteen forty two and there's a lot of good constitutional law experts who think that it's a completely more up on a doctrine but what it basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful\nTo you and your presence and you know turn around and uh and\nAnd clocked me of on account of it um you know I have a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I\nInsulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say I'm the doctor and has been cut back on a lot\nIn recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attend a political rally and then you are you know you go away from the rally and you have some distance in terms of time and space\nTo think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act\nAnd we say it's the it's the fault of the person who's rally you went through that simply it it essentially says that you have no agency for your own behavior which is just ridiculous\nAndy I you know on the non lawyer near the lawyer but I've read that case a you know years ago because I I thought this is interesting if you walk into it\nWell Andy I you know on the non lawyer near the lawyer but I've read that case a you know years ago because I I thought this is interesting if you walk into a bar and say something so vile to a man about say his girlfriend or his wife that it could be the verbal equivalent of a punch in ... in the nose and you might arguably say for something that bad\nYou might you might get away with punching him back for his words but but I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician but I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder Maxine Waters Hillary Clinton\nYou know and some other allies like Madonna fantasizing about blowing up the White House that if they want to start going out in identifying people who said let's go out and do violence because of this presidency\nYou're going to find a lot more offenders on the left than you are on the right the right tends to be pretty ... law abiding I think mostly conservatives are but where do you think there's going to go we got about a minute left in this interview in\nI think they're going to capture the the person or persons behind this pretty quickly wars there's an awful lot of forensic evidence that they have and unlike when I investigated these cases Twenty years ago video is now ubiquitous so I I Would they do they'll capture this guy in very short order\nShould be interesting because it's awfully tough to route rap those packages\nIn tape without leaving your fingerprints in your DNA all over it and of course having a courier\nNow you've got you've got Christian businesses getting sued into bankruptcy 'cause they won't take part in same sex marriages\nFree political speech the left used to be for that now if what you say make someone feel unsafe the government can step in and arrest you for it and finally how about the idea of academia seeking objective truth and letting a free range of opinions you know be on campus even if it hurts people's feelings because that's how we find the truth\nNow they're they're silencing free speech on campus on all those things the left walked away from the American consensus and embraced extremist views and now they're screaming at us for being fanatics because we still believe what we did when Ronald Reagan and\nGeorge Bush and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton that Harry Reid all agreed on all these things we didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed to now let me ask you something since you and I are on the same page on just about everything every time I've talked to John I'm Talking to John's mirror from the stream and you've got to read this piece he's written um\nIf we were to draw just as hard as you and I could could we come up with any kind of similar ... list or something like it I Know you\nI don't believe in the artificial moral equivalency where Lutz liftoff befall to both sides but\nIf you tried to find out is there anything that the right has walked away from where it was on the same page as the left Thirty years ago\nI Can't think of a single thing honestly\nNow I Know what I'm thinking of single thing when we were not calling for America to be a monarchy or a Christian government\nWe're not calling for people will be put in internment camps were not calling for\nRacial supremacy you were not doing any of the crackpot things that\nThey are accusing us of there they were just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacists evil heterosexual heterosexuals patriarchy patriarchal monstrosity so the laugh to move the goalposts out of the stadium\nAnd they're calling us lunatics 'cause we're still in the fifty yard line\nNo do you think that some of those divisions caused by one side walking away from the consensus points is what's causing all of this turmoil lately violence and the streets bombs sent to a bunch of of liberals a political liberals and we don't know how many more may be on the way those are delivered in the mail do you think\nSome of that is because we're we're putting Americans in a ... in a position where the two major political forces in the country ah one has walked away from the table and those dozen or so items and and that leads people wondering well\n... than what am I supposed to do a riot when they're no longer consensus\nAlso I mean the the ... another item of consensus is when you lose an election you accept that yeah\nBut but the left didn't accept ... even that Obama and I know that much in two thousand eight was supposed to be a permanent fundamental transformation of the country ... the the election twenty sixteen that was supposed to be a formality like an election in East Germany where you just certify with the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary Leslie outraged this was supposed to be a permanent\nYeah a formality like election in East Germany where you just certify what the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary\nLeslie outraged this was supposed to be a permanent irreversible revolution under Obama so they really think that they're under foreign occupation by foreign enemies that's why they have to have a resistance resistance is what you're doing the Nazis occupy your country not win Ohio votes against you\nWell and I know this happened when I was a little kid and you weren't even born John but\nWhen Nixon you know said okay I'll concede the race there were folks who said no no we could fight over this winter we could win this one you know because there was probably cheating on both sides there were certainly cheating on the Democratic side he said for the good of the country I'll do that I think that's what the left thought was going to happen in two thousand with Gore and Bush\nAnd they failed and that drove them crazy and lately that that
