the whole night\nYeah and one thing to and then you've got to look the the raptors had seven player scorn double figures that's the way that we just have to play they're like well\nYou know John and bread all stars are fantastic players they're wonderful players all star players and you know no one's going to deny that\nBut the wizards are not going to be any good if they're not playing a team ball for if everybody's not getting their opportunities it's gonna be hard for them to compete especially you know it I think that's what happens a lot of times when you aren't getting touches when you are feeling like you're in a rhythm offensively from the defense of venue slip\nBecause you don't feel like you're involved or you're engaged and I think that that happens sometimes\nYou know the other strategy committed to a game like this where you got to see this play three games or four nights coming off it back to back to where I don't know why\nYou want to push the wizards they try to push to get some fast breaks yes but\nYou also want to be complete defense and\nWhen you make a team play defense you moved the ball you you you move all around the perimeter wizards it was a lot of you know picking roles yeah you know which is you know to some degree predictable yet and it was one pass end up you know I think there's a lot of stress on this team to try to shoot as many threes as you want when you do that\nYou're thinking three you know I don't think call Larry was thinking three took threes yeah everyone to the basket yeah um\nYou know so my point is is she put team down on the in the defense of said they'll get tired yes and the wizards didn't do that\nAnd I also think this is no matter what no matter who was on the court you know this is Ron oh this is the team that beat you in the playoffs last\nThey didn't do that and I also think this is no matter what no matter who was on the court you know this is Ron oh this is the team that beat you in the playoffs last\nNo matter who's on the floor on that team that should have been enough motivation to come out and like you know we want to let you all know where he writes mash back\nJust face yeah cause they they're already vulnerable their best player not around this is your opportunity to come out in the lesson okay you've got your back on here but we don't let you know when he comes back he don't he don't give somebody has to do right now it's around like\nWorried about is why we'd be without court we'd be Michael\nAnd it let me tell you something the way that play with ... right now oh listen\nWhat they've done is they've added to elite\nDefensive player ...\nHawaii daddy green yes okay who also could score by that we're headed reputation pedigree so what they also have done Toronto from what I've seen this year before this game it was quiet and play this game\nFirst option an office ... second option ... third wife yeah who's what they've done is they've spaced everybody out we didn't see it as much tonight but we did a little bit with with\nHow Lowry the space you out and they go one on one they go to Iraq and then they find guys yes so this is a tough team it is and\nI think a game like this can only give them confidence down the road they know that it is if this is why first second third option they can still win if he's having a ... night right because they can carry him because they've proven that can live without him right so I think that that's the one thing that that if you're the wizards you kind of want to leave\nLeave some hint of doubt in your head up with next time you see you next time they see them they were like All right these are these guys don't have to really worry about\nIt couldn't be this on the second ... back to back without our

have underestimated the Milwaukee box a little bit yeah I think so so I'm gonna I'm gonna say that you know the wizards aren't going to finish top three but I definitely see this is a playoff team or maybe they don't get to forty nine but I I think they're going to push close to fifty once where all said and done I think\nIt's possible I think it's possible look you know the paper look you've got to get back in the ... got to get back in the mix right um\nYou know it's funny\nThink about what we've seen the last two days what do we need to be\nNeed rebounding you'd need rebound there what is Dwight Howard do yeah he's going to clean up that defense of glass\nYou see is yes is this is very important so look you know um [noise] it's it's tough I mean it's it's it's a tough first who lost his but it's not a disease and it's not how it works and you know you hope this team learned from it do you think they can do whatever it is you\nIn olean to start is hardly damning especially considering if you go back just two seasons ago they started to win a\nA six insert team they were at and they ended up winning forty nine game right so a you know it it\nThe seasons ago they started to win a\nA six insert team they were at and they ended up winning forty nine game right so it you know it's some point you can turn it around and turn it around in a hurry if you start doing the little things that concern for me [noise] that I took away from tonight had more to do with the fact\nThe way they sort of blew up\nOn the officials in the\nFourth quarter was a very late third early for the fact that we're two games into the season\nIn things come busted the way it sort of did and it felt like the whole team just sort of imploded for two to three minutes right it felt like a team that was forty games into the season and frustrated with how things were going right for that to happen in game two with a little concerning to me that there's already that level of frustration\nYeah well you know um [noise] I agree with you\nIt shouldn't be that way right now and you have to learn from that you know\nOddly enough I don't think he's got a technical I don't think he got one today which is bizarre\nBut I mean you know what we saw the night as a team as a team you know you can't you can't lose it like that and it's got upset got upset Scott got tossed you know\nAnd if you just look at the ... you know when we talked two nights ago uh you know I sort of brought up how I just don't feel like this team\nHandles it well when the game gets very ... and there's a lot of breaks and the action and they can't find a rhythm\n'em and lo and behold the same exact sort of gained breaks out tonight and once again they seemed a little flustered once they weren't able to establish the flow next thing you know they're down Thirteen points and then once the whistle started to go away they came back and got right back into the game\nUm so you know I I think one of the things that you have to take away from this it's not just the rebounding it's not just the attention to detail and finding bodies when shots go up or finding bodies when there's a fifty fifty ball getting on the floor there also needs to be attention to detail and just you can't give up sheet south\nAnd you know let the other team in the bonus early in the quarter where it's going to turn into a stop choppy type game or because of this team is clearly dependent on the game having a rhythm having a flow for them to be their best version of themself\nTrue however you know you got teams like Golden State to lose it every seems like every seven minutes like that which are immigrating\nYeah but I I think worry the differences is Golden State offensively can score in any type of possession any type of game\nAnd I think the wizards when they don't have a rhythm or when the game turns into sort of\nThere's a stoppage the other defense is allowed to set up you have to run a half court set twenty seconds later there's another stoppage you're running against a half court set a defense it's already set up they don't function you know like Michael ... was talking a lot of the points then I came off of turnovers ...\n... it was a killer those those points off turnovers tonight\nI mean I guess that that's just what I mean in terms of\nThe wizards off and was it their best when they were able to get out and run able to you know a stab Alicia flow to the game they don't play as well off offensively when they have to play against is set up established half court defense right and that's what happens when you get into these games full of whistles\nSo you know cutting down on the south especially the hand checks the off fall south\nThat's something that you have to try and ease out\nIt's full of whistles so you know cutting down on the south especially the hand checks the ... south that's something that you have to try and ease out of the picture going forward\nYeah look and you know it's not the end of the world I'm way too early to pay its way way too early to panic to some degree I mean I I Wish the phones were working because I'm sure everybody would be calling up you know Henny Penny the sky is falling but\nYou know it it's not and this team can get it and\nYou know they got to find a way for they have to find a way to get more involved with this team that they got to find a way [noise] and one thing that a ... and I think this is what I'm going to say is there is directly related to this the bolted move that much it didn't go from side to side a lot\nAnd that's where adults can score\nAnd you know I Know it's got book said is you know like well he's got to find a way with and he does but they gotta you know you got to bypass the quick shot once in a while you gotta so\nThey've got to find a way he's too good of a player to be playing this way he just ...\nYeah I I again I think it's still I think a lot of it does go back to the fact though that\nThe ball swings a lot more and they do a better job of moving the ball when they are in a rhythm type ... I mean they I don't know how to describe it other than saying that this team needs to feel a flow to the game\n\nThanks for listening to today's special game time presentation of Charlottesville

twelve sixty WC age [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm ... years [noise]\nThis is montel joined a gym in if this is the the east side and they say [noise] why would a Jamie's versus say well yesterday was saving for say say ... thank you thank you thank you [noise] did you have a good day I had a great day would you do\nThat time with my wife and my children and we went to a museum as a lovely meal [noise] lots and we've been on my wife and I went on a date [noise]\nAwesome right well uh [noise] we are\nHappy to have Jamie here celebrating his birthday with us on Saturday Night and I are fantasy football and we're taking your phone call that eight five five to one to four\nTo two seven if you listen to our podcast you might know how old Jamie is\nFirst person to tell us first car to tell us that well Jamie is win the prize you lied apparently I I have said you were much older than you actually are that's eight five five to one to four to seven but if you recall somewhat recently on a pockets within the last few years we said like\nWe did something around one of your birthday is whatever I'm\nCBS is Super Bowl season continues Sunday would that Trump had her\nFirst live from London the titans take on the chargers then Tom Brady in the patriots coming up with really went over the chiefs I was an amazing game collide with the bears\nAnd then we got a big NFC East showdown between the cowboys and the Redskins wake up with the NFL today at nine am eastern six am Pacific and start your full day of football on CBS going to be a real fun day\nUh Jamie I'm going to give you some R B too is\nThe way you have them ranks NPR I'm just going to go down the list the way you have them re just give me a sentence or two about what you expect from them we're going to start at number eleven with to recall what everybody should do now\nDown the list the way you have them rank and just give me a sentence or two about what you expect from them we're going to start at number eleven which is a recount I won't want when everybody should do now is just thinking about how funny it is there's this is like eleven through twenty eight of these guys eleven through twenty in week seven\nAnd there are so unlikely so let's start to recount against the mainland real quick how you feel about I'm\nLoving this week fourteen catches his last two games are the better of the two bears running backs right now and I think there's either going to be a shootout or the bears chasing points against the patriots who have struggled the last two weeks with Ninety mines and cream hunt catching pass\nHow 'bout TJ yelled and against Houston\nA great situation for him again he's been very involved in the past and games average over five years precarious\nThe last two games and I think with uh the way that the Texans have struggled with past catching backs as well he will be a very good member to Gainesville against ISI was awesome catch them all yeah\nSo from Cohen the yellow than to carry on Johnson at Miami\nKnow theoretically yeah dolphins a prior to last week were six in the NFL\nAlign receptions running backs I think they're right in that range again\nSo just given what his role will now be as a rush her I think his touches go up without the over there so I'm a very excited about carry on John ... at the jets um as we saw last week you know when they committed to him and the office of wind look good\nA jets run defense has been suspect this year so heavy workload knowing that no Donald cook is there a I'm actually just in my ... now a little bit he's going to be moved up a couple spots\nOkay yeah the jets have allowed or five yards for Kerry will lead running back two weeks in a road map Brita against the rams\nOr didn't have any catches last week was a little bit surprising but uh fourteen carries with the season for him seems like the ankle is okay we know the rams have been or not the greatest against the run the they're statistically all the better I think than what they're run defense actually is\nAnd so given what his carries should be with a couple of catches on top of it\nEspecially if they're chasing points I I think he's a very safe number two running backs Kevin Coleman against the giants are very disappointing so far but you also look at who they played you know tough matchups against the saints they run the offense is good Steelers runny fence is actually pretty good uh bagels run defense is is so so but uh he had a ... game\nSo I think this is his uh hey I'm the guy for Atlanta rest of the season and we know that that's the role that he's going to have but primetime game he's going into free agency and the giants as we have been up and down against Iran\nWe got two more Corey climate against Carolina\nI think he was the better the two guys last week against the against um [noise] uh in their game last week giants yes or no or get forget about the touchdown take that away he looked better than when those small would I think adding knocked becoming often injury he would have had a lot more work than small wood so I'm just excited for his opportunity now that you should be healthy getting that heavy ...\nAnd I said eleven to twenty we're actually going to Twenty one mark Ingram at Baltimore\nMakes a little bit nervous you know I Hope they get involved in the passing and like they did last year but the ravens ready fences great and he's going to share with ... so you're still starting in your him but you got to downgrade him and this is the spot to put them in\nOkay names I didn't mention in eleventh through Twenty one Sony Michel Philip Lindsey who is great on Thursday Nick Chubb who we've talked a lot about it's amazing what running back looks like in week seven and it could be awesome heckler\nPotentially ahead of all of these guys if Melvin Gordon out yep and let's get to the cause All right one question no greetings and oh isn't that you want to guess Jamie's age ah let's just gets it gets with many questions as we can hear a five five to one to forward to to seven let's do it as a and Marilyn go\nDetroit give up James why it only around and Mike for ... and ... and ...\nGo by [laughter] ah\nTrey give up James wide Antonio Brown and Mike for ... and ... and ...\nGot to go by [laughter] uh see I mean great players everywhere you know so you're giving up a lot you got to hold the back of his great\nUh and you've got ... the guy that we saw in those first four games or at least they got it we saw last year but I think you'll be okay um you know in in in the Philippines right but you get up to give up a lot you're getting a lot Andrew in Boston and Andrew go\nOn a guy who maybe are a started one how to carry on Johnson via a comment job though\nJust one I'm going to have is a ... ... ...\nAnd the people who are you okay a five five to one to four to two seven Tony in Pittsburgh Tony or an eye on fantasy football\nAre you doing guys a standard league three quarterbacks need warm Drew Brees also reverse ...\nA breeze I Know it's tough matchup against the ravens but I still think they're going to be able to score points against Baltimore through the air what don't you like about reverse I don't think that they're all very much now that changes it's gorgeous out but his pet stuff it's just been down\nYeah has been a thirty or fewer and for six games a five five to one to four to two seven to say in Chicago what up goose [noise]\nHey what's up guys Jamie I think you're forty one is not happy birthday anyways\nDon't Jamie don't say so the end of the segment Kay ... is our first guest All right [laughter]\nWell are you guys I just did a trade 'em I got a job and so now I'm In a predicament why start in a four point ... PR um carry on ... or James White I Need two of those three I've already started David Johnson unfortunately but hey what are you going to do that to go\nBy um [noise] well uh James wife for sure so and yeah ... I I like carrying on a little bit better if you're isn't shove a little safer yeah he he's probably going to get six more carries\nThe now we saw Reddick any game early disease I forget which gave me was I could look it up for you but Rick left in the middle of the game and carry on Francis I'd catch All right that's a cool that's cool though and now you're talking about no the already for the whole game I think this is already catches I ... I think we all my bleep carry on jobs is awesome\nYes and then next week that will be ... but yeah so I'm hoping so All right so the white and Johnson for you yes All right a five five to one down there was not as easy I Would say Cho okay Greg in Houston Greg what's up\nWhat's going on I was delighted birthday Jamie Vegas now I Know what to talk of the uh they said you were forty eight which has obviously is not right so I'm going to say he added ten years so phoney\nAnd I guess they're generally what you know David is older than me [laughter] that's true David I'm forty nine oh I'm thirty eight is against some Greg we'll let you all know at the end of the segment question sir\nOkay a tent saint Pete Pete hardly have yelled and Kamara levy on ... and caution and I'm trying to figure out what you do anything in terms of uh on the wave wired as jailing Sean Payton barber Aaron Jones a mall in fact\nI mean I'm not dropping any the guys you have you know it's like there's a reason that like what your drop Carson or something\nRestoring some confidence and self esteem and reaffirming their being taken seriously with an action plan that also helps if it happens again there's much more he's or dot org slash billion with dogs and family and we certainly\nSee bill sports Saturday means Virginia Tech hokey football Washington Nationals baseball and CBS Sports radio all on WC age ... am and FM Charlottesville [laughter]\nW.

just think there's a little bit of a higher stealing for him although dogs will be great\nOkay thank you and my next question as [noise] anyhow what what do you think you'd say Mike Williams are trapped around this machine is our Michael Thomas can you go and they and how he killed [noise]\nGreat group ah I think ... is your best bet a jaguars have had trouble with slot receivers and we are you know at least the word out of a Houston is that they want this on Watson understandably so to get the ball quicker so are you teaching the a lot of work near the last\nEight five five to one to four to two sevens the number down let me ask you a question for our last caller so cutie Michael Michael in particular looks a little drop a ball right now especially with the by coming up next week or you know if your main curses out there\nWell cutie Michael and Michael in some particular looks a little drop the ball right now especially with the by coming up next week or you know if your main curses out there would you drop Williams if cameras ... basically are known is out there or a trick want Smith would you drop Mike Williams would you make a move\nAbsolutely uh you know Williams at a couple of\nGood moments early in the season you know a couple of cases some great moments\nBut there are a lot of mouths to feed and that chargers often and he just doesn't get the target share that you'd like to see from somebody like what cursed did last week like what I think you're going to get from Meredith and check on Smith moving forward those are all in my opinion better options right now who's your favorite [noise]\nAh I think it depends on what you need so if you don't need to start any one right now I'm paying checkpoint Smith because if he becomes just this explosive especially when they're home type of guy that is illegal under a Meredith and curse I think will be a little bit safer but Smith is a home run\nBy a one Taylor Gabriel's out there oh that's easy tell you is your favorite of All right back to the phones and eight five five hundred went to ... yes Scotland still very ... should he should be Ninety percent of a five five to one to four to seven Allen's in

final segment after our break but first Jamie mess around eight players you tell me ... and quick explanation we haven't talked about these guys all that much\nAndrew Luck and very tough matchup against buffalo a start but he's a low in star locker breeze breeze okay and same thing with breeze right low in ... yep time had them ten ten to twelve in that range good Tom Brady at Chicago\nOr downgraded him to nine he was originally I think six so without rock and they're just a little bit of dumping\nAll right so we're starting Jane is Dalton over him yep okay a Adrian Peterson against Dallas\nLow in starter as well he's been very good for the majority of the season but the return of strongly makes me a little bit nervous to return Kris Thompson makes me a little bit nervous so uh I wouldn't run away from Peterson but I Would start yelled in a tape as Murray Nick Chubb a seven Coleman all those guys over\nDuke Johnson or Peterson CPR or do Johnson ooh All right uh the shah McCoy at Indianapolis or take the same thing I just said about Adrian Peterson and applied some quick Michael Crabtree against the saints\nAre low in starter as well um you know I I I think at this point

see a ... and the Dodgers\nWin a game seven in Milwaukee do want to give some love the council and the brewers they were great team to watch all year they reminded me of the royals and giants teams that one world series you could see the teen chemistry\nYou could see the connection to the manager and the only thing missing is that they won't get a World Series rang like that royals and giants organization got or organizations plural\nGreat playoff run man and now you get the Dodgers and the red Sox and do a lot of people out there was that all the good spirit to say that it was the host rose and the brewers Dodgers earned that Red Sox earned that\nYes major league baseball umpires or some of the worst in pro sports just like NFL referees but the game is still bigger than umpires bad ones and good ones\nJust like the NFL is still king when it comes to bad referees I just wonder why you don't see younger people and Bahrain Rafi now I get you know service to the league but at what point\nIs kind of like the NBA NBA as for the most part they have young guys in shape up and down the court and they seem to connect right you don't ... how many times do you see really bad MBA officiating you see it at the college level right in hopes\nOf college football officials that they'll have a tough time with the targeting definition just like the NFL does but I I think they do a pretty good job for the most part because they don't become a lot of storylines\nIn college football I you know\nOn fires referees officials are there to interpret the rules of the game and we know their names and we know angel Hernandez and we know I don't want to know their names I don't I don't watch a game I don't know it it was how they missed interference in Houston\nI I don't think that changes series because at Boston line up with those bats they are just scary so Boston earned it Dodgers aren't no excuses\nCan't point a finger of your brewers fan camp born a finger if you're an Astros fan\nRed Sox have a line up\nTheir pitching stepped up price and a lot of doubt\nThat he was just cashing in and he delivered and now we're going to get a pretty darn good World Series that will begin on Tuesday at Fenway Park in Boston and I would think that this isn't the same\nGood World Series that will begin on Tuesday at Fenway Park in Boston\nAnd I would think that this isn't the same Dodgers team they're scrappy like you look at their payroll and it's almost like they've had the play through injuries and over achieve\nAnd that Red Sox lineup is filled with youth with veterans with power I just don't unless the Dodgers pitching staff has just lights out I don't know how you don't pick the red Sox to win at all so we'll talk more and we'll get your pick\nIn the world series so that's one of our questions of the night also each and every Saturday Night on CBS Sports radio reach out all across America even to our college football fans in Canada and we do the CBS eyeball test your top four teams in college football at this hour\nNow I don't think it's too hard\nTo night even with Ohio State getting rolled by per do\nYes they quit quit they lay\nDown I don't know both set aside and that he's not going to play\nI don't know of Meyer coming back was that the team wanted them I I don't know but they're not the same Ohio State they aren't they laid down in the night in West Lafayette, Indiana number two team in America\nJust quit just like boats to quit I Know but I don't have a problem with that\nHe has a core muscle injury chances are that when the hill and he's going to be a potential top pick in the NFL Draft in the spring and two thousand and Nineteen and with all the millions that Ohio State makes off of bows and Ohio State football that kid not kid young man\nAdult can choose to leave he'll get ready to make millions in the NFL I don't have an issue with it\nBut Ohio State quit I mean that's the same field we're eastern Michigan University beat Purdue eastern\nMichigan University and by the way they have a pretty good football team in the middle American Conference\nBut I'm watching that and the way the flag and just waiting to flag\nThey quit a summer cold it's colder there the Ohio State university not the University of the Bahamas\n\nSo right now it's easy with fellow shoe beating number twenty to Mississippi State it's easy to look at

I'm not really concerned I I think that people you know can panic and things are cyclical people come down\nThings that the Republicans normally support like free trade are not are kind of in doubt so that's putting a lot of pressure the economy's doing well\nJust when we had got an unemployment down to under three percent and now all of a sudden growth will stop because investors have lost faith we should all be concerned\nThat is really some real worry there for a real estate market\nI've seen the effects of the real estate market in the last couple of months it's changed radically sales

Eighteen throughout their weight in age and they are arguing for an Eighteen playoff right\n... thank God just like Bob our coffers\nActually not Eighteen throughout their weight age they are arguing for an Eighteen playoff back I don't think I'd just like Bob our copper cat does anybody on late night for the national game like\nThank you Steve and in Knoxville, Tennessee where the ball's fans witnessed the greatest softens in college football and ... maybe one of the best you've ever seen in Alabama earlier this afternoon a set of last year that you know there's not a lot of arguments after eight there is\nI mean if the if you looked at everything right now and you went okay Alabama climbs into if we just looked at the ranking so we have right now Alabama Clemson\nLSU Michigan\nGeorgia Oklahoma Texas\nAnd I I don't know if I put central Florida there I I get the the story and what they've done and it's kind of Boise State issue and I don't want to demean the blue turf and the great program for our listeners in Boise but when you look at the power five I I just don't know\nIf you can slide central Florida and because of the obese yes well they're undefeated like Notre Dame is undefeated they bite Alabama but they weren't any good time so if he did an Eighteen play off off the top twenty five\nFrom what I project will be this week which will be Alabama one climbs into and the three LSU for Michigan five Texas six Georgia seven Oklahoma aids\nYou have UCF than\nKnocking on the door with a one loss of Ohio State team in Florida at eleven see that the the argument goes away what you're going to get now and then that's what I said earlier my opening huge opinion\nThat there's got to be that one last debate and I'm getting people tweeting me had Saturday huge well there's no way the SEC gets two teams in I just told you how\nIf Alabama is undefeated playing in the SEC title game in Georgia would beat them in Georgia that hasn't lost another game and the real one last team those to one last teams will be in the college football playoff\nA guarantee so the question is if you're in that one law is sharing category well issue controls are destined because if they went out there in I I don't think Michigan has that control now that Ohio State was upset by Purdue\nIn Penn State was beaten last week by Michigan State\nTaxes now I don't think they control their destiny of the college football playoff neither does Oklahoma\nGeorgia does because if they would win the rest of their games and you know number low in Florida in their annual robbery game they would have Kentucky they've whatever Alabama they they have they have their past as one last team UCF does\nNo great story\nBut it's not worthy of being in the final four now if we had an Eighteen playoff they would be in that conversation\n\nThan the power if I could be taken care of that you're conference championship winters they are in regardless so now you put a lot of value in the regular season and even more value into conference championship games because the guarantees of birds\nNot waiting on a committee not wondering about strength of schedule you rewarded power five\nIt guarantees a birth not weighed in on a committee not wondering about strength of schedule you rewarded power five then there's three other spots where Notre Dame would come into play\nAnd then you get those two spots to debate there you go Eighteen\nPlayoff simple make me an see doubling commissioner okay there you go and I'll cleanup college basketball as well\nWould you do

[laughter] yeah\nI so what else is then we bring ourselves to your farm the farm sure one of the reasons there there are several reasons I wanted to tell stories like this the fact that younger people are getting into farming or staying in the farming when we hear the stories you may have heard me talking before you went on the air but the problems the older farms and farmers are having\nA just moving their bills so it doesn't look attractive to a lot of younger people why did it look attractive to you it's it's refreshing it's good to have you bring the new bloody and but how did you figure you could make a go of it\nHow I don't know I think I I've always been interested in that without going to be my work but you know the level it is and you figure out a way to do it and it's you know like all states had an important characters\nI it's Iraq like we just figured we needed to be creative and figure out how exactly we crappy that's acceptable farming\nFor in your life and I it it's a rare right we just figured we needed to be creative and figure out how exactly we could be a successful farm and that doesn't mean you know it gets growing wheat and selling the berries after tired until value added product or yeah luckily I\nOr the train bigger than ... you know just figured out how to make it all work together\nYeah so what else do you have on what else do you have on your

'cause we are fortunate well off in Charlottesville and we've got to a nation recognized and university here and lots of thriving businesses and a growing city\nAnd all that but but it is at a ... both geographically and otherwise Appalachians pretty much on our doorstep it's not that far away yes would you agree absolutely and culturally\nNo I mean you go a U.S Fifteen miles from where we're sitting in the green county and be in the deepest hours of applicants\nYeah All right so you um you say there's some negative forces that attempt to block luck out our daily lives will just give his briefly because I Want to get back to uh the couple you know you mentioned earlier but I think\nOut our daily lives with just give us briefly 'cause I Want to get back to a couple of you know you mentioned earlier\nBut I think there you're looking at issues like health care mhm people who\nHave chronic illnesses especially\nThat block their development as people and one of those stories I go back to in my own mind and then take across as far as what the human being is capable Mm is you look at the story of Israel yes and how\nWill it swept in now probably Seventy five years ago or whatever it was nothing but a little blocks of sand in the desert and\nAnd within a matter of ten or Fifteen Years it became a flourishing agricultural area exporting and so on and so forth\nThat's with the human being can do the human being can walk on the moon ... the human being can run\nAs fast as something fast and uh and the\nUm human being is capable of so much since about organ transplant that we've developed things like that and yet and it's not that we all start a game of monopoly with five hundred dollars or whatever it is yeah everything's equal yes and then along the way those people who start with the largest\nDisadvantages usually stay in the worst disadvantage so you've got schools graduating kids from high school who are illiterate yeah these kind of situations that I think we\nCan all think of many of them yeah and it's not just a thing of oh somebody should have more you're denying all of us\nYes ... that's right they can make a contribution and we're not getting it we're not getting their perspective and their contribution because they're being limited in in all the ways that you mentioned financially health and\nUm I you started this story I Know is about John and Maria and you mentioned Lynchburg and you met them at the blue ridge area food bank\nAnd fruit of Little Rock Jerry I met them after a parting okay which they had just moved into\nAnd she's in a wheelchair I tell us something of how we're speaking of how people limit other people their family kind of turn their back on them when they needed the most\nAbsolutely they were in Oklahoma\nMaria had been in a a severe car accident in which neither vehicle had insurance and so the hospital of course fixture enough to keep her alive and so on\nBut she was she spent her life in a wheelchair the emergency care that our healthcare system does not extend into rehab and what is there an available ... Maria could not have\nThey realize that uh this was not a good situation their families both of their families rejected them\nBecause they thought that this was just an inappropriate or ... ... and so Maria has a father in Lynchburg mhm so she decided to go to Lynchburg from Oklahoma tickets on a greyhound\nAnd you know several days going across the country\nYou can imagine every time a she wanted to get on or off in their stop John had to manipulate with the ah wheelchair and get her on and off and that's kind of the story it's a full time job for him yeah taking care of her\nThey got two inch burg and her father said who are you basically ... so they had made all this trip for nothing and they're they are with nothing it was the winter they spent four nights\nMm So they had made all this trip for nothing and they're they are with nothing\nIt was the winter they spent four nights sleeping on the street ... in the snow was a snowy time these people really got it yeah and then they did or you were gotten in contact with a social service agency that helped them and part of what they did was to get them a\nGetting services from the blue ridge a or a food bank\nWhich I was doing some work with\nAnd um they were able to get an apartment which is I explain they had basically one piece of furniture and that was the one thing though that they did have that was very very touching\nWas liberty student would come by once a week and it was part of his community service that he would come by once a week this kind of be with them yeah hang out with them and so on\nInformation you should\nUse roast persuading [noise]\nIt's not so unusual for parents to provide some financial support to their children to help them get started in life\nBut a recent study shows the dollar amount of parental financial support has exploded here to explain his ... CEO and founder of age wave which code develop this study with Merrill Lynch\nCan tell us what's your research showed as to how much support parents are giving their kids annually now\nWell ... we've always known the parents you know support and provide a lot of care and love and financial backup to children to toddlers I mean that's just considered sort of normal that's just part of the exercise but\nWhen we saw how much that was calculated to be back in the Nineteen sixties the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen was twenty five thousand dollars\nToday the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen is two hundred and thirty thousand dollars which is a lot yeah\nBut the real kind of shocker came when we went beyond the Eighteen year olds there's been a lot of talk Chris the last ... years about boomerang kids and the idea that are twenty five or thirty year old because of the high cost of rental housing and paying down college debts\nAnd you know inability to kind of get launched a lot of those kids they're living with their parents and we found that indeed that is true\nThirty one percent of all Americans between the ages of Eighteen and thirty four are living with their parents which is the most common living arrangement among early adults more people do that to live with a spouse roommates or by themselves\nBut what really knocked us out of our seats was we began to calculate beyond that you know having your child sort of in your house and you're providing\nGroceries and maybe letting them watch your Netflix we found out that there were five hundred billion dollars in addition spent by parents on their adult children subsidizing their cell phone bills rental costs helping to pay down debt\nSending them modifications which turned out to be twice as much as what those very same people were putting into their retirement accounts which was two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year\nYeah I was going to ask about how that compares to the retirement numbers so it seems like a lot of parents may be sacrificing their retirement years to keep their kids going\nSince a study launched some of the reflections are have worked with those kids do they even realize that they're taking so much from their parents other people have said hey you know what\nParents seem to like it it's sort of you know the next stage of the helicopter and hovering wanting your kids to be competitive to live comfortably to be happy\nTo get the best shot at a good life but the concern is that those very same well intentioned parents and maybe even well intentioned kids\nCould be jeopardizing their own retirement security\nBecause if you have on average seven thousand dollars a year going out to each child throughout their young adult years that's a lot of money and many of those very same people can't even afford their own bills\nAnd their own retirement savings building that nest eggs so to take so much of their resources\nAnd continue to support their kids is worth of discussion\nWe're talking with Ken ... CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids\nCEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study that reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids we're talking about millennials kids here I think what age range or the parents who are contributing all this money or these boomers primarily or younger\nIf we're looking at what are called early adults which you're Eighteen to thirty four year olds that side of the Census Bureau and sociologist categorize that the parents are going to range anywhere from forty to about Seventy\nSo they're boomers and Gen x ers often in the peak of earning years of their lives so they might be feeling kinda flush but on the other hand we know that about half of those people have almost nothing save for their own retirement so\nIt may be short sighted for so many people and by the way Ninety two percent crash of parents are providing some subset of the nation of the early adult children so it's not just middle income it's not just high net worth it's not people who are modestly resource it's kind of everyone\nThis has become the new normal and we have never before in American history and maybe world history\nSeen a situation like this I Know I was born in Nineteen fifty one I was growing up when you turn Eighteen or twenty or\nGraduated school you're pretty much on your own right and in fact if you ask for money a handout from your parents I always something you were a little bit ashamed of and you work in a live at home with your parents 'cause ours parachuting today\nIt's become quite normal and it's hard to know if these parents are empowering their kids by helping them out or as they say and ...\nAnd therefore weakening them but this discussion has got to be had this is a new phenomenon these young people are taking a little bit longer to get launched and their parents had generously are trying to help them along the way but they may not be able to really afford it\nCan't why do you see millennials struggling to launch you know their own lives is it because of student loans or is it the cost of living in the rent cost in major cities is there a single factor there\nI think there's a few forces one of them is that back in the Nineteen sixties the cost of a public college was about five hundred dollars per year for tuition now it's about ten thousand\nCosts for a private college back then was about three thousand dollars a year now it averages thirty five thousand dollars a year we've been worried about the cost of automobiles or gasoline going up but there's been no big outcry over the fact that tuition for colleges has just been skyrocketing\nAnd so for a lot of young people who want to get ahead they have to take out loans by the way more girls take out loans and boys because more\nYoung women are graduating college than guys are so that's number one very expensive number to those college loans can be three four hundred dollars a month every month on top of that bourbon environments housing it's become extremely expensive\nAnd so here he's got these twenty five and thirty year olds who are straddled often with college debt\nThe other thing that's happening with these young people\nIs it they actually get along really great with their parents\nBack for example an earlier era that might have been one TV set and the few telephone so people kind of how to share if they lived in a home now a young person can live and their mom and dad's home maybe help with the chores they can go in their own room and watch Netflix if that's what they like and they can come and go as they please\nSo it's become more accepting unacceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kind of like to help out\nFor more accepting unacceptable for young people to live with their parents and guess what a lot of the parents say they kinda liked to help out that may be just the biggest challenges weaning them off of this idea of continually helping their kids\nAs it is a challenge to have these kids kind of get their umbilical cords cut and get out on their own\nDo you have any advice for parents who might be listening who are thinking hey maybe I Do need to cut back is there an easy way to do that\nI think it's a series of discussions first of all I think if it's a single parent or there's a couple parents to stop and say oh this heard this program let me make sure I understand what's going on here are we doing that or yeah we are can we afford to\nAnd women is the exit strategy you're going to come into play we talked to young people in focus groups and they said well yeah parents pay your phone bills in your health bill in your car insurance that's just what parents do so they didn't think that they were being mean by asking for that they start that's part of the parent project\nSo to answer your question I think parents need to think seriously and responsibly about what they can afford it they don't ultimately wind up in trouble financially and having to be a burden on those very same kids is\nThat they're trying to be so kind to and there needs to be discussions between the generations\nOn top of that in our study Ninety percent of greed that financial education should be taught at high school a lot of the parents were saying you know we try to teach our kids were not even exactly sure how to teach 'em in this modern age\nAnd social media is having a big impact on them there needs to be some standard basic level of financial education so people can learn about managing debt and the value of compounding and living within your means which is no longer that certain out there in our life so\nA combination of taking stock drawing boundaries not just cutting your kids off tonight but developing sort of a game plan so that in one year or in three years and making sure the kids get that and then being sure that they've got the financial education to be able to make wise decisions\nCan die called CEO and founder of age

affect me if I were to return Elise car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you own money on our signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and are there are no repossession lot\nAnd then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference of media\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off

Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\nSo four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot to the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that and so you borrow and

the inside and so what happened is Jesus the father sent Jesus his son to earth\nAnd Jesus with that sacrifice a hung the cross\nHe became the only one that she covered the dead of our sins but it's interesting as we there's many scriptures um and I go through this in in the book that I wrote in one of the sanctions are to talk about the\nPower of the blood and the progression of Jesus blood and why it is available today what it does\nAnd it ... it Clint is is it for give this from the dead of our oceans\nBut then to mediate we promotes us and the and accelerates us to a face to face relationship with God and and in the Old Testament there was that veil that separated where the ... and wearing God works in as soon as Jesus\nDied upon the cross that they always rent and what he was saying I Am opening up the door for you to come before God in heaven\nI was actually just teaching on this verse last Sunday in church and as I did I taught about how I Can't get an appointment with the mayor in my city\nHowever in my quiet time every day every time I pray I can go boldly before God's throne of grace\nHowever in my quiet time every day every time I pray I can go both be before God's throne of grace it's absolutely amazing\nAnd that's mind blowing to some of us who are newer to the face\nTo really step in with boldness and realized that we have quote unquote direct access now we have direct access to the throne of grace and mercy and if he just wrapped year wrap your hands around that wrap your head around that direct access to the God of the universe\nThrough Jesus it's unbelievable and that's again one of the\nThe reasons why we we started this program is to help kind of share the news for people that maybe we're outside of the faith people who are growing with their faith to really kind of understand that part than the importance of direct access and what Jesus has done for us\nYou know and it's absolutely amazing and I take the word every day fate and you can say every day day and night you have access to God you have access to stand before me oh you have to do is to believe it's amazing an absolutely amazing\n... let me let me try to tie this verse to another verse that um that just kind of bubbles up for me and this is everyday faith radio our guest today is my good friend and mentor Ben Atkins\nAnd then uh the apostle Paul obviously was one who was anointed and heard from God and he was anointed in a pointed to share the gospel\nUm but one of the things that he talks about is the sink counter that he had with God where he had the thorn in the flesh you know the verse you probably know the ... by heart but can you have someone\nIn the flush and ask God three times to remove the stillborn in the flush and maybe you can touch on exactly what the thorn in the flesh was but anyway the the punch line that I'm getting too is where\nGod says to ah the apostle Paul he says my grace is sufficient for the ... and and my my power is made perfect in your weakness\nDo you mind just kinda go in a little bit on that versus maybe time the two together\nSure absolutely and for those that have Bible they can just turned a second Corinthian

and prosperity radio the weekly radio news magazine that we put together here at the Virginia Institute for public policy the clock is ticking towards the mid term elections\nBut we continue to look beyond so transient things as elections into a longer term but elections have\nDefinite side effects or impact areas and the Supreme Court has been one that was promised in twenty sixteen and I certainly has been borne out so we begin now that the dust settled on the Supreme Court nomination then nomination ugliness of\nA now justice Brett Kavanaugh a with Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation a and talk a little bit about the impact\nThat Brett Kavanaugh's vote may have on the Supreme Court going forward Hans welcome back to freedom and prosperity radio how are you sir\nI'm doing great just it's it's terrific to talk to you again\nWell thanks so much uh again I don't think this country has seen\nIt the level of acrimony that was on display in the Supreme Court nomination a battle over Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I understand that there is a lot at stake but is it being overplayed how much Brett Kavanaugh's vote in the Supreme Court will make a in replacing Justice Kennedy\n[noise] well I think it was greatly over played by the left of either way they were talking it was as if the the sky would\nFall in got good for ya I looked at the short way of summarizing the difference is that we we have gone from having an\nInconsistent conservative and Justice Kennedy to I think a more consistent\nConservative with with a judge Kavanaugh and\nLook in the majority of cases it's not going to make a difference I mean it it give you a quick example of this last spring court which was a very significant term you know we had a\nVery important decisions on a people not being able to be forced into a unions we had a record upholding\nThe so called travel ban to the president had had put out a we had the masterpiece cake shop case uh concerning uh Baker in Colorado are being forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding in all of those cases I'm Nineteen of them\nA matter of fact there are there were five these were all five four decisions that are written Nineteen cases in the last year there were five four decision in every single one of them justice\nKennedy voted with the conservatives so you know if Brett Kavanaugh had been on the court said exactly the same thing\nThe vast majority of cases Justice Kennedy would agree with the conservative certainly on First Amendment issues Second Amendment issues the places where he would side with the liberals\nIs this really something where the last\nFour ... all appropriate reasons needs to go back to legislating the way they're supposed to which is bring a bill forward see who supports it and then try to get that pass through much has been made about roe versus Wade in on one of the big problems in our country is that we've never legislated\nOr about abortion we've just a wild the courts to make rulings about it um and and it maybe it's because of the left doesn't believe they have enough votes to legislate\nConstitutionally these things up but what we see perhaps the left\nOr go back to try to make these things all the way they did with the Affordable CARE Act at least\n[noise] well they might they might if a depending on what happens to the mid term elections but look you you've actually put your finger on why uh for example Brock Obama put such a liberal I'm a a judge's it at a federal court\nUm what the left is very frankly they're very anti democratic and what they've been doing now for decades is when when they know that they can't convince state legislators or Congress where they know they can't convince voters\nTo go their way on particular social issues particularly laws they want um they have used the ... alternative\nTo go their way on particular social issues particularly laws they want um they have used the ... alternative venue of the courts\nTo try to get that imposed by judicial the out and unfortunately they've had very liberal justices who have judges who helped them do that but it is it isn't very anti democratic process um it's it's using the courts when they know they don't have support 'em\nThrough the legislative process to get done what what they want to get done and I I I think they're going to continue to do that because while Donald Trump is filling vacancies on the court\nNeal a lot of very liberal judges around the country and we've seen that in the last two years in the kind of crazy decisions we've seen coming out of the courts on everything from the travel ban to sanctuary policies\nIs that a dangerous precedent though because I feel like as they push that agenda harder\nOn the street you know the citizens feel less and less like those justice and I and I wonder if the rhetoric they used to try to push judges into making decisions favorable to their policies is actually creating an environment where the vox pop Eli is is losing faith in the justice system\nOh I think that's very much happening and um look ... you can see how much the public now understand how important judges are um if you look at the polling remember after the two thousand sixteen election it turned out that\nFilling that seat on the U.S Supreme Court that was actually an important issue we're in the polling do a lot of voters ... I don't think that ever happened in our history\n... voters worth worth thinking about who was going to be a Supreme Court\nWhy I Can't recall a presidential candidate making as big a deal about it as Donald Trump did and and that's through the credit to his advisors or or perhaps he himself you know came into it saying hey this is this is an important thing that the president is going to have to do\nA little the voters know about it because rarely does that kind of stuff get brought up and and usually it's brought up by somebody who's considered like a one or two percent candidate who's just\nBringing up ... points for folks like you and me to get in dry stuff ... never never does become popular we discussed around barbecue pit\nNo and and you you we just we just saw it again and we may see that again because I'm look the polling from a couple of months ago\nShowed Democrats rolling into big victories in these upcoming midterm elections all over the country and the most recent polling or over the past month\nShows a reversal of that and it seems to be tied to the shameful spectacle that the Democrats created in going after Brett Kavanaugh with false charges and going after him personally and that may have backfired\nVery big on the Democrats will see what happens in November but but I think they made a major mistake and again\nThis upcoming election may have been affected by the Supreme Court\nWell and you bring up a great point and this was a surveyor I forget the young lady's name and I should remember and she's been on the program or they did the book on who was voting for Trump\nAnd went out and saw doubt that twenty percent of Obama voters that voted for Trump in so much of what they said was we were really incapable of voting for Hillary Clinton and and I'm seeing in sensing that and then these poll numbers ... do you see that as well where people start looking at these\nYou incapable of voting for Hillary Clinton um and and I'm seeing in sensing that and then these poll numbers ... do you see that as well where people start looking at these\nMembers of the house and and or candidates for the house who are engaging in the in this political version of me to uh and and saying I I Can't support that that's not what I'm I'm looking for in my in the sense of fairness\nOr as a human says that that's just not what I Want my congressional representative to do a so if anything he's done turned that same thing down into congressional races like I Can't vote for that person\nOh I think we are seeing that I think the polling shows that and I think I think the visual images that America ... saw of these screaming\nOr rude to I'm a outrageous protesters during the cabinet hearing that they saw Senate Democrats and actually members of the house to encouraging\nAnd applauding that kind of behavior and I think voters are looking at going we don't want people like that in Congress or they they are the American public doesn't like that kind of behavior and again I I think it's really hurt or the Democratic push a ... in this election\nAs as a parent Hans I Know when my kids would throw a tantrum it was because they wanted something in their mind they wanted it very very badly\nI Do think that the American public is seeing the same thing in in the American left that these tantrums that they're throwing now uh we had a case in our flagship city we're an elementary school teacher in an effort to get the Confederate flag banned\nFrom um the hallways of a local school\nKept the police chief in the groin when they were being ejected from a meeting for disrupting at the end of you actually\nStealing other people's First Amendment rights\nI'm ... decided that kicking the police chief and the growing was the best way forward to it and that was complaining that he's being targeted judiciously of for his activism rather than his actions of kicking a police officer or it never mind where I guess just kicking them in general\nI mean this this behavior this tantrum throwing seems indicative to me of some some deeper need to have a substantive change in our American culture how badly they wanted and what are some of the things that they're looking for and the sons\nWell like all of these [noise] all of these individuals on the left you know they they have this particular view of this progressive utopia K. think America should\nBe met him and for all and yeah and\nAnd you can see that they really think that any tactics\nAny tactics are are are worth achieving that goal and you see that behavior I mean look ah we just what it was it over the weekend you saw a outrageous violent ... in Portland by this antifa movement which seems to think that\nThat anything you do against conservatives and others who disagree with you is is justified and again that is not the kind of civil behavior that Americans want to see\nAnd it's mob rule it's is we'll break your stuff if you don't share your stuff or give us your stuff or and ... how much worse do you think it's going to get 'em\n... before and starts to turn back around and and the the majority of Americans who I truly believe or a profound majority went out the day I mean\nWorry that this midterm election if it doesn't go the left way we're going to see a a ... a doubling of these efforts\nIt's already went out the day I mean I\nWorry that this midterm election if it doesn't go the left way we're going to see a a ... a doubling of these efforts\nNow I think it's going to get worse and and look like the cabinet or the cabinet episode I think is really one of the lowest points when most shameful points in the history of the U.S Senate but\nIf Donald Trump gets the look with Kevin uh like I said we were we were replacing a justice who was mostly conservative with a conservative justice if Donald Trump gets the opportunity\nTo replace a nother member of the Supreme Court a liberal member ...\n... you think it was bad ... this time it's gonna be or even worse if the left knows that whatever it is a liberal justice is going to get replaced with conservative I I don't think we've seen anything yet as bad as going to be when that happens\nWell certainly the a cult of Ruth Bader Ginsburg would the documentary about her life RPG a and that has ... certainly going on but she is now\nA gun on record saying she's going to hold on until twenty twenty but what if one of her health gets so dramatically or bad I think it was a story arc in the west wing where the chief justice was in a coma\nOr and they were trying to get him to resign but he kept coming in and out of his go what if what if Ruth Bader Ginsburg health become so bad that she can't continue as a justice but won't resign it because it would give them the opportunity to ah ah to replace the liberal lion\nBy getting them the technology but at the same time providing that that element of safety and reassurance\nI certainly understand that for a lot of people something like a driverless car may seem a little overwhelming and scary and so by establishing some guard rails so to speak for how we see this technology evolving\nBut allowing the testing where individual citizens can get more comfortable with it we think states like Arizona take a real leadership role\nExplained the phrase soft law because I Know that my interpretation of is probably is far off the bat uses it could possibly be but explain what you mean when you say softball\nSure so in some ways it's easiest to explain what ... is by explaining what it's not and that is that it's not hard law it's not a formal legislation is not formal administrative rule making that you would see from Congress or state legislature or even an administration agency\nIt's all those in between that say things like we encourage innovators to consider X.\nOr we think you should do why but at the same time not necessarily\nFormally and forcing a set of principles it's also seen when we see things like than boxing or working group\nWhere a state may establish certain guidelines um we've seen this with Pennsylvania's department of transportation that signal a willingness to innovators to provide the guidance that will\nGive a certainty to test and develop their program products but at the same time also giving them almost an invitation to discuss these guidelines to make sure that they\nWalked into a certain feature\nWhen asking middle aged adults and seniors to try brain training the response I'm most often get is my brains too old to train\nOr you can't teach an old dog new

there we're just to see what's out there it was the son of a set up by him to say was Peter bills but it was one of the big trucking\nA truck manufacturers and it was it looked like the cockpit of a truck\nA computer monitor screens all around what would the sins we'd be can be and it was driving a tractor trailer in the parking lot of the uh the convention center and what the point of it was was that instead of having a driver that has to stop every eight hours for some sleep\nAnd you're limited how long you can drive it with the drivers position being static and in one location number one the drivers liked it better because they had a home life and they add a nine to five job but the trucks actually we're more productive because all you would have to do is pull over for the two or three minutes to switch drivers\nOr the new driver would get in at the same location the old driver just got out of\nA and and pick up and continue to drive ... is increasing the amount of time the truck was being productive\nIs that the kind of technology you're talking about in laws making sure that there's some regulation over that because my first thought was okay there's an Eighteen wheeler on the road with no driver and it uh uh and and how do I know that the why fires connected to it and that kind of thing\nWell I think that's why a lot of citizens want a lot of our went some level of regulation over at the autonomous vehicles we've I think over twenty nine states and I either some form of legislation or an executive order\nSome degree of permission to start testing autonomous vehicles or something like that tuning in some cases where a single driver may be ... driving several trucks where they're all kind of linked by that that's why system ah al so it why they think that that's\nDefinitely an area that we're seeing a lot of state accident on the area where we're seeing a lot of element and we're seeing this approach of really allowing there to be some testing they need it so great and the benefits are so potentially high Ninety four percent\nOf automobile at automobile accidents are caused by human error\nSo if you allow this new system ... ... potentially reduce that\nYou're going to see a huge drink out ... and the number of accidents and a huge increase in the number of life saved by this technology\nJennifer huddle ... is research fellow with the

will talk about ... or or we need a new economy for the new century or sometimes as political\nRhetoric but talk about things a municipal you can do to be in a again an overused word been an incubator for that kind of technology or that you see in some places like Silicon Valley\nOkay well I think it's important to note that as I've said states and cities have an important role to play and Technology Policy and we've seen because they can be more nimble and have less bureaucratic red tape at times that they can actually promote the innovation faster\nThan a ... state or federal government can now you always have bad examples for example San Francisco tried to establish than the digital regulations on a ... on top of California is already existing regulations regarding autonomous vehicles\nAt the same time you had Pittsburgh\nEstablishing away for a time if it goes to be tested in that city prior to\nPennsylvania passing it framework for autonomous vehicles so cities can certainly go either way by\nEither providing more restrictions or less restrictions\nI think an important thing to keep in mind is that it's not necessarily about setting up you know and an incubator center or and entrepreneurship zone it's about basic things in a lot of ways like examining the bureaucratic red tape that may be necessary to\nOpen a business in your city new examining our their existing things in the way that are deemed vetoed operates\nThat's going to prevent people from operating autonomous vehicles do we need to come out and clarify that no autonomous vehicles are welcome to be tested in our city um and for other things like ... or or\nVarious other online transactions looking at things like occupational licensure of in there's something in our existing licensing laws that would prevent someone from being able to do this here\nIs there also a ... you know so much of this is fragmented in ...\nI'm not just entrepreneurial but even corporations that

little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business the point is not the business the point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil\n... these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what did you write in Nevada as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know sense\nYou know one thing we tell me more when they're getting ready to have a kid go off to college just because you're you shop\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good not Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTile is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle why or to go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to visit with you and thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and and and be a real fat a consumer of higher education\nThings for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real savvy consumer of higher education\nYeah because you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes we are we have the lowest resident tuition or any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all the rights of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enter spirit we're talking about a curiosity independence boldness\nAt pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people ... by the spirit of the underdog\nYou know it's not\nA cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right\nThat is that correct your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so and so that's good I play on words but you you guys got you got to the table first where this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nIt's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nAnd sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nI've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice transfer the immersed in Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residents to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north or south\nWe can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand twelve thousand a little over twelve thousand four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nYou know that's a good school it's not too big and not too small that's a that's a that's just right those are ... deal just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on whether ...\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and ah we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't even more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school so I had all the forty\nReally bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll

what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example with with low levels of magnesium\nYour heart won't beat who very important factor in life yeah I Would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body needs to actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that

that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's their link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiencies\nThere a link there yeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nRest or whatever right and that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting goal in life you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest it wow\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nThe calcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make

is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm you know a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the sciences or little trips a little leaks

Bebe dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worth\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\nSo four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will sell it for a report a lot to the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the dead and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the

obviously the one thing that you take into tonight is the way last week ended how much are or what was the reaction this week was there still is a defense with it a little bit of an edge walking around after the way that went into\nThe I mean I think they know they have to play a hell of a lot that it's a night and uh you know they I think they have to probably get they're not on the fact that they're still in first place and I live here and foreign to and that they've won they've had to fourth quarter comeback center road so uh what have you played well\nSo you know I think it's been a fire more mental a game than anything plus uh you know the fact that a famed up defensively that they're not going to have this last quarter in fact was that they're not going to have one of the best kind of line backers and the vigil so uh you know they're a spotlight it's going to be on\nBeing around the team Newsweek due to appeal to around the first place team\nCapsule ooh it I mean they could hit before you know adult and green of what a lot of games I Know they get a lot of each without winning a playoff game but uh you know they've been at the playoffs or they went to the playoffs the first five years there and we so they know what it smells like a knows what it feels like him\nAnd I think they feel like this office\nAlthough they get beat it and I think this was another uh it was you know that would have been a third straight fourth quarter comeback\nSo offensively they believe like a no matter what the scores they feel like they can ah they can they can win even though that was the last ... against us but it was a tough one but I think it just to reinforce the fact that uh you know this off and can they can do some pretty good thanks\nDog would ship hops in the Bengals dot com bingo steak non the Kansas City\nAt the uh you know his audience can they can do some pretty good thanks\nDog would ship hops in the Bengals dot com bangles take non the Kansas City chiefs tonight in Sunday Night Football I said this throughout the season it there seems to be a different feel about this team than in years past is it more mature is it something else what do you find if anything that's different about this team\nWell it's younger I mean you get guys who are not you know ... by the playoffs thing you know you got guys that are ah\nYou get guys that are ah you got guys that have\nBeen a new ... the new blood Sam Harvard checking face\nThe guys who have picked the best shares a draft shown mixing\nJohn Ross you know a guy who were picked at the top of last year's draft William Jackson who's you know a ... one of the best coverage corners around he comes from the sixteen draft all those guys weren't there when Jeremy Hill form of a ball in the Fifteen wild card and I think that means that you know I think it's got a little bit of a different feel\nOne of the guys who stepped up pretty good for the Bengals ... so far this year has been titled Boyd we know aging green is going to make the big planes and don't look for him in the biggest spots but boy there's been a nice alternative on the outside for Cincinnati so far this year\nThat boys get more catches ... get a you know he's got more yards and a\nGuy like um Kaine and Allen you know he's covered it was all these are the he's taken the next step to being a you know a a hell of a player in this week he's played well enough they're starting to double team so are they need something from John Ross tonight or\nThey don't have pile effort that's that's huge and Boyd leaving boy he's been terrific ah he looks at the yard boxer and they converted first found\nSo uh uh\nBut they got to get a they got to get more out of that crew a boy has given them what they lost with Jones\nMargaret Jones that any something from John Ross to give them what they kind of loss was so new a she's a different planet and ... you know\nThey're hoping he can give them some of the elements that time we killed gifts for the chiefs you know I can score from anywhere in the field he just got to get more consistent catching a ball he's obviously nowhere near retail who's a ... maybe the most dynamic for in a league that they think Ross given that same type of the item is it that that same type a\nDynamic action and they said they hope to see tonight\nI mean obviously that's why they they use that he's picking the draft on um a guy who was a a tremendous burner and Washington you know his speed is off the charts but he hasn't been able to stay healthy you see just one of those guys that that that's always going to be an issue for\nProbably hope not they hope these over it or they hope he's over it now I mean ironically he when he scored the thirty nine yeah especially when it gets some Landry getting hurt that's the players get hurt on so you know they're hoping that he'll over you know that ah he's not going to be one of those guys are generally on in his career you know that uh you really can't put a label on 'em yet\nBut uh you know he's got a\nYou know he's got a shot to come back and I and uh take it from there but I mean the thing about John is not only you know he he makes the effects of the council you know he has that kind of steam so even if he doesn't have\nYou know six catches lady yards they still have to they still have to account for him you know ... green scored ha green scored four of us by touch now this year in the swat with John Ross next somebody outside is the fact that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Charlottesville", "day":
