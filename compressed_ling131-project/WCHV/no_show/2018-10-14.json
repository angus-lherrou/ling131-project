appreciate it it was fantastic representation of connections\nAwfully proud of our players you know we didn't play particularly great but you know you're playing a team that's that's that's got an extra week to prepare and we knew they were going to be ready and we challenge the heck of our guys to be\nA well to out or above their level of\nOf preparation and toughness and um and I thought we did that today we didn't particularly execute in some areas you know where he gave up too many yards on part returns were gave up\nQuite a few yards on defense but quite well in red zone and we didn't do much often simply um except for when it was really really really important so I'm happy that our kids persevere through the ups and downs of the game and and\nExcept for when it was really really really important so\nI'm happy that our kids persevered through the ups and downs of the game and and ultimately found a way to get it done couldn't start this game any better defense comes out the first place you get the formal and you take it down the field you you get the score and then the office really just kind of bogged down after that they had an unfortunate interception on the second series\nAnd then the second quarter just seemed like it was a struggle all fences with\nThat really was you know we you know we we get a little thing go on there and and bounce one off damons chest and it gets intercepted and then we had several things that really were routine that we did not execute it was really disappointing quite honestly I'm\nA you know they're just with what they were given us we had several\n... you know really easy routine things that we did not hit and it was\nYou know it was bad and it was hard to overcome that and um but our kids continue to battle continue to keep plugging away and ultimately found a way to get it done but my goodness it was\nIt was pretty tough sledding and for the defense obviously didn't have a lot of video on Cape ... made a difference series kind of had hot hand there in the first half a little bit yeah I Hope he's okay I didn't never hear what what happened to him it was a pretty decent look he took a down there and the red zone but um yeah we we played really well in the red zone\nI'm you know we gave up some some big plays but we found a way to get them to keep them out of the end zone for the most part which ended up being the difference in the game you know I mean the fact that we were in it because we played so well and held him to feel go attempts this is why we had a chance [noise] what about halftime\nYou guys are down at the half and then obviously come out in the third quarter you get the ball first it's a quick three and out\nKind of walk me through what was going on half time any panic or any you know I felt\nReally good I mean we made a couple adjustments scheme erratically to go try and take advantage of what they were doing and we come out in the very first play and miss a lay up\nOn first down I mean not even close to the kid and um\nYou know get behind the change but I felt good because we hadn't done much and we were only down whatever the score as soon as you point so I think that house so I felt lucky and I really felt good that we were going to get get some things going\nAnd you got Quincy Patterson in there for years and he met a couple of places at once you're there at least you got to move to stick with him\nI felt good you know we've been talking about that for a long time and you know now that Hynden as the backup you know we talked about you know putting a little package in their frequency and using them a little bit more see how that goes one way or the other we're kind of are thinking about doing it a little more on short yard itch but\nIt was so hard for us running the football we weren't in much shortage stuff so [noise] ah we just got a little drive going there and just plug them in for a couple of plays he did a good job I just walk through that last part there when the gas you get the big stick at the goal line by Rodgers and Quil and he looked like he had a Sunday hop couldn't\nCorral at very good and then he falls down at the two yard line but then look what happens after that Haiti's lay drive it was just phenomenal converting third downs before they'll walk me through Ryan and what he was able to do there\nWell it's kind of the tale of Ryan you know like a there is some really good things in that drive and it's not so good things in that drive but um you know we found a way to get get it in the end zone but we certainly you know we're on a there there are about to punch it in\nYeah uh we called a similar player in the game and I'm Out and work out what the plan but we came back to it and uh you know we have to just write and\nWorked out well is that one of those things that you're just watching that ball you're so open it's like well that thing ever get to me\nYeah yeah he was in slow motion I just I I really a walk in and out to concentrate on it um you know sometimes it was the hardest ones\nGo out and then you get to a to point conversion man what a just an incredible and what is the game like this do do you guys mentally for your psyche 'cause you 'cause there was a struggle and the second quarter to move the ball all through this game really\nYeah uh we knew they're going to come out jacked up and ready to play 'em\nBut we you know we're ready to go we had some mistakes here and there which made a stall out but um\nYou know we kept that and can play and um and did what we had to do and then to the game and got got the wind which what can you say about ... what he was able to do tonight actually on that last drive yeah I'm so proud of ... I don't have the words to say it I mean he he played his ass off all night\nSo I I Can't say enough good things about you know he kept\nDidn't didn't get nervous and\nYou know stay calm and that was contagious hurricane now about that for than Romney had yeah that was that was big time I'm a proud of him and he was he was running are too you know running hard and physical or all night\nHim some style points with the defense\nPoor than Romney had yeah that was that was big Tom I'm proud of him and he was he was running hard to\nYou know running hard and physical or all night gives him some

to turn over the first series you can take it down there the score on a fast and then man off and just kind of running and saying what was going on there what was their deepest doing the mess you guys\nOn it really wasn't what they was doing it was just that we wasn't execute him like\nHe wasn't going out there really\nPlan outside wall and it really hurt us for a while we was in a drought so\nI really think that when we really calm down\nEverybody got digital file and we really focus and then it was it was all good\nGuys are down to point to the half did you make me the adjustments

Virginia Tech just two minutes into the game the final numbers provide while as runs for eighty eight yard touchdown froze for two Twenty one two touchdowns\nTwo interceptions as well but most importantly Virginia Tech ghost Ninety eight yards on Eighteen plays to win that game twenty two to Nineteen Ryan is down and walk around with like\nAll right Andrew thanks very much rank congratulations man this is exciting I Know you're ... big time\nThank you uh\nYou know one side or it didn't look for the whole game but we got out there but when a God turn the page we've got to buy a week this upcoming week we've got a lot to improve on we've got to hit the film a heartless next week get better and practice and turned\n... this game couldn't start it any better deepens comes out on the first play they get to turn over you how easy it was a touchdown run for you I mean nobody ever touched you\nMay or how to make a little smoke a blitz gotten this then after that just a lot of wide open air uh took it in easiest such on my life and\nI can imagine so I walked me through a what happened in the second quarter you guys like running than just couldn't get anything going out to get nine yards and second what was happening what were they doing defense the your guest could next ... very well\nIt's kinda like coach went to set after Old Dominion he said you know I was hoping we would pull it out and then I could teach the lessons after when because it's clear if there were a lot of things that the whole ... weren't happy with for about\nFifteen minutes of this game fifty six minutes or so of this game tonight they're all sense of execution inability to get the running game going really didn't seem to have the connection there with Willis and some of his outside receivers\nNamely Damon ... they'll send but now you get back to work you have the by and you can hopefully correct some of those things because\nYou know North Carolina now just the one went on the season and they played very well tonight but foster said they played as well as he's seen them play\nThe season but at the same time like they're going to come away from this game thinking that they had more than a couple of opportunities to win this game obviously to put it away on the play that Terry Rogers forces the fumble from Michael Carter but also you can remember hokey is let Anthony Ratliff Williams do and it was essentially alone in the end zone and Nathan Eliot\nMissed him on there you know and there's just a couple of other examples in this game as well so for the ... I think they feel very fortunate and obviously very grateful to win this football game tonight and that's the most important thing is but foster so eloquently put\nBy the same time they're going to get back to Blacksburg and I think just influence it has the ammunition that he needs to say guys we learned we should a lotta toughness a lot of character and it was clean these things up\nAnd get after the second half the season and so ah so great to see guys like ... voice\nCome along and play really really well and Eric ... obviously had a big night catching the ball because Dame and they just couldn't seem to get together on there for whatever reason the double covers the ... the high low or coverage on him but to see those other guys come up with a certainly encouraging\nYes it was particularly ... avoid the physicality with which he ran off basically a couple of screen passes see through\nThat their farm is absolutely sure it is man into the end zone Greg Ross and then did it again\nLater on on another big first down reception and yeah give portrays for in a a lot of credit I think he frustrated ... cents a night and and really had him locked down and once the hokey started to look elsewhere and Ryan will it started to find a comfort level Eric whom I thought made the offensive play\nOf this game safe for the touchdown of course in the scramble from Ryan will is on fourth down but that thirty three yard reception he had Mike where the hope is we're facing third and seven they were really like you say running and sand the beginning portion of the second half\nAnd all the way through the second quarter and that got this team going and then then the often looked pretty good from that point forward but you feel really good for ... just a couple of days after the one year anniversary of course the tragic death\nOf his older brother and a smile on his face coming out of the locker room and making a positive contribution in multiple ways this football team tonight so many guys how she gains as well as the big ... hours a week removed from losing his mother who\nAre just so many smiles so much exuberance coming out of the locker room and for a long time and I it looked like it was gonna be the opposite mood on the buses back the Blacksburg so this one I guess that raises the hair on your arms and and a lot to feel good about and a lot to work on going forward and how about the defense just\nAfter time hold on to field goal attempts instead of just kind of the men don't break and then they miss a couple of field goals and then you get\nAnd a lot to work on going forward and how about the defense just time after time hold on to field goal attempts instead of just kind of been don't break and then they miss a couple of field goals and then you get the big turnover in defense just never quit they gave up some yours is big place but never gave up and uh the huge play the game was just monster\nNo I thought coach once I said it best with Andrew Greta at halftime when he came out and he said you know not executing an offense and are red zone defense is saving our bacon is the phrase that he used that was absolutely right and you know countless times and the first half and then to the second half\nCertainly looked like North Carolina was going to be able to extend into the lead and the first place in the first half but then extend to uh to possession lead in the defense just never let them get there and that allowed the whole key is to stay in this game and ultimately steal it which they did\nAt the end and bud foster when he just to explain to you there Mike or he said I don't care about the stats I don't care what they say he will eventually it'll get back and look at the film\nBut at the end of the day is got to be awfully proud of his guys because they just kept fighting\nParticularly after giving up those big places I think a lot of average defenses an average character players would wilt off those big place and just kind of allow a walk in touch down or an easy score of some variety and the next player too and it's ... never did that that's that's a lot to be proud of by that you\nWere so Quincy Patterson come in there and gave him a little lift their head and one series gets the first day on those all I Know he got a lot of ... regulations on the sidelines or\nYeah absolutely it was interesting to hear coach went to talk about that and the rationale behind that it did provide this team of spark but he said that was actually something that was preordained they had that package in frequency this week and the rationale was endings are backup if something were to happen to Ryan well as we don't want to have gotten ... hertz\nComing in on a running series so let's throw Quincy and you do have the four games with which you can place so that did work out he did he did certainly didn't look out a place\nFor the handful of snaps that he was in their picked up a big first down for this team and that was the drive again following that Kumar reception that really ignited the scene towards an eventual victory so that was exciting for him and I'm sure it was exciting for the fame get fan base to to glimpse a little of the president along with a more than likely your future at some point yeah\nHow about Oscar Oscar braver had seven months forty three yards had the kind of go away and kick a couple of rugby styled loosen was doing such a good job returning must first yards they had all year and a foot return\nYeah I liked the adaptability from this special teams I I've always liked the way that James cheapest is willing to take what the situation is and usually ask of bread was able to get enough hang time where there are two opportunities for returns but\nTonight for whatever reason not quite as much and dad's new some is a very elusive lay make her on the back end the guy that the whole piece of course coveted to join his brother Dionne\nIn Blacksburg but eventually chose the player in North Carolina you can see why he was so highly sought after but yeah that adjustment for Moscow to step out rugby style those plans don't look pretty but as you say they ultimately toppled enroll rather than fly for an average of forty three\nAnd it's pretty darn good they were able to eliminate new some ability to make plays in that third phase and again that was another reason why they're able to keep North Carolina at bay and ultimately prevailed on\nYou know it's pretty amazing I mean they put the Cape ... played really really well and it's hard to tell you know there was no video on him to see really really could do so do you adjust to him and the way he played in the LA comes in and plays well\nThis is just phenomenal when with a great fan base that would focus have they were here and you just wonder how much this will help them moving forward having for the final five games at home the psyche there seem to be able to pull through in the night that they didn't play great football and get the win\nThat's the big thing you know that's a good teams do is they win without their a game and the hokey you certainly would not claimed they had their game offensively a lot of that credit goes to North Carolina and the way that the defensive coordinator proposes was able to skim them up getting really Carney back\nThey claim they had their a game of offensively a lot of that credit goes to North Carolina and the way that the defensive coordinator proposes was able to skim them up getting ... Carney back it was a tremendous boom you could argue that room to the defense of line and unfortunately he came up a little bit ...\nTowards the end of the game but yeah I might think about this uh the sixth game for the hokey now foreign to\nAnd then three of those games at some point they've faced somewhat of a surprise a quarterback of course Old Dominion with liquid Russo learn on the morning of the game two weeks ago that Daniel Jones was going to come back off his classical injury and bud fosters unit shutdown that blue devils team and then for it and tonight wasn't a complete shock or to kind of leaked out that he was going to play\nI thought the hokey is you know again the gave up some big plays in the run game but ultimately stuffing in the red zone and then I'm fortunate to see what happened was for it and because I Do think that he's the future that position at least in the short term\nHere in Chapel Hill and and you just hope for the kid that it wasn't a significant injury because at first glance it certainly looks\nLike it was well it'll be interesting to see if um food got arrested for he got on the bus for stealing one on the road [laughter]\nHopefully got on there are males may be trying to take blood falls drought\nYeah our Salter sultan ... yeah that's going to go viral a donut on social media by a number of people that's ... that's fun to see in those raw emotion moments the relationship\nBetween those two guys because of course but foster has the relationship has with coach beamer and to see that you know just important as the head coach of this football team but blood foster still almost seems like kind of a big brother one day and a coach one day you know always in those moments that seems like blood fosters the first guy that he seeks out\nOn the sideline and it's just a cool dynamic you know this is one of those nights where we gather here might just outside the locker room or in many cases in the locker room and it's just\nIt's fun to be on the fringes of this program a new experience when they're just absolutely in those pure moments of joy and then we saw that following this when you're right they stole the skin is no doubt about it\nAnd that's the thing I mean you just see these guys Andrew just ah you know it is man they spend so much time working in the ... been so many hours working to be able to have a big win like this on the road pretty cool they've had announced getting little quiet down the hallway and we're going to send it back up to you upstairs to come and get it wrapped up but what a win for those guys tonight\nThere's no doubt about it it was a grind it out when it was it ain't just went for for the new tech but ultimately a necessary ... correct to stay right at the top of the ACC coastal and a half your eyes set on that ACC coastal division championship but necessary when for Virginia Tech tonight\nTwenty two tonight teen over North Carolina of ... ... as mentioned ...\nAnd the ACC and tonight by the way the third way and under coach ... take when traveling after three quarters of the first one came November nineteenth two thousand sixteen at Notre Dame trail thirty one Twenty one one that gave thirty four to thirty one the next one came the belt bowl\nDecember twenty two thousand sixteen against Arkansas trail twenty four Twenty one going into the fourth quarter one that gave thirty five to twenty four and of course tonight Virginia Tech trails\nSixteen to fourteen going into the fourth quarter wins the game twenty two tonight teen on adult in Keene one yard touchdown reception ...

buying your products has met their needs I found that most people I Know when it comes because things are becoming so rarified folks will pay almost anything for good fresh\nProduce they don't like it they think it should be cheaper but they realize there's a growing gap between the value of the food that he is not organic not locally grown not natural and the stuff\nThat they can find in the

here in my area\nOther people are buying a biased but is it this time of year what there isn't any more of potatoes were gamble locally here in my area potatoes have been wild really people love the

after my year of living great fully as I like to call it so I had a wonderful career working in these large corporations I learned a lot about process and compliance and working across diverse teams

understanding Katie that ice core creates a life map out what is that\nIt's a set of recommendations in other words\nWe will go in and assess the situation\nWe will take their medical history will look at the medicines there on we'll get the names of their physicians we look around the environment we open refrigerator doors and look at expiration dates of food we take a lap around the car and note things and scratches and then we look at it again next time we ...\nWe were asked to stand in as if it is Sherry we're taking a high level\nFinancial or ... look or their picture where do they bank what other institution so far so I'm\nBasically what we're trying to do is establish where they're at in terms of wellbeing and where we think they can get to the life map as a planet closes the distance between those two points\nSo it can be matters like look we think they're master bedroom needs to be downstairs or we should retrofit a tub or remove it and have a zero entry shower put\nIn a way we think they should um higher home care or we will often function a little like a quarterback we have all these special teams a lot of the work we do ourselves but often we will work with\nOthers it's that interdisciplinary team this notion that more heads is better than one I Am not a financial advisor I Will not and cannot give my clients financial investment advice but I can pull somebody onto their team so to speak who can\nWe work with banks and attorneys and financial planners we work with the assisted living communities we work with physicians' offices or last week one of my nurses was was talking to both a pharmacist and a primary care physician on the half of one of our clients\nTo put her on a deep prescription program right she's taking I think over twenty prescription pills there is a ...\nThere is a question as to whether or not all that Polly pharmacy is doing more harm than it is good off and uh I I think less is more as we age and social work with the doctors to reconcile those meds and and start to wind some of it down\nI mean those are the types of activities we get involved with on a regular basis and and again part of what we do is we're this fulcrum on which a lot of other points rest um the U.S health care system we all we all know it for being inefficient and imperfect\nIt is highly sigh load by professional in malady in some ways I think that's right ah it means that you're going to get a very focused look at whatever's wrong with you on the other hand most of us are seen you're nodding most of us are seeing three four five physicians\nRarely do they talk or cross transfer and moved transom to one another so we any good care manager can become a fulcrum a hub uh connecting all those folks and and\nWe fly at thirty thousand feet but then we also dive down and and you know come down to a foot off the ground and and try to move\nUp and down through that atmosphere of wellbeing I'm to draw a picture and that life map is often a series of observations and then recommendations I'm with timelines near term goals long term goals look this the stroke victim wants to get\nTo the point where he can transfer out of the car that's the long term goal okay well let's let's start working that ... and that's what the map does it's a plan\nAnd ... and the life management advocacy plan is something different\nOne in the same one and say oh yeah we we refer to it as an el map or a life plan but it is really that that plan to get from point a to point B\nDo you are at a core ah it sounds like you've already answered to this and in every answer but to begin a little more if you will of the services that you work with as well\nYeah yeah um we work a lot with a state attorneys are off in a state attorneys will\nRefer clients to us so for example at what we often call an elder orphaned\nSomeone never married no kids is sitting down to prepare their state plan and pretty looks at them and says okay great we need to designate an agent on your power of attorney who's going to be well they don't have anyone it doesn't mean they're socially isolated they could have a healthy social circle and friends and neighbors\nBut somebody to stand in is a finished Sherry's problematic so the state attorneys will route them our way\nBut it's also reciprocal we will sometimes meet a client in their seventies and realize they have no state plan that's of concern and so we will send them um to several attorneys and say look you want to get this done\nWe work with financial planners at times who\nWill observe clients over a long period of time and you know they come in for that annual review of the portfolio and suddenly the financial advisors really realizing that that person has slipped some and they'll contact us I had a trust officer\nTell me one time that he'd had a a high wealthy client for long long time\nAnd they had formed a very close working relationship so much so that she was calling him when her cable went out ah when the cat\nTo go to the vet and here he was suddenly conducting all these concierge services but he certainly wasn't insured to conduct and I I doubt you know the financial end\nIn Baltimore, Maryland Dr influence or Ken obviously be deadly yet many people don't bother getting the vaccine how bad was the fatality rate last year\nUnfortunately we had a very severe and widespread influenza season last year the season was quite bad enough variety of ways we had a record number of out patient is that then is it to the emergency department for flu like symptoms\nThere was a record number of hospitalization for flu like illness\nAnd also a record number of deaths the CDC or Centers for Disease Control and prevention estimate that there were over eighty thousand death that were in some way attributable to influenza that could be from the infection itself or sometimes patients die with other causes such as a heart attack\nOr a respiratory problem or a stroke that was around the time of having Lou and Lou may have contributed to that patient staff\nBut you don't necessarily have to get a shot now is that right there is another option\nYou're right there are different formulations that the influenza vaccine and one of those type is available as an intern nasal\nVaccination that doesn't require an injection that as an option certainly for people who have intact immune system they don't have any kind of immuno suppression\nAlong with the standard flu shots I understand there are what are called high dose shots for people over sixty five which federal about\nRight well as we age the immune system doesn't respond and quite as aggressive manner to vaccinations and so\nThe high dose vaccination for older individuals is really in an attempt to give that bigger amount of anti and get the immune response that we'd like sea\nSo there is a high dose vaccine sometimes that has a little bit more side effects meaning local irritation at the site of the infection but individuals should inquire about getting the high dose vaccine if they're concerned about really boosting the immune response to flu\nWe're talking with Dr ... senior director of infection prevention is the Johns Hopkins health system in Baltimore, Maryland doctor is this right now we're we're speaking it's October ... very best time to get a flu shot or is there a time when it's really too late to get it\nChris this is the perfect time to become vaccinated against influenza but goal is to become vaccinated before flu starts to circulate it takes about two weeks for your immune system to respond to the vaccine and so that's why October is such a great time\nGet your vaccine before we start seeing flu virus circulate which usually starts sometime in November and then peaks in January or February\n... current CDC guidance as to complete vaccination by the end of October but to the second part of your question there really isn't a time that would be too late so if for some reason someone doesn't get a vaccine and realizes even into the January February march timeframe\nI Would say go ahead and get that vaccine to protect yourself\nWhat do you say to someone who says I got the vaccine last year but I still got the flu\nWe hear that kind of complaints commonly that despite getting a flu vaccine is still got the flu there's a couple of reasons for that is the first reason might be that during respiratory virus is on lots\nOf different viruses are circulating and so many of us catch one or another of these types of viruses which may or may not be the ...\nSo the flu is generally a much more severe illness than the typical head cold or virus that you might get so that might be one reason that someone thought that they got sick\nEven though they got the flu vaccine the other reason is that\nThe flu vaccine is not perfect we are still doing a lot of research and development trying to come up with a better flu vaccine we know that last year for instance it was about forty percent effective as it is possible to get the flu vaccine and they'll get this is the but the good news says it's still does protect you\nAnd so overall even if you do get the flu you have a shorter illness and less chance of severe complications west\nWinter's flu season was as you mentioned earlier really bad does that for ... a milder season this year or two we really predict\nIt's difficult to protect to how severe any given flu season that's going to be but one of the best tool if we have to look to the southern hemisphere

I mean just you know we're all sinners\nAnd yet he for whatever reason he asked me to do this and and and I feel like God is prepared me for it and I'm I'm I'm incredibly blessed and so uh no it's it's really been no looking back and and no hesitation\nYou know every now and again just like anybody I like a little glimmer of a little glimpse of like always got really real you know and that kinda thing a question that sort of thing but I have to do is go\nBack to these moments these these ah different moments when Christ when God just made himself so clear to me that those sorts of doubts that\nThat's like a normal day might he might have a they just they just disappear in and said\nNo no no that's a blessing\nI'm asking a question about when I read the Bible sometimes and like last week on the program we were in a first Peter\nChapter five and I was telling the list is you know I read that chapter many many times now and all of a sudden I get to I think it was the first ten\nOr ... and I and I get to this earth that I've read many times but all of a sudden that particular burst jumped off the page at me and I'm\nIn I spent really two weeks kinda marinating with this verse it it it it talks about it my paraphrase of it basically uh the apostle Peter is saying that after ... and he's he's I'm trying to encourage\n'em others that are going through suffering and he says after you've suffered a little while a guy himself through Christ himself will complete chew\nAnd Christ himself will strengthen you and Ken from you and and and it\nIt was really um a moment reading that passage where\nI was able to kind of connect the part about you know you have the suffering peace but then you have this incredible um encounter with Christ that brings this a strengthening and completeness and confirmation I'm\n... and ... but my point where I'm going with this father Nick is that as I'm reading this on thinking about Peter who himself seemed to [laughter]\nHe had a lot of challenges in his life you know I mean our yeah he was no you know perfect or you know would would Jesus was was picking his team to follow him and to build his church\nYou look at Peter and the mistakes that he made and so where I'm going this is the longest question I've ever asked for [laughter] but but we're on room with ... does reading in the Bible about real people who\nMade mistakes and yet a Christ ... and God through Jesus strengthens them ... and this does that give you a um\n[noise] I don't know a little extra boost of courage that my goodness I mean look at look at what Peter went through but look at what God did with him\nOh my gosh you know I'm a one year five inch for so many things about it mentioned Peter yeah\nJust the the the typical you know fall and cheering being denied Christ street signs and yet he was chosen to be the first of these leaders of the church and\nYou know and it's one of the things that I was saying that people say I think it's really true it's so clear that our church is that Ryan Lee\nLead because it because if it wasn't it would've destroyed it fell two thousand years ago you know I mean it might have lasted a little bit of water last\nAs ... as long as it has and I really think it's true I mean the the more takes him perfect people like you and me ... and ... and Peter and he does amazing things without you know an edge it's so clear that it's beyond our own tower edge\nAs she um in our in our natural state we couldn't do that at that crisis asking us to do it on to death and Peter is right up there you know I'm just\nAh he died in Rome a skill preaching the news and and the way all of us are called to do that we couldn't do that on our own ... you know price is with us completing the Holy Spirit God is\nIs allowing us to do superhuman things with these mere mortal human bodies that we have and that it's it's it's really I mean it's it's a miracle\nI have another story about Peter that I think about frequently if if you do ... um\nIt's that um de Jesus is with his disciples and sensory uh and and he asked I'm kind of open question and says or who to people\nSay that I Am and then you know some say oh you're John the Baptist or other people say you're a larger and then uh then he looks at 'em and again it says okay but who do you say that I said I have a\nIt's the chapter that read it it marriages and weddings um it's first Corinthians chapter Thirteen and I'll warn you know when I heard your description their father Nick I never really\nKind of put the two together but really what you're describing is that divine loved the poll puts tend to were lovers patient love is kind of does impose it keeps no record of wrong when I read that prevent the fifty a time that that this\nDivine love keeps no record of wrongs like all the time you've been wrong by their neck sorry you've probably never been around I I just I I still have a little bit of my list slump in may but this divine love talks about\nThat that I mean when when the Holy Spirit comes in and resides in you that you're now have this divine love about you and and you got to get rid of the list\nYeah yeah well you know the thing is that divide law like again if it's if it's just a purely human law that humans can we can log and are you on law is a is good it's it comes from God\nUm but it's not a perfect kind of love that only can ... that is only got love and so we we will and ourselves what we mean\nWhat we need to do is ask God for it and then he didn't give it ...\nAnd so he will still a sweat that the ... on our own we won't be able to forgive our worst enemies on her own rate we're going to last\nBut with God\nGiving us that the law with a ... gift it's really a gift when we see that gift we are able to somehow let go and we're able to somehow forgive and and it doesn't happen on our own we have to ask God for that divine\nGifted he will give it to us and and then we of course have to accept it you know something that's got gas that we didn't know that those habits but uh\nBut yeah we we have to ask and then he gets ... or ... that of course are you hearing scripts radio if he does it if he doesn't quite get that keep on knocking it all keep asking and he wrote gift he always gets just not because of square or because he loves us because we're a perception and you know we keep father and have for it some\n... ... it's good stuff about the ... I'm also reminded you know the muscle poll has ... ... amazing books in chapters in the New Testament and in the book of cautions he talks about Christ in us\nThe hope of glory\nAnd um then in the book of ... he says ah you know I can do all things through Christ to strengthen so um I I'm just I'm I'm sort of trying to make this connection between\nUh you know Jesus God the Holy Spirit come reciting living inside of us and and what happens as a result is this massive transformation\nYeah yeah you know and and you know of course I you know I'm Catholic and and pass as a Catholic we believe that Jesus truly comes in to us body stole body blood swollen divinity into our body\nThrough the Eucharist and it's not just the spiritual reality it is a physical reality is not what Christ comes into office and then little by little we become more like pricing we become Christ becomes\n... stature and us because we're a sheet him because he received his body blood\nAnd and that he said this is my body this is my last this is my applauded we we received that and that truly transforms us we we can't do it on our own like I said before\nHe does the transformation in August and then we become more who you were meant to be because he is\nHe is growing and plus we must decrease so that he may increase in us\nAnd yeah it's a it's powerful and that's it's all God's power is more powerful than we can imagine\nWe'll father Nick we're wrapping up the show today is always so awesome to have you on the program and you need to know the last time you were on I just want to mention this uh last time you you were on the program\nYou talked about the Haitian love of the father and I just want you to know that that has had a incredible impact on me because I've been I'm really just kind of pondering that and enjoying that and embracing that so I Want to thank you for that\nIf a that you've given to me in and tell the listeners\nTricia that yeah I mean you know the lord he speaks through you so often and\nHe's he speaks through ...\nSo many people and and and\nI again it's not because I'm so great I'm not far from it because I've I've just said OK you stink Florida\nAnd uh you know and I'll do it I Can't but yeah it's it's it's really a great honor to be able to just be a little ... all of this\nWell father ... you've been a blessing to me so it's my turn to bless you made the lord bless you and keep you may his they shine upon you and bring you peace thanks for being on the show for the next\n... plus you and your family thank you thank you\n\nPlace the word opioid we've gone and you might feel differently about the bill and one of those seven five and twelve sixteen ...\nView of the ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to ... insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get on my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated and Zander will be there as your guide every step of the way\nVisit ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take an important step to get your family protected\nThat's Zander dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty to\nWith your CBS Nineteen whether it's already outlook on forecaster Tommy Stafford on Sunday some early morning sunshine was increasing clown throughout the day ... and the lower sixty Sunday night mostly cloudy an isolated shower losing your fifty\nMonday mostly Colombia few afternoon showers lower and middle seventies mostly cloudy on Tuesday is scattered shower and lower sixties Wednesday mostly sunny pies in the mid sixties\nFrom Blue Ridge life dot com I'm forecaster Tommy Stafford force even want to seven five and twelve sixteen do you see these trees\nHappening in central Virginia sponsored by Virginia bless their everything\nEvery year pets and shows them left the kids at UVA children's hospital for the annual charity dog lost at the annual medical center of Charlottesville part of the benefits of ... a children's hospital the woman's called the green will be hosting its third annual helping hands craft bazaar on Saturday\nNovember third from nine AM to three at Rutgers Valle elementary school come shot collection of handmade item from some of the areas most talented craft or is [noise]\nTo Charlottesville women and minorities business ... will be on November aid from ten AM to one key and I think every school city center Carver rec center register at W.

Competitive Enterprise Institute author of red hot lies power grabs politically incorrect guide to global warming and liberal war on transparency coming up\nIn a little while but kicking off is Hector Garcia\nWho is a huge uber which is a phrase I learned a few years ago had nothing to do with you to dietary choices would have had to do with where you create your information and it is a platform that I think many\nInformed that I think many many people try to use but they have now turned their position into a weapon against conservative thoughts Hector welcome to freedom and prosperity radio how are you sir\nHow you doing how are you a very good\nSo if people can find your website directly at Hector Garcia dot com but tell us your story about a Facebook and YouTube and these folks um targeting conservative saw it and what was it they got you targeted for this behavior\nYeah sure I meant to clarify a nothing around the\nThe product of what I create in terms of content it's political actually my my stuff is more I could make an educational or for that matter\nBut um I have a Facebook group or wherever a bunch of accounting that's kind of just help each other out with a county related issues ... a sort of they're very private were sort of just helping each other out on\nOn technical aspects of our practice and I also have a YouTube channel with my same name would I create a video to ... how to do things and quick books out of the things related to tax returns mostly educational mhm\nAnd and so you don't talk about then what what brings you to the program regarding a you know the the targeting and the way so it doesn't sound like there was anything that going on there that would you bring YouTube or or Facebook or anyone or to bear on you know what you were doing\nYeah so um interesting thing is a ... and you know I I Know that your show is really mostly about you know hey if if if the government that war\nWith the public well there are certain ... like a\nLike you too and I'm ... and I would say it isn't it isn't that sort of like I think I Would take both positions that let me tell you what happened to me and then a lot you to draw your own conclusion okay um I have my YouTube channel that have over five hundred videos for the most part it's original content just me sitting in front of a webcam and telling people how to do things\nEvery seldom the I Would say point one percent of my videos I Will take somebody else's content and I would comment on it it's actually a very popular John Ryan that used to world where you come into somebody else's country\nRight I mean the game runs do this a lot to gamers so there's\nAggregators like Google and YouTube specialists are are trying to have their cake and eat it too they want the influence hers are but they want to be able to shut them off even though they never really started them and the first place\nWell um I Would say that there are some cases have that let me tell you some some things that are where nobody\nUm ones you can get over a certain number of followers the certain number of views\nI used to allows you to apply to monetize okay and my decision ghost goes both ways right YouTube monetize is because they can place I think the videos and by the way even if your channel is not monetize\nThey're going to play I mean if you have an on monetize channel they take a hundred percent of the revenue now why did you have a certain clout I have certain a number of followers certain number of view they invite you to be part of their partner program and then what happens if they share that they show the revenue with you\nNow according to what I Know it it's about a fifty fifty split but if it's if it's just what we really don't know what that is but I had been monetize of Utah and I do get monthly checks or from YouTube so I'm not gonna\nI'm not going to say that you took takes at all for themselves I don't know if\nIf they if they split is fair or it is and I probably don't want to get into into that but they do share that with the creators but then it it is true they actually can shut down your mind at the station at any point in time they do have to over arching policies okay they have the copyright policy\nAnd they have when they're called the community guidelines and a couple of policy is going to be ... mostly are tied to to just legal ramifications of of infringing on\nCopyright then that sort of thing says I'll just say you you too has to be very careful about that\nYeah specially with all these video gamers and folks like that playing somebody else's video game I guess you got a fair use and things like that\nExactly the fair use this as it is the exact time and then the other side of the community guidelines and that's a tricky one community guidelines is the one that they are that they use in order for them to to figure it out or what the community quote unquote wants to watch it with the community wants to bear or what the community wants to tolerate\nAnd in the ... guidelines they are sort of strict\nRules around hate speech and you know and and harassment and all sorts of things now any one use of any watcher\nCan fly your video as harassment or hate speech or something like that\nAnd and the way I the the way I understand that like I don't want to claim to be a year to read them experts but when you ask people in a specific period of time flag a specific video to be\nOff that the computer system automatically shuts down to China and this is a in order to let's say minimize the impact or the ...\nOr the exposure that YouTube or Google themselves would have\nIt on to find a message that would not less than eight ways when we'd be theme politically correct or whatever happens to be so it is likely that a competitor of mine or maybe just\nSomeone didn't that didn't that didn't have anything better to do orchestrated you know having a whole bunch of my videos the flag this harassment hate speech whatever happens to be sexual\nContent that sort of thing is not not not or you can have it in your ... and and the aggregate that made the channel shut down the ... fortunately I don't think they have enough\nPeople in their team to be able to respond to these things quickly enough or to respond to the creators with just the refunding and logical answer behind why it happened so that's the challenge that I have you know like I've I've kind of have a love\nHate relationship Google you know I I I Love them because they helped me amplify message right I hate them because\nAt any point in time I don't know if my message it's in the right place to be amplified because they could be shut down for any arbitrary reason\nWell and that's where I think that a lot of folks you ... them all the reasons possible\nAre you feeling that there is um a cake eating it too thing and this comes from you know these events who consumer electronics show is that where they're basing these decisions on algorithms rather than editorial boards or a ... as you said you couldn't call somebody and say hey why was my\nChannel locked out because it was done by a trigger a pre programmed algorithmic trigger that you can plead with that but also it it covers them legally from you know having to say oh so and so close my website down and and therefore I'm bringing you know some sort of action\nAgainst them as well um and and I think that's where they're all these sites Facebook\nTwitter Instagram YouTube are all you know finding themselves is\nA ... it would it be better and should they have some sort of editorial board even three or four people than oversea on a daily basis hey what channels got shut down today\nA look at why hey that was wrong or hey all these flags came from one area or one bunch of people or whatever it may be in to follow up to find out hey why did the CPAs had skin yoga YouTube channel at\nA flag this harassment how can a CPA be harassing people that kind of thing\nUm because there doesn't seem to be that human factor into do you think that would help them actor\nYeah I mean that that could be that that you present an interesting notion that there's a book called humans are under raid by a Jeff called in and in the book he kind of a paint a picture of what computer while we won computers to do and we we don't want computers to do\nA show for example you know there are certain\nTypes of surgeries that the human hands just can't do and we have to rely on computers to do it but I mean it's sort of human assisted computer stimulant so that you know I as a society I think we're always going to\nTry to leverage computing power in order to do things faster and better and these are these ... posted they're supposed to aid the human they're they're just another tool to\nBe working faster instead of having a aboard and look at every one of my video to figure out if this is in fact arrests meant or not because they just have way too much content to deal with right there's one piece of that book that I thought it was really interesting where they talk about\nYou know think about fifty years from now ass society we we started getting all this jobs to robots and machines you know what what type of\nJobs that you don't ever want a robot half right so maybe a a a priest\nAnd maybe a a a priest or something like that it ... you know some some of that consoles someone consoles this all the way one this to be coming from a computer system and and and most people would say no absolutely not I needs to be a human being\nBut then what where the ... like where is that that fine line what about a judge you know do you want a panel\nOf judges to beat a bunch of computers I like the data and I'll put you know ... what would make the most sense based on all the ... all of the testimony\nAnd good God this stuff when we see this is ... you know everyone\nWants the umpires eliminated from baseball and we'll go to a computer to tell you what balls and strikes are and that kind of thing but yeah but what what you brought up something you said something Hector\nA little while back and we were visiting with Hector Garcia's Hector Garcia's dot com he's a CPA found themselves on the wrong end of you to YouTube's algorithm\nYou mentioned something just quickly but it's I think one of the frightening things is that some some how all these videos of years got flagged it seems\nAs harassment or hate speech or something\nI ended up very easily could be a competitor who who either for the time being or just a Ford you know the giggles of it even um you could do this to a competitor\nA and shut down their YouTube channel in a way that they make a lot of you know their business rather than competing with you directly or they're going to use subterfuge like this\nThat that is possible fortunately I I don't think I Would ever know and I don't think that you took that interest to tell me yeah so so it at ... I\nSee I always hear that is right right that's that's going to start a war\nWell but it also engenders the idea of whom we can do that but that's what that's what I think this algorithm based decision making lead you to is if somebody can figure out a way to trick it uh then then you can do use that ... being weaponized it again you use that phrase against either\nA political opponent of business competitor or just somebody you don't like\nUh in general um you there for many reasons some some of them might even be good reasons but um again free speech is a very difficult thing to codify\nUm what what have you learned that can help of a listener who either keeps a YouTube channel or ... or something that uses social media to to move its message factor\nYeah so the first thing I Would tell you don't put all your eggs and won by ... you cannot rely on a third party to be your one back of your one place\nOr where your information is I mean this is I think for most people is it obvious and I shouldn't be saying it but for someone like me that that is a techie person and I thought it was sophisticated\nIt's ... you know it it was something that I didn't even cross my mind it didn't cross my mind that either YouTube or Google can be shut down on their own way didn't cross my mind that they could shut down my ... ... settlers that that would be the very first thing is you have to have\n... ... they're they're ... I I also learned that is different you're paying back up and be done to the right\nSo a lot of nice to have a copy somewhere I can dig it up and reconstruct\nThe ... ... is what I was most afraid of is how long it's going to take me for me to ... to have the same precedents I had when you took years to kind of tired of oh channel\nAnd that was that was I Would say the single most important and that's something that I learned I probably would have been very expensive lesson secondary is\nIssued about ten days ago well in this case right after President Trump announced he would withdraw from the Paris climate treaty in another couple of years he has not withdrawing a and it was a tree\nSeveral governors announced that they had created an organization and they would continue to us role and so on and it always I I you have to wonder how does this work ... and as the report lays out it\nA Potemkin organization that doesn't exist it's somehow pays people but it's only a website and websites can pay people I suppose\nThe only one that ... page very very lucrative go ... or ...\nExactly right it's a ... page or politicians so here's what they did\nThey created an organization that doesn't exist and you'll see you wonder why this means my like there was correspondents in the report Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York president Cuomo under a FBI investigation now for staffing up his executive suite by poaching from New York agencies ...\nWell he apparently has\nPrivately funded staff at his disposal as well his special counsel and Alexander Cochrane suggested to the staff of governor Jerry Brown California ... ... and Jay Inslee head of the Democratic Governors Association got Washington that their lawyers were concerned about\nCreating a pretending to have this group maybe that should actually\nMaybe they should actually incorporate in order to keep their correspondence from those\nPrying eyes of the public well fortunately he was not listen to and this report is one result so\nI don't want to find a way to come\nSo what they did it it begins with a may fifth through ninth twenty Seventeen and in which government staff of those three states senior governor's staff okay we've got ones who made national news a few years ago when he was run out of the organ governor's office for a while green jobs ... [laughter] yeah\nHe's he's now with Dan ... with the Jerry Brown and he's sensing very helpful PowerPoints that are also in the report and budget documents I'm calling for fifty million dollars a year in off books staff and consultants for governor is only\nFifty my Mitt only like and the reason was well the foundations are spending over one billion dollars per year on climate he said after he he wrote before you gasp [laughter] my ask for fifty million dollars a year under oh man yeah oh then\nThey said Governor Brown staff said wrote it can't always be a staff performing the work of staff\nNow I I Believe it's supposed to be about my check averaging it certainly is at you [laughter] but ah most and most of the idea was born [laughter]\nYes it was I'm really busy and then they said in the threat or wrote there's a plethora of ... interest in the governor's ramping up their climate advocacy\nAnd the bells well enduring therefore\nLet's you know they've got a lot of money to spend less we should our taste is reasonably fifty million year I'm really busy I'd rather be less busy so they set up these they had a beauty contest for nonprofit groups to interview\nTo service to cut out and it's all laid out there and all of its glory and draft agreements and so on beautiful beautiful wonderful draft memorandum of understanding in which they say the U.S climate\nIs an independent project of blank\n[laughter] you can do to be determined later or so we ended up as God [laughter] I Love the the the horses even been invented yet but we got the card that's great [laughter] so it really is\nIt's it's disturbing because if you have any interest in governmental ... whatsoever to see this happening at law enforcement Amir six million dollars where the monopoly Matt confined to special prosecutors to pursue his issues of interest\nAnd then a budget that we don't know how much they got she but as you'll see in the power point they budgeted fifty million dollars in off the books staff for governors just on this issue\n... for twenty twenty\nThirty million for next year\nTwenty five million of which goes to quote pass throughs and they list them\nThey ... they actually oh my [laughter] yeah they call them pass through and they get to serve\nThe governors and guess who they are one of his time style a group called advanced energy economy won his world resources Institute which the wall Street Journal kindly noted in an editorial climbing about accountability we exposed as providing inhouse staffing governor into his office\nAt least ... also discussed at length and paper and the American lung association among others so they are laid out\nThere as the pastor's for all of this large s and a mere Fifteen million dollars for this year ten million to be passed through these other groups to support your local climate activists covenant there's something is going to be in the news it should\nWant to be in the news it she begins today I suppose a because temperate twelve\nIn the evening news or the fourteen Governor Brown is hosting a global climate action summit well at the beginning of the report you'll see the price you the concept note circulated to donors yes this official state function is in fact a ten million dollar\nDonor donor financed production oh God and they said that you will have a chance to a rub elbows with the policymakers and ... ... which is which is to guide activity going forward so you're selling access you are using public office in\nSupport of going on interest and there is something that it's a little close to home here because well Jeannie joined\nUm Virginia joined in Virginia joined it ah ah yeah and and they get it on Gmail just you know\nI'll go carts so do we say we're going to run again the G must stand for government right to Missouri Dr north of Chris entertainment\nCall us at the tail end Virginia it's part of this and more to come on that because governors of California and New York [noise]\nHave a plan for Virginia [noise]\nAnd then you lost their coal mines and their hog farms more to come on that [noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean nothing nothing Michael Bloomberg ever goes regarding Virginia is bad for you [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI I Know the answer because you and I've spoken to many times listeners dialing around\nYou're talking about stunning amounts of money being passed\nHot this organization they're really that much money for these companies these Tom star groups in these Michael Bloomberg groups to make this kind of venture capital\nVenture capital is worth it [noise]\nWell it's it's energy and it's the lie flooded economy and if you can make that which works on economic can force people on to what the state has to mandate and subsidize and so on whoever this is very big business remember my introduction to this was I was working for Enron and on day two\nI learned that they had two of their business plan essentially round the global warming agenda and us say global warming industry was born you know the the Enron\nNiagara mohawk power I can recall who was in the room back into time I couldn't believe it with the green group says we sat around plotting how to get a global warming treaty before there was\nMore global warming treaty and thus began my three week career at Enron but uh there's enormous amounts of money here the agencies are looking at eight several hundred billion dollar settlement to four companies just to buy their way out of these\nLawsuits that are designed to settle not win saying you've caused climate change why she you know it's going to cost you to try this just pay me off of the way that seems to be what's going on here this is a spectacular amount of money at stake\nAt sixteen hundred

where I had um a traumatic brain injury is where I didn't have insurance but it kind of cleared out like everything that has saved up and\nNow we're back on track living with my mom and I found you on line and this is the first time I have worked very fucked over five hundred saved up the IRA\nAnd I'm just looking for what's the what's the next step and just like for that support\nOkay wow so how you doing medically\nLuckily medically were as it is just you know play it in and day by day upon neurologist a solid we get 'em Medicaid down\nAnd just try to work slash stay healthy and save save a little bit of money but until I found you are a lot I didn't know how the discipline belly save\nOkay so you're you're right but you were able to go back to work then good yes and that's got to be a big relief how old are you a play wow what caused the brain injury\nUh fortunately of salt but not really focusing on that just\nSure either jewelry is the man you've been through hell okay so you you you're you were down out it cleaned out everything did you follow bankruptcy\nYeah um my discharges actually fix week\nShe filed chapter seven yeah\nWhere are you cleared off all the debt okay did anything survive the chapter seven like student loans or a Irish dad or anything like that\nBut fortunately I didn't I'm getting to the student loan trap but for a lot of my friends going into it so I tried to fight a war of always been a worker so\nSo no alone and is there any at all after the bankruptcy\nNo suffered okay All right cool so what are you making now\nUh when I say I'm Thirteen at the job that I work ... hour but I also coach um we'll call so I'm a job is twenty five an hour the fifty the last I'd be proud of the lessons or or anything like that\nA man oh man oh man you are back good for you maybe you can coax lacrosse back from a brain injury you've come all the way back congratulations thank you lord I got a guy who shoot it I put it on the other so how do you start over\nWere you start over a\nWiser\nAnd a less naive about financial things\nSo whatever kind of debt that you know you know ended up in the bankruptcy its reminder to avoid that right\nAnd we know that an outside variable a horrible tragedy\nUh caused your financial trouble but had you had a pile of cash and absolutely no doubt at all you probably could have survived that so that's our new goal is to become wealthy without any bad and so as life uh lives opportunities and problems come along\nYou're in better shape to tackle either and so how can we quickly most quickly rebuild your financial life now that you're rebuilding your overall life\nAnd uh that's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that get on a written plan a budget\nA void that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a\nYou know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now but a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life a show\nThat's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for emergencies investing being generous avoiding debt I'm you know living on a written plan a budget jump on every dollar and get that out it's free and start working that and um have you been through financial peace university yet\nThough no sir everything's just been through you know watching watching you personally\nOkay cool well I Want you to go through the class it's nine weeks long it's one night a week for nine weeks and I will pay for it I Want to be part of your recovery okay\nThank you I appreciate it and really\nThe only thing I asked as if I give it to you I Want two things one is I Want you to promise to go to every clash and number two someday when you're rich and famous I Want you to give it to some guy who had a tragedy\nUh definitely will ... you know but I Want to be here for about ... you know yeah you're going back you know the kids so\nYeah absolutely you get the poor and the kids so that they don't get into 'em\nMess is like you've been through hopefully so I'm not that it was your fault but I don't mean that but um my goodness gracious man you're you're cool I'm Glad I'm proud for you you're doing good stuff [noise] hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you into financial peace university Michelle is in Watertown South Dakota Hi Michelle how are you\nAre and we'll get tape thank you for taking my call certainly how can I help um\nWell I just started to get programs in August and I have currently pay down three thousand dollar that um that that actually that's the guy I was making painted on a monthly payments on how\nOur fate and now I Need to start on like that that will collect shed which came out I think ... dollars mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like I had a father king hundred dollar bill that there there are are\nMade her take signing hired for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousands of dollars that works for getting mhm\nThat I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays\nA cashier what's your household income [noise] um\n[noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand\nForty five thousand a year okay let's let's say you're out\nAnd ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend\nIf you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal\nBut you're going to have yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand\nFor that is forgiven that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you if they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they

four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their\nEarly twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but [noise]\nHad a lot of wealth in the background and um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about [noise]\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery as for me in my house we sort of a more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a

we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of\nStress in your kill max formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example with with low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat who very important factor in life\nI Would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with no what happens is that you need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is ...\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the comics formula ... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually take into account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic type pen\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you name seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss\nWhat happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spin the Nick we make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more arrests or whatever\nRight and that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually\nSo they started to manifest wow\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nThe calcium and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a test of this powder and mix it in\nYeah and you drink is cut down the great ...\nIs really incredible because it it actually goes right into your blood stream\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special

that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing right there\nRight to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect where a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't really realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and magnesium is excellent for back

well here's the thing that she waits which\nYour ears and getting I think I Would want to decide\nWhere idle Leo's based on some formula other than where the babysitter live\nThank you for joining us Americans over the last year open phones a AAA eight to five uh five two to five Diane is on Facebook what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it\nWell a line of credit is an approved\nAlone\nThat you take out only when you would want to\nKnow where you could get pre approved and have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe tried to get the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one which get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of that because when you don't have any payments you know what\nYou have money the bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit\nAnd bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb one buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles would affect it in other words\nA hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nThe more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes like one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built that say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean ... again Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing the thing about that\nIt's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought one of the raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or no I got to got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at that your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know I Can't because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey they take them off Sherman what's up\nI'm standing on the high court emir I've got about three thousand dollars and then the cat out donating should I invest in China then\nYou're going to college\nHere I mean the college with an a plus for entertainment and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service that type of a charity and I keep program at the community colleges is either you know our first yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nCrime so that's what you want to do you won't be a programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus yeah um\nCan invest it ah here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you Dustin as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really going to cause your income to go be a lot a lot\nKnow getting that level of education is really going to cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not\nPut it in a retirement account to stage a with this amount of money in your situation\nBecause again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study\nWhether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to\nPay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our growth take home pay into our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we're already contribute we don't have much left over from August coloration\nSo when we say ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate and so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that a a ... choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or\nOkay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect guy I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're bent on those guys [laughter] huh yea no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's a for then that means we need to put in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know as a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nThat that's that's what I Would back off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us this is that I ...\nThat that's what that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\nYour joining us today Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things\nThat may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life your seat changing these habits is the foundation of our teaching at the smart conferences and\nWe did that whenever we yeah\nYeah for each one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty thousand dollars and not\nMuch we don't do that and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board it can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nWhat are the main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much\nWell let's Drew Drew have soil I also think\nThat um they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it his way but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\nOkay go what was your why\nRight here I I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I listen to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy and what we're leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching at\nModeling it in teaching it yeah I can change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves\nAnd it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what you if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders along lawyer or some people that kind of went yeah I think you'd be more nuts\nYou know we have ah we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have someone who tried to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors that were local that were definitely coaching his on keeping us going not only through our you know scenario but also helping us lead a few so desperately mhm\nBut not so when he came home the first time and said uh we just bought this car it's killing me and listen to this podcast I Want to do something different where you resist under judicial like will finally you woke up\nI Know I had a pet in my stomach when we\nBought the car law and\nSo and like and traditionally I knew that was not the right choice but we kind of felt that pull that we needed to do it\nOr he played your pod cast on a date night at the typically remember that date night [laughter]\nThat is so on romance [laughter]\nFor him

Joni the rams looking strong again today in Denver\nAnd let's check in with Bruce born\nAll right we've got three oh to to go on the third and the rams are in command a twenty to three minutes ago they expanded their laid on top of girly second touchdown of the day a low stress one\nYard roll into the ends or just to go along with his chain yard run in the second quarter on the day now sixteen carries one hundred thirty three yards for Todd girlie who appears to be getting along with cold weather\nJust fine as today's game as being played with temperatures\nIn the twenties meantime things got better for the rams moments ago they just got to pick out a tipped ball from John Johnson the third and they have the ball on their six we should point out there are those not an rams uniforms who are still wearing a smile hair\nThose would be the bronco cheerleaders\nBut then you know Bruce what has happened to those defense or is it just the past Russian nothing else now because there's now two weeks in a row in which the run defense has been shredded\nThe run defense has been shredded and um of course last Sunday in the ... uh the past offense was destroyed attempt Arnold connected for two or three ...\nA very long range place you know a place of fifty sixty Seventy yard something like that\nSomething like three of them against the bronco secondary what used to go by the name no fly zone as a matter of fact when a affair appearing before reporters the last week a quarterback Chris Harris was where he has no fly zone T shirt but maybe somebody should bleach out they know on the no fly zone\nThis uh last week a cornered by Chris Harris was where he has no fly zone T shirt but maybe somebody should bleach out they know on the no fly zone a T shirt it's really it's just everything on the line backers\nUh uh the the rookie Bradley ... today they've got a couple of facts today those were the first two of the year von Miller sex or down um it's it's across the board with this and this defense it's just it's not what it was\nOkay Bruce born then you know dirty everybody loved the job on the draft night well I'm ... I did I liked him allied didn't necessarily think that he was a must take for Denver when he when he was going to be in the top ten but he went right about where he was supposed to engage off to a little bit of a slow start\nBut the one always affects the other to run defenses always affected by the past events and vice versa\nOr I don't letting a team to leave walk was a mistake by the Broncos during this off season I understood\nA contract was getting pricey than some other\nConsiderations they had to deal with um he is a guy who from time to time to go off the reservation a little bit but he can flat out covering flat out play so I thought that was a chance they're secondary was going to take a step backwards they would just banking on the past Russia being so good\nThat the corners weren't going back to cover long wound up past rice hasn't been as good as a string and just noted a middle section down and ... and come in and rewritten the record book for sex by a rookie or so those corners of being left out there on an island a little bit too often\nAnd getting burned a lot so uh if you have you do that and then you try and keep you safe these back in deep and ready to help now of a sudden you're getting gas ...\nJaguars or on the board cowboys trying to answer a little more than midway through the third quarter here's Bob Stevens in Arlington\nMidway through the third or the cowboys lead a Jacksonville out twenty four to seven it was twenty four nothing at half time but the jobs out on the board here in the third ... thirty four yard pass the ... chapter nine play eighty two yard drive\nAnd on the other side of Prescott is that a big day with his arm and his legs fourteen for Twenty one a hundred and fifty nine yards and two touchdowns both to colby's late Seventeen yards and nine yards basically has caused seven for eighty seven yards\nAnd it didn't date for Prescott a wanting the ball he's just carry the ball ten times in this game for eighty one yard he's got more yard is on the ground ... F wash for fifty two yards on fourteen carries\nBut I'm a I'm six minutes to go here and the third quarter the cowboys on the move there after the Jacksonville forty two yard line trying to answer that touched down in Jacksonville just scored leading the jags twenty four to seven\nNo bomb and in Tennessee it has been a quiet day for the titans while the a of a Raymond's have scored again sorry when playing for a second there burn Douglas can help me out rent how are ya\nI Will try my darned us to help you out here um the rate and often has just control this game from the outset on the first half there was a Seventeen play nine minute drive and they set an offensive play Dr then open the second half the ravens go twelve place Seventy eight yards\nSeven minutes and twenty seconds before it kept off Alex Kotlowitz looked left\nAnd solve basically about five hundred acres to the right he rented it untouched for two yard touchdown and the titans are just not been able to get anything going on often\nUnder well under a hundred yards of office and that in fact now for markets Mario it up on in the second half and the crowd was about I'd say probably about two thirds full when the game began\nThat and in fact now for markets Mario it up on and the second half and the crowd was about I'd say probably about two thirds full when the game began and there's plenty of Lucy showing up here already in Nashville or the ravens have the ball back distance item midfield in one of those days the kiss cam there was proposal\nAnd the ring was dropped so it's been one of those days all kinds of all over the place to be here in Tennessee and it hadn't been raining for the last thirty minutes that doubles everywhere at right now it's all the ravens Twenty one nothing five away in the third of the guy gets bring back\nOh yes absolutely and I hope you didn't drop it into a puddle out the way the rain has been coming down there so a a tough day all around in Tennessee but uh the ravens have made it look easy today\nYou mentioned we were talking about the uh defensive issues and a like\nA specifically for the Denver Broncos sure enough no sooner do we say I was I saying that they're deep friendship secondary I think was having ill effects on their ... because they were getting burned against the past as much as they did they come up with a big interception wasn't a great play and came right off the good rental shoulder pads\nGot fed 'em right eat away and write well you don't want to and I'm writing a shoulder pads popped up in the air and the rams were able to come up I was going to be the Broncos we haven't come up with a pack so they got the ball deep in ah the rams territory so maybe they can make this one context just yet\nAnd jailing Ramsey who took some some heat from you just a ... a little while ago ... and potentially very big play with Dallas now up twenty four seven and seemingly ready to answer a all turnovers are going to be reviewed and that apparently I thought it was an interception but I guess a ruled incomplete sorry\nHere come the cowboys right back to answer and we will get to that one in a second but right now the Broncos have answered the rams was re checking with Bruce Martin\nRichards at twelve thirty one left in the fourth and the rams laid twenty to ten on a blustery day in which quarterback\nJared golf is not at his best running back ... Gurley a stepped up with a ... yard TD run\nAnd a one yard run for a touch on the ... Gurley Nineteen cherries one hundred fifty seven yards\nDenver reduce the deficit to ten late in the third quarter when case ... yards door wide open Emanuel Sanders she caught the ball the one and and swarmed his way into the ... on this after the intersection of a ... passed by dairy and Stewart however\nThe rams are responding Goff converted a thirty seven when he ran Thirteen yards down to the twenty six yard line\nOf Denver and what action resumes the rams will be putting the ball into play from the twenty six yard line of the Broncos twelve thirty one to go up in the fourth quarter\nRams trying to stay on beaten they lead the Broncos twenty to ten\n... led to Nashville where it's been a quiet day for the titans that does not seem as if it's getting any better here's Brent Douglas\nWith if the minutes left to go the titans had a very um I\nManaged they first down on a Twenty one yard run by Marcus Mario to and then they did have the first pass complete ... Davis who was the hero from a couple of weeks ago\nSo the titans finally did get about one hundred yards and total often for the day but then they had to put it away and now Joe Flaco has the ball and in um history has given any indication in this game he's going to lead the ravens on potentially another long drive here if they start out the fourth quarter\nBig statistic in this game\nIs that Marquez Mario to a career high\nEight that than twenty three now on the season for the ravens which leads the NFL on the other thing that goes for the titans loser should the jaguars Lucian got a three way tie with the two of those and the Texans\nAtop the AFC South so that race is very much tightening up but anytime titans do still have a chance here at fourteen fifty three left to go but the ravens dominating Twenty one\nBy thank you very much Brent Douglas now let's said to Dallas and the cowboys and the final seconds in the third quarter pulling away and here's Bob\nOver at the end of the third quarter now and the cowboys Lee Jacksonville thirty to shop and it was twenty four nothing at half time\nBut the jags that cut the lead down to twenty four seven on a blight Bartels thirty four yard touchdown pass the DVD Westbrook was kept in eighty two yard drive the cowboys have responded with a pair of threatened by her field goals here in the third of fifty yard or and then at thirty two yard or the\nLatest was set up by a thirty five yard interception return by saying ... down in Jacksonville eight yard line at came awfully up asked by Blake borders on at the flush and bought her now three for three and feel goals today now is ... fourteen consecutive fuel rules for the cowboys after missing his first one\nUh that cross got a big day to day sixteen for twenty\nFourteen consecutive ... for the cowboys after missing is first one on that cross got a big day to day sixteen for twenty five a hundred and Seventy seven yards and a couple of touchdown passes to cold be free of nine and Seventeen Beasley is caught aid for Ninety five yards here on the game\nAnd he's also washed a press guys also wash for eighty one yard on ten carries it as far so again it's a thirty seven Dallas at the end up three quarters and the cowboys knocking on the door at the Jacksonville Fifteen yard line and they just recovered Jacksonville bumble\nFine thank you very much Bob and a reminder CBS Sports radio stole free line at eight five five to one to four to seven broad you might guy go great news there is a quick way you could save money switch to a guy cocoa tobacco dot com and Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance the Sunday night one is a good one tonight between the chiefs\nAnd the patriots and joining us right now is she's writer for the Associated Press they've ... they've ever jak majority McDonald how are you\nI'm great how are you guys are doing just great this has been a brilliant start did you ever think that this could be the the start imagined when they made the move to Patrick homes that are would go so swimmingly so parts of the first five weeks\nNow I don't think anybody really saw this coming I don't think an anti we saw this coming a I mean not not just the fact that he's played so well but uh you know the entire team as a as off till five and I'll start against a a really tough schedule I think a lot of people looked at the schedule and said if they could make it through the first six games at three in a they'd be in good shape and uh\nAnd I got a chance to the six to know that they can take care of business and I\nWas there any resistance from any of the off into teammate job Alex Smith during the off season when the ... made the decision\nTo move Smith and hand the job to Patrick Rome's certainly the results are in but I'm turning back the clock a little bit to six months ago were there any that had their doubts that we're willing to verbalize those questions about trading a veteran quarterbacks and turning his team over to youngster\nYeah I mean I I think there are some guys that had some questions about it uh I Know Travis Kelsey is is the one guy can think of that actually\nYou know went on the record and said hey what are we doing trading Alex Smith I mean you're talking about a guy who had the best you know his career last year he was in the pro ball he uh [noise] let the chiefs to the playoffs back to back to visit titles so\nAre you are trading away a guy who's proven himself and and turn it over to a guy who started one game so um yeah I mean there was a there was a few guys that probably had some questions but you're talking about a bunch of guys that\nSolid Patrick ... do you know last season in pre season in the weeks a game and he got his start in an office every day in practice\nA you know I think they also saw that the army strengthen the maturity and the intelligence were all there for him to to be a success right out of the gate and uh and ultimately it was a decision that I think a Spanish David and\nYou know you mentioned in just a moment ago as we talk with the spread of the Associated Press who covers the chiefs are all the intangibles that Holmes has so they make this move and pretty much from that\nSecond on it was only a matter of time before Patrick bones became their franchise quarterback what was it about him the most that that really ... they said this is the guy we have to have\nA I think it was in a kind of what I read it to the intelligence or you know I talked to Andy Reid and the and the pre season one on one just for a little bit and and he told me a story about how the heck Patrick homes in the last last spring before the draft and\nAnd they were they were in in a lot of quarterbacks and and basically throwing everything at them or in a in a classroom setting and then having you know the the guys are thinking about it\nAnd they were they were in in a lot of quarterbacks and and basically throwing everything at them or in a in a classroom setting and then having you know the the guys are thinking about drafting go up to a white board and background the entire play and\nAnd Patrick with you on the guy that now that every single play and in an aunt who is often this is pretty complex to be able to do that and and have that quick recall\nRight out of the gate I think ah speaks volumes for how how smart he is um and then the one thing that I think they've learned here over the last year or two is what a an incredible workers or you know he could be out on the town and and trust me he won't have to buy a new drinks anywhere but uh he's he's he's always in the\nPractice facility Andy jokes by having a kick him out to make it go home and on his birthday he was watching film of the forty niners are caught up the next week or instead of going out to celebrate so\nAh he's he's definitely a guy who is all in and uh and I think his teammates see that and appreciate that and that's why they sort of rallied around him when maybe that could have been grumbling about ...\nTo say he's achieving would be a mess of understatement right now for the rivers the only you know to be in the NFC would have better pass rating didn't him to do this quickly and his career is he has pretty damn impressive but I was just checking some stats maybe the most impressive to me is he's fourteen touchdown passes\nTo nine different receivers so it isn't like he's picked out his favorite guy and they weren't as great relates Jim ... zeroes in sharing the ball with all the other guys which is also gotta make 'em pretty popular guy in a locker room\nYeah absolutely he he certainly is going to find the guy that's open and it doesn't matter if I ask you Sherman the fallback caught a touchdown pass in liquid or a Travis Cal the obviously he's got a a really good reporter now is Travis Travis has like three or four straight one hundred yard receive the games\nUm
