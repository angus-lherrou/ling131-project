I came here I did everything legally I'm looking at the policies here I'm like\nI might as well have done even legally [laughter] it might have been faster to do it that way but no we want their policies and now that I'm here I can I can talk freely I can enjoy the free market system\nThe the the western culture western civilization that really build something here and if you bring the ideas of socialism if you know the math on its social does not work\nThey point to the Scandinavian countries but the whole that's working because we subsidize their military we all know that America's military wants is what's keeping that afloat and we will do their taxes or strolling guy and I can feel it here in Connecticut\nOh no question there the reasons given him a country where\nIt's a capitalistic parts works in the social part doesn't and then the other reason is they have no military we spent about eight hundred billion dollars a year in the military to protect them and they spend nothing\nAnd that's why they're going to have ramping socialism socialism doesn't work in Venezuela or Cuba it doesn't work in the Scandinavian countries ultimately you run out of the ability to spend other people's money\nIn Milton Friedman one of the great signals of all time about Thirty years ago that you cannot have\nA first world country and open borders next to the grinding third world poverty eventually it'll blend together in old take down the first one of the country America will be taken down millions of Central Americans more poorly educated with no skills that we need come airing collapses social welfare state\nAnd overrun the hospitals in the schools in the prison America cannot long succeed it's the failure of our country\nAnd it's amazing 'cause when I come here and I see the fact that America launched some some some sovereignty\nI I can respect that there is something that goes back you know I come from Niger and the idea of some of them could never work there because it's a crime if they are we have and and the thing is everyone in the socialists or a society believe there's some utopian\nThing you can you can work out no I'm Sorry human nature\n... capital is works on human nature to drive the free market if you look at um the fact that capitalism has brought half\nHas cut global poverty in half and twelve years and sort of it is by the un standards and my twenty thirty\nBecause of capitalism it's it's it's really a ... you can't fire it's really probably the ... and it is up here in Connecticut I'm trying to get I I think education is the key 'cause if if I'm able to tell people hey listen you don't like them but it didn't look at the results I mean\nI live in a ... it's the lowest in history I I'm like how he got it\nYou don't like them but\nIt will get the results I mean\nMean it's the lowest in history I I'm like how he got to look at Bill Clinton was at her high and President Obama's record high welfare recipients and now it's like businesses small businesses up for a hundred percent\nUm I'm I'm just looking at the numbers here and I'm like okay he wasn't called racist until he started running I'm like I'm looking at the joke you I'm looking at what they're offering and they're offering actual filled Beck and I don't know where it's socialism\nAt this idea that just never just never panned out\nAnd strengthen Iran a collie mix them and libertarian huh I write a column where the Trump stir in New York City\nFor twenty Thirty years received every award then Al Sharpton and could give him every award Jesse Jackson could give him he he was a humanitarian he was a civil rights act and all of a sudden he's running for the presidency suddenly the aged Seventy becomes a racist\nI'm like well this is in the middle tier life he was caught everybody likes to Hamad Ali and wrong parts with the um one of the parents\nAround Franklin he he was a good friend he knows where he was a great friend of all the any gave money to Chuck Schumer he gave money to Hillary Clinton suddenly he becomes obese he becomes it's ridiculous\nKnobs absolutely and it's it's good to know that if if we agree to divide and like\nHonestly the Democrats right now\nHave such a stranglehold on the black community for no reason it's it's\nIf we can get over that if if we can because like for example if it was horrible historic event they watch that the struggle with the Japanese and trying to think what the reason\nI think it's because I'm immigrants so it's not exactly something that it was in court treated us who I mean if you go through the public schools I went to a public school ... Hitler but they never talk about a hundred million died under communism so that history just vantage is and and and I think education is the key I definitely do\nWell ... we got to go but I Want you to stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut it's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the\nShot of capitalism in conservatism the worst run states in America are controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call let's continue with more\nI'm going to put a call in or to Corey Lewandowski here in about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight look stimuli call hills breaking loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress and I say oh contrary moons prayer I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd and I think this is the October surprise that will sink the Democratic party come or the next sixteen days let's continue with more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes from Corey Lewandowski top of the next hour we have Kevin Jackson near the blacks fear\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records and that\nCan you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was ...\nIt would be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the uh the country artist\nWould have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just getting about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd they asked her do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no\nIt was appropriate because she was an adult he was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second\nThat was the the converse if Donald Trump\nHad done that with during the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse drawn away and I'm sure the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you\nNo big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nHas always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent of the media coverage of this president negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of\nTwenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent\nI Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top of the most competitive country in the world again for the first time in ten years and there was no credit for what the president's done right around the twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries\nThat he got returned not one plane loads of cash don't palette loads of money\nBut on his own share when we don't forget these people back you know you saw the pastor come back just a week or so ago and that was it was a blip on the radar screen\nThe president's getting twenty Americans either in North Korea and Egypt or wherever that then from that part of their job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's at least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico\nAnd the mainstream media hates\nThis kind of an issue percolating a little over two weeks from from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration from Central America and Mexico into our country there is a I like Google disinformation there's a hundred and fifty million\nMexicans Guatemalans Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million not like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking two hundred and fifty million\nOr central and south Americans would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration and they talk about refugee status they're talking about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers however\nUh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border hundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed because they will become drug meals and that when these individuals'\nPaying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and Mexico into America when this is funding and fueling MS Thirteen tries to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they pass through in Mexico has the drug war and order and somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their bodies and sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raped on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's report it which is not done by the mainstream media that this was an extremely dangerous route that men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles and then when they get New America\nThat they're they're not released many times you go work in a bra sold on us an Austin you go to Baton Rouge and work on a profit or if you're a man you sent you stand on street corners to sell drugs which is paying back your transit feet there there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality\nOf what the Democratic Party is encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski\nOn sixty minutes about the reality of what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for drum of the reality of what happened\nTo the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happened to them and it's still just sick of all the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this one is in the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who are coming to this country the porn impoverished that are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only do they two hundred and fifty million people from South and Central America want to come here people from all over the world want to come here but we're not a country if we can't control our borders Ronald Reagan said it you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world and the greatest privilege we can give somebody is to make them a citizen\nAnd there is a way to do that but\nJust coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important what takes place with these people as they make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border is disgusting\nDisplay of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women\nThey kill them and and you're exactly right\nEven if they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally and those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that that doesn't continue the best way to do that is you build a wall on the southern border\nAnd you say if you make it to the United states you will not make it into our country and there is a process to come here and you will follow the process we're a nation of laws and what we will do\nAs a Republican Party has to make sure that the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nUnlike the Democrats who want to defund\nAnd de legitimize the men and women who serve an ice every day that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski why do the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law\nUntil ten or so United States senators who are Democrats agree to the change would build the wall brings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are you know we have a big law would want the doors in it\nAnd every legitimate person wants to come here to to work whatever ought to be able to do it but the ... the byproduct of that would it be do a lemonade drug\nA heroin and math in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not one controlling southern border\nBecause they love a political issue and they don't want to resolve the issue and look\nThis president went out and say you give me the money for the wall\nAnd all the people that are here through no fault of their own what's arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own I Will give them the president said a pathway to citizenship and that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation\nWhen he made that statement but he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they've wanted for a long time and they said no we're not going to give that to they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border\nIllegally and going to sanctuary cities and centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote they they are bought and sold by the Democratic party\nVigils who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote and they they are bought and sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep\nThat flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they are safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis but you're exactly right you come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there\nIs either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country and that's how it works that that was always work and we just need to know a better job enforcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nIs making a run and twenty twenty\nYou know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady\nShe was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton\nTo become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer in twenty twenty would you do a great job\nOh we love this little challenging thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she would be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's reelection effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Charlottesville",
