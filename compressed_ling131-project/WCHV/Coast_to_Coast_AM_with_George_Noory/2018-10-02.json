welcome back to the program\nI think George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nDo we just started a great bear enterprises that that's what I Want her to a seven stars of the great they're very exciting state of the art very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape or enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master Web designer it with very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what do you run up to lately well that that's what we've had a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things that have been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world abuse says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer right and I went like what what are you keeping me somebody who's mundane for [laughter]\nIt it it's actually uh I I guess in the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology is relative nations of world leaders thing with like eclipse is\nIt could clip says new moons full moons major planetary alignment in other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've been doing that just as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type ...\nNo I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a fine line there there's a fine line there will\nAgain kind of it's the maker causing rather than microcosm so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up\nIt's just kind of where I was I read the the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball\nFootball and so on so I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMarked tell us exactly what is strongly gee is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlantis or when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics\nLived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles\nMercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away\nAnd the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point oh it's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and it kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of moving your in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nThe grade motion so what most people have tuned into over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now in two thousand eighty and if you if someone went to Google or safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's fill George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have ... would you get five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and\nOften you know people want to hear a prediction you're gonna go\nHowever astrology really works best\nIn terms of ... ... as you said and he studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of is like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of the ... and the U.S trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\nHunt several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most astrologers kinda who have been around the horn along time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just the Charlotte I'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out\nTo the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be\nA for instance do well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff a much more focused that's why the Monday and astrology virtual things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic and intuitive\nBut I don't broadcasted particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nScientifically in in sports you rushed illogical psychic like okay stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer and his website great beer enterprises dot com more and more ... to ...\nUm and then October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven to one day crash I'm not anticipating anything like that at least I'm\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that the the people call this planet burn if you're on a\n... you were in its depending on their pronunciation but that plan at the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one when the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically in bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nIn New York Stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in oh five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years and a sign\nThat planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSort of things coming out of left field shocked and surprised as you're on us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other thing is I see on the horizon for America\nAnd for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back uh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six to get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kinds of things like a nation's chart nations are born like people if you can locate the birth of country cities have\nCharts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about Chris zones now cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and\nAnd this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which is the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charging believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ...\nBut basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nSo to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know\nWhat's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now those\nTwo planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air signs and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA serial that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that's\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's cold astro flash it allows me to do some shorter thing so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit\nSo I've got a couple of things on great burnt prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zones so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening with a Brett Kavanaugh and and\nDr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well didn't you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend who said that he was a drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism you\nKnow and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes does on people's too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he\nNot um he could withdraw I mean you know it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything through um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything\nIs really big and what I did is I looked at the chart for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology always look at the heart of a personal or you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nJenna put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus into science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean well\nI think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was alert you think you'll get confirmed it on\nUm I like your logically speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nHe used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation you still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll and I'll say now you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin a\nPennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college and Trump won\nSo amazing work now ... let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nice\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see\nYou see that New Hampshire did it\nIt was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during some I don't know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of health\nAnd you also don't know what he's doing is a trend\nExactly so you got the tricky thing\nWe the other thing is uh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's tar President Trump Detroit is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it so\nShe was kind of an unknown quality in

throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program and that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Hi Donna\nHi I was born in Cleveland, Ohio okay\nPhil Donahue is February second that's my daughter's birthday by the way down the same thing okay every second Nineteen sixty in Cleveland\nOhio anytime or no you have a time Donald ... think tank twelve am while mia Hamm and well there are nine twelve ... twelve ... twelve me\nOkay hold on in the meantime so Brown's go Indians\nOr the browns or they've got one they want to get him for the season [laughter] and and done and do you have a specific question\nI really you know not really an overall okay well\nWe're about to give you the overview there with my computer I this is to take the um George hours what I'm doing now in in minutes the or in\nA union you'd better be minutes on this show right did you measure the taking hours\nOkay or you have a it's interesting just like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means\nLike from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius aquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller had an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three you have five less devising half record more than even where you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... well here's somebody Donna ...\nThat is well here's somebody Donna you're born with Jupiter and Saturn ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world there was something you know we're making a expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover and shake her ... even in your community or a neighborhood or your state you know to do something\nYou feel is significant and and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you know everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an X ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever\nIt is and it's right then you'd say okay\nUh looked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit well for how long you know and then come back\nTo me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces and there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook\nBut but when you have done it for forty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can\nCan subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into see the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of by Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say is I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you\nDid my reading and studying and I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible with well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage charting really yeah ... ... but the thing is it's a very fine tuned I'm there we have ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something call\n... so I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for pilots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different climates but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human to roll card\n[noise] well I've created to to row decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did inner child cards which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of promotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the Gulf War Philips\nThe other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of will doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done\nProject so I've done to row longer than I've done a strategy\nI'm going to give you our next the special callers birth date first of all November\nNineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Radley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois in\nDelano well and we know how about a time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure the ...\nOkay you have a question from mark who just want him to get going here\nI like this all spiritual aspect to you know like our nation also another thing like that which you know make a difference you know are you or anything I well\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make it you know I Am aware of the five different elements and those kinds of things and the you know the twelve ... the birthday is that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know is was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another moon in areas that that is really took\nThat's not so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man\nThat's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon in areas conducting Mars and he's the son science Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently in Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual's ... so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his son science Scorpio need to really get into deep things\nI'm sort of in a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nDo you pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I'm I often enter you know the different lotteries Powerball so on\nA five years ago I had four out of the five numbers of horrible didn't show up wow closest I've come that would've been a\nAlmost two million

anybody's astrological chart\n[laughter] um I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy young at a Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible\nGotten it for a long time and they just had and the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have an order to get\nWhich I think is really unique where people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but\nMeteor you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like there's one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychologically the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final cool series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark\nUnhappy I'm coming birthday to you my friend\nOh well thank you hey another year oh there you\nKnow they keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question would have been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money\nLaundering money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay ah by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic strategy which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and saw it with something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune\nFor Los Angeles and out on the west coast\nWas in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also is the ... sign cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a Pisces ... and ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of the need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and paths okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun sign of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor I'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the ...\nIn ... which is really Leo and Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a of a woman and so the whole ... mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of lower about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a lasting very and in England I mean these are kind of lower but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\n... no just uh how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter\nYou have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nSo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty in Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to forty in the morning or mark\nBoy you're going fast November twentieth Nineteen fifty five what time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty a and let's go to Jane in Florida see what's on her mind Hi Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going out and say hey any question for mark or just reading\n... um or how about general meeting\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty\nEight now okay well uh her mom away [laughter]\nNow we've got the beginning of Aquarius um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well million at the beginning of aquarium yeah\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on\nWhich was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven and tire on is kind of a ... and the mentors so this brings up the idea of getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint we're kind of building\nRainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color your you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nOr creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you with all of a sudden you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life of being a sun science Scorpio and you have a son close to Saturn\nIs you know um you need to be the warrior the turkey note for scorpions warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sun science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and\nKind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving um is very helpful for you over the next a next year next Thirteen months it starts in November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane um how about a year going into my eighth how um yeah I see that\nYeah oh is that going to get a significant\nWell if you don't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own physician\nSo what you want to avoid his nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that planet Iran is has a lot to do with the nervous system so when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects\nOh it's
