A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence of cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news out here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks in jurisdictions\nAnd uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back into tourney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well how research and then he came back and he said well we don't have any listen missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detective\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list that headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well David you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list [laughter] and of\nCourse they would but as it happened\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me\nOh it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because we still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they can hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now\nOf course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it but as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes they say that there's a list exists\nWell or if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exists um\nYou know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and I'm so night we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot you can read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read of reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canines to search and rescue the canine ths can't find a scent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years\nOur dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate and probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to them water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one\nThe number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park well that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but ranting place much more of a role as I explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nThat point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's\nWhen it happens it's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches\nAnd then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this and then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical clustering that I figured out why after I started putting Ken's in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world right um [noise]\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing UK same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean\nYou'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women is a four to one ratio direct my any idea why why so many more men than women may be more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck of the beetles that gets into the break we'll be right back\nAll right I'm not for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro went on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue um how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rule to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there's a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it\nUm and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal ah everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented and missing people it's\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you wanna fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nBut these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this\nI caught territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust Colorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you really can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who getting assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of this scene um who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they really don't want to know the whole story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nIt makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether\nThey don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks\nOr they don't want to give me the information because they have an a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\n\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on it's the people at the top tier in the government\nThat are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it\nI Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when a sheriff's office help on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well\nAnd mistakenly they just sent me everything\nThey just sent me everything\nSo I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and they got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but\nThen it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases ah you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\nSo twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a call ... ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spade a lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean port is Suzanne round\nTrip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scrambled to the top so I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet\nWell\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her up the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually published in the homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time a three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there\nIsn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual dad cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help well eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out\nI mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance with his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and searching day and night well they actually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before not a lot of instances that may turn some results because people are found in areas that have been previously search that's\nBut if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do not Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the chef wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listener not theirs is what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and ... you'll understand this church\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but the national bureaus\nFox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nThe Charlottesville women and minorities business so will be on November eight ten AM to one key and at the Jefferson City center Carver rec center register at W.

some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure\nUntil the family wanted to see some wildlife\nMother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven\nJune nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostels checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paint Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them\nSay that he had arrived all was well checked and things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast to Portland and completed the trail permit\nThe trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in that little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there are ... worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers\n... Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early well they exit the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered him and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff\nAnd deputy came out Rand registration on the rhetoric and the vehicle came back registering to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left all Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nThey called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise]\n[noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and it seemed that some assistance from the national guard keen on since our teams\nSearchers faced rain and wet conditions for many of the days\nBut again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey send it to the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything endeavor dogs were later put into that area I never picked up a cent they ah they had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second city needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there and they are hoping ... said that they are now any communications with the sheriff and yours none never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search almost two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that terrible Turner when she disappeared in her park she at least less left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I see this every conference and I say it on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a personal located can cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there's no monthly service feet and get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nOne of these\n... whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but uh you know a search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um first\nOf all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success\nProbably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen or I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic they've got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever invest the indicates worse like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um there's a remote your roof on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed\nHe contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them I contacted this victims wife I said hey did this person to help you in finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me\nI won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and and other remote viewing cases there\nWas one guy at a conference with a ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far as psychics\nI did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics owners row at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduced myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help you want to help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them\nThe next week when I got back and I never got a response from one of\nWe're talking with ... about his newest book missing for one one land air or water Mardi Palan a\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nWell on September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the ... early they laugh early on that Monday morning Henry ... states that he dropped him off at a location and friendly at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone\nAppears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep in California and left the link the voicemail a strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human found or their animal found or what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes ah some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's only now unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nYou're going to hit the only one\nWe're talking what are

Tuesday\n[noise]\nRight see heart which borders you write in Mountain View in Britain late all areas where in the case was reported scene or cell phones ... county water patrol search they came up in ...\nSo that's a news report from a Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of ... have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come to any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing I I've written about and pass book\nIs that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in the ... it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses and mess\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason now\nBut last tower that they can that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nAnd many other cases I've written about in the past and missing from one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy man that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he was going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canine helicopters ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a\nKayaker was on rush wake one mile south east of the last time they cannot fall on the cell body and the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the termination on the count on a cause a doc was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McCabe in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented and sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men was that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid\nAnd they paid for secondary autopsy several\nTimes when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of G. H. B. in the system of the victim and they were in level so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it they pass out they\nRealize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lot of times that happened in the winter and there was no marched in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a\nA bank of snow you would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf they placed you on the water you would die by drowning not from G. H. B. and C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty sixth drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs and so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases\nBut it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat they're recording it certainly seems like he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody out there that says stop it that's um\nThat's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here and now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies are bound and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things unknown almost like no gigantic bird is sweeping down in matching them up\nUm you know so many ... agrees is\nCalling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this earlier I heard you on this\nThis YouTube say this is I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic because\nNot giving you and your theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\n\nThat they're a pattern say and um this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um uh that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at triangles including one that you're in Nevada right\nAnd his escape from San Clinton at the age of seven eight which led to a string of high stakes confounded authorities and enchanted the public will be very frightening and towns in heads up the modern retailing of Little Women released in may Alcott classic novel which follows the lives of four sisters\nMeg Joe bath and Amy March detailing the passage from childhood\nThe woman has that socks on film on Fox News\nUse for from the bee Jay's network studios believe we have\n\nGood morning I'm Brian down\nWith WC H.

uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had a run up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are gonna want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty\nKurt on the island of mall it's an island in Scotland fifty five years old I Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot we've spit fires and the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force the hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a graph airstrip there\nAnd the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water\nYou arrived at the hotel on December twenty F on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it in Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater\nAnd on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger and she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the torch as soon as you can fly and land so\nShe exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said and it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the lights went\nMake a long story short Gibbs didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six is about four months after it the disappearance\nGives his body is found on an oil\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else\nYou know ... and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it now if gives it jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nCorners stated the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia and I guess that he probably died two hours after takeoff well they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out\nUnanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long has he been dead where was the plane and then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain\nWhen people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die obviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain in a way of saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nBut how would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would fit here doesn't seem to\nWell one of the things is I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of close\nAnd personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees or yeah later that night to get down to fifty but the person left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone in there and a stack in this field is is happened multiple times\nAlso I've had other cases where a parent says might be be couldn't take off their clothes\nSo if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes so the cases I Try to include try I Try to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the book you kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous that where there'll be somebody who's taken by\nSome entities and they come back in their clothes Ron backwards or\nShe was missing or I'm against somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning I'm no there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books\nWe're special notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower and they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\n\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they'd been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not weathered there it's not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where do they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases when when the bodies of water it a certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink ring of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nQuarters that made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days so worthy wherever they been for all this time and that's important to behind finding a body especially of water because\nIt shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it need something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it it's sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body if not the case\nIf they are found there from pretty much intact without a lot of injury to them I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\n... when we first started this trip together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it may be some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about we've come a long ways and I think if you start shutting\nThe door to early you can't see really what may be obvious years later and that's one of the reasons I been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know maybe a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me I mean I think you can where we are today versus where I was six years ago in a huge distance\nAnd uh she fits all the criteria she had you know our peace uh I'm so she got a medical condition anything expert hiker is granted in it's in granite falls granted there in Boulder creek forever if you have to cross through the creek in fact\nUm anyhow um when we went um Mm came back out of the mountain and um we met up with a couple of other researchers and I'm One gentleman had found some future pansies\n'em and they tried calling the nine one one non emergency number and they tell search and rescue and they never called back\nUm and another lady um they were and that generally now became flash at certain points I'm In there and they they tracked big on their own they could give him a\nUm you know I I don't know ... and it was three paintings on her cell phone into an excuse me one of them didn't make any sense it was way off to the left or the or\nWhere you park your car it's not even with a trail is um anyhow I'm I'm just kind of thinking you know I've thought of what this could be and I was thinking maybe Porto to another dimension\nUm big foot big for my the guy who was within his brother had seen big foot a couple of times up in their family and I've seen a shift is twenty five feet above me\nAnd also an underground secret naval base on their own land straight enough I'm On the back side of the mountain that Jim creek 'em at all I can\nAnd I don't know and it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that I might even mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like it but it was like a big fights before\nDo you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff\nWant us there who will get themes reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them but ... you can speak for yourself\nOr all all hit on one of those things are the cell phone hanging I wrote a about a case in Michigan\nSeveral years ago and they track this guy's phone all over this area\nAnd according to the kings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times\nIn this pattern that he was supposedly tracked him and there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased\nIn an area probably where he should have been and

taking my call what's on your mind\nTo questions for David you've talked about how ah people when they have come they haven't remembered anything that happened to them so I wondered if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but\nThere's something about having their memory a race that also you've talked about each German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious ... Germany if perhaps they're more common there\n\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race or you have written about\n... about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids that's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that live they claimed that and is willing to those are a lot a lot of hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taking their very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking mayor or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter wall put in the article or you know that's just the kids imagination the search for set well is it or is it not\nOn the wild card line Carolyn North

uh about a missing people are in the uh Bellingham uh area of the Washington state\nUh the uh over several years at least a recent you know in in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and ah [noise] you know since the during that time period or my ...\nIn a water are in different areas and ah [noise] you know since uh during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a miss a missing son and uh he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh [noise] you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and ah and because he's an adult or we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out as a minister apply to says are being aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers in in over there\nYou know I'm I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you you know if you wanted to try to contact him we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a days I I Know he knows about the defeat story because it was a widely publicized but your son\nUm what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\nOkay or if it happened in Bellingham in it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened uh it and this happened two years ago October uh\nHe uh he\nHad left home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been\nSome friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently had ran out a gash in a can didn't have any money to get gas so he took off walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out\nAnd uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with a with a law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones uh I'm In the cupboard or the area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that period and ah we were just so\nA broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe life uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything at all after that so\nWell under that reason why yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David I'm is brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website\nYou know talking to David is brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website that okay good that is but also you can leave your a name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes you right in the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\nThank you Roger thanks for calling in with trying to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs for two national parks a glacier in Denali in Alaska and one thing I Would say uh especially looking at an alley the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus no real hiking trails\nAnd if he'd go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking so\nI I Would say it and I will correlate the ... glacier ah they really on the play chess how treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty miles trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can go wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and couldn't proceed\nAh then I don't know anything could happen with the wild animals that would be one thing now I don't think\nAh what's happening is some sort of Charles Manson group that are looking to just fine isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals would hide out in Yellowstone for example I don't think\nThat people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker\nSo I I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening uh but\nUh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know there are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was a one more thing on that is my ... multi theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see in Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost\nRight on the ground myself what it says it looked like something from Jurassic Park so I Do wonder if that ... idea of some sort of ... historic bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know they're criminals pretty much everywhere the humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are rows and rows of weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um you know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database you were talking about people who banish I'm under very strange\nThe cases are generally weeded out of the day but it's database if we're talking about people who vanished I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there was no tracts there's no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people there hiking wet so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nA pretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down at Davis books but I appreciate that thought oh we're going to take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone\nLines or we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and you know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um\nBut I can understand how the elements skinned or can sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the or we're going to go to the break the shell taste take us into the break and we'll be right back\nAnd he had a whole is white factor like he's being drawn to really wrap here and there was like strange noises about the future of like a greyhound\nA hey just walking on an airplane or on a couple of weeks later because we're running out of their bag clean and it never was ever nothing was ever said it's hot and everything you know anything about backyard\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ... of area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least in the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard this story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember a ... this evening\nOr if you guys were talking about a day reply to Sendai you were talking about the skin Walker ranch rent and uh and I literally stood up and said that it and I pointed out the radio because I've read all the books I've read all the full on what books I've read the skin Walker ranch book\nUh and I've been following this thing for some time for several years or\n... was ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of disappearances\nAre a lot of disappearances happened on or near a rich line and I just couldn't walk her ranch that's on a ridge like uh\nLet's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taken no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows when ... somebody's on the property or on around is just to me I I'm just saying to me a at in my opinion I think that you know that this kid walking ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the\nPhenomenon surrounding the Fort one one\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities and that it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals they're here but not people\nKnow there has not been any people are saying but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of the um gouge marks on them other than scrapes or things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do and you read books and stories and things like that but that that doesn't fit\nRight and things like that no no kind of like probing or something and then any land and would do when you read a function story and things like that\nBut that that doesn't fit but as far as rich lines go on and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate or no one ever sees sees it ah that that to me is uh some good strong march there but\n... thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that's a lot to chew on appreciate your calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas or he has a sliding he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome George our age a ticket for taking my call too I wanted to be my experience\nA sheer at a park in San Antonio which they added another channel miles up bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd found is wooded area where even do was they light at the time almost noon me and my wife were using all by slowing down to chart a course I was a little ahead of her and ah we've got to this one area where it got kind of dark even though it was they life but it was so what is that it was\nThe sun sunlight shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was like on on the stump and they look more like a bird\nUp but uh you know you never know I mean it's\nKind of felt like it was like seven feet tall Dixie\nAnd just there and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she's vote and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah so when they saw was just awesome we just\nSaw it back a bit flying away but the wingspan was so large that wasn't enough\nIt wasn't like a regular bird you know what I mean we have ducks and I'm ... and all kinds of stuff and I spend a\nNearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is and so I just want to share my story because I Know we didn't report it to know pop stores or any park rangers anything\nBut why don't we didn't have no evidence of too it's kinda hard to believe that a bird could be that big and we were just two people just riding bikes than a a\n[noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on this animal are\nAll you saw was kind of like a maybe something going on his eyes kind of glowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark Cold War or something like that you knew staring at you but you you could just see a show up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really chilling exact details they especially when there wasn't that this that and I I think the first thing you know I Know what is what's the sense that something was staring at me and that's why that's what made me up and went and looked at my wife and I'm looking at it and I look\nAt that point so I have some second she turned around and just try to fly away so I couldn't really do a bad like hands arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story and that's kind of uh that's kinda creepy ...\nThe chickens and and ... and stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story that's none of that's kinda creepy stuff where she ate the specific detail that you had on that ah wow that's quite an experience uh Jason in Portland, Oregon as inexperienced to share with us Asian welcome\nFlowed George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter]\nNo need your you're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had a lot of strange encounters in my life\nAnd I have a very rational go analytical brain that overrides things and so it wasn't until years later I started putting all the facts together [laughter] so the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\n[noise] that's basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time they bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road and pile up a big mountain\nOf the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again you can kind of hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the\nCoast range and it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down the trail and I ...
