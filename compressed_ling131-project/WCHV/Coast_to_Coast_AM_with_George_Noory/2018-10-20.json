I started working back here in the early nineties and I ended up meeting my wife\nThe mighty ... here at ten ten after we married\nWe had our twin boys who were born [noise] they'll get\nThis the tense month the tenth day October ... at ten minutes after ten ... ten in our family\nAnd of course mom and dad met and fell in love at C. F. R. B. ten ten so there you go [noise]\nUh coming up an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of do a little cold\nAs we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military uh thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become\nThe catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time\nSpeed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so\nThe Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back\nThey are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initials trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact ... said you know once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nIn Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to\nIt's with both Russia and ah the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he does want stability he does want in the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the did China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how\nPeople need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nUh against China\nIs is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield ... is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't\nUh a cheese\nMilitary supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so I have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters\nA but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property in and\nTrump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump and it just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed may is is driven by\nThis Islamic terrorism perhaps an ... in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed me is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh ... this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long\nHistory and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nPerceived as the grade you know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War was the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place I ... in nuclear submarine and you know a ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone courses and the Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a backing down and that given that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and in the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that's in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen\nUh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat in the long term threatening especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with the defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nRight and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with the defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nAnd I was twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators that demonstrates that uh these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five of course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony in border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone yeah\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nAh no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states had better make it very clear that if if we can't back a an article five declaration\nBy even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nGreat a magnitude that hum we've got to decide and dust far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling\nHearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm\nThe big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ... you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect or that the Chinese have\nThat clutch when Clinton was

the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it within Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nA so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour uh because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians\nAnd the Chinese are just you know

road strategy of president Xi around the world\nYes and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians in\nMilitary exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging a so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made air defense system

relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nAnd the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically in that part of the world uh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your\nYour vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government and trying to battle the who teased and others of course the Iranians\nYou know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we see is what I call the\nAlliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans in the Iranians but others\nI think are a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back\nWho knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that I'm Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty was\nAh was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world's leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were ... and I ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I just\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy but he does have the president's year and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a and of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nUm we don't acknowledge it a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there weren't any regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there\nIf Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy warnings about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know to promote\nTheir their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of then I I think that you find that they're not involved with the who teaser not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh into Iran is going to continue um but it it if they're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law\nGoing to continue um but it ... if they're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism which is has a law in southern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them or the Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the ... were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nUs on TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\nAnd I do go to you in ... no universal access in Brussels into us on TV all access for over Twenty years\n\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year a ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but isn't enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this quest ration period which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a furiously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined they're forming a new alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information or I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen quick question Steve is that possible Bob\nWhile I'm not an electronics uh\nSomething major that could happen great question Steve is that possible Bob\nWhile I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we\nGet a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today\nA there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter in the U.S\nSpy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think it was maybe a near collision involved in and I'm I'm I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we're very concerned about a cyber the battleground of cyber as a woman before then I point out on the lines of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today\nAnd yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nOne card line Dina's intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy ... of a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that\nThat's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against you know our key allies and against our interest\nIn those five it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth and will not touch the ground and it will destroy the ram that has the two wars and said that the\nLadder horn is the bigger ... that comes up last them the\nFirst one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIraq that's already been conquered but the last time that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help it says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's gonna be a naval or an air force\nA pack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and um but it's also states that no one will come to her aid or and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with were actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a Congress but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as being a law explained in you know this prophecy so ah and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her\nOr has the wing hoping eagle and those wings will be plugged in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecies in\nTheir uh uh you know summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob Let's say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIt's used elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting it like that you know I I tend to\nYou know of shy away from a uses Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that ah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces\nAre terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card line and she's

been in this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world at all I have never left the country and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat uh something has happened to our government a home in the last fifty some years and it seems as though that a lot of people think that uh\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach uh uh you know go defend our\nOur country's three I'm In a charm military uh in our military really is and our military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that\nWe're not really in control of our government and any more it seems very obvious and ah it seems like a people is a you know I of course the younger people don't really you know remember America has it was you know in the fifties and sixties\nAnd uh they've lost touch with you know would they didn't lose touch it just it was it was never a savvy to them or what came before them in a\nA a you know I'm not the country has opened up prisons around the world can carry gay people I'm not

...\nYou know Richard what's his name [noise]\nYou're ... you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call [noise] well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that\nCertainly something changed since Kennedy\nUm\nBut has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral\nTrade organizations and ah he did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warning against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it\nA ... and this these sorts of um\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable\nWhen you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption and I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have strong\nEmotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism\nIt hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it but the United states yes\nThey they have been involved if you talk about a lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nJust doesn't this isn't ... to the United states most other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility at the United states has they do the same thing but they don't ...\nA power and responsibility\nAt the United states has to do the same thing but they\nDon't reflect upon those so it was dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there is no redemption at least in the United\nStates that exists\nWe reflect we right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call\nA Doug is east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our ... to ... I'm well thank you I'm\nGlad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I Try to get married some time ago a it was a guest host and such as yourself\nAnd ah they were talking about climate change in a warming and ah they're rising over the ocean now I'm not a a I'm not going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut ah they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which uh that is the fact that is a measure of all they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I've never heard anybody take into consideration water displacement\nEvery year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant a multi ... a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're sinking um subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs were sinking old military now this is taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has a stop for some time and that's also taken A L all about taking of water but it's adding land and ah I I think if a if anybody a you know of or any of the guests that you've a hat on or hurt speak\nAbout this uh ever brought up the theory of water displacement\n[noise] uh no not that I'm I'm aware of um\nI I think the type of\nSea level rise that they're talking about is about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because\nYou know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow I'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been ... rising for a very long time or we were in that kind of a trans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age we're still\nOne eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three one eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd a welcome back to the coast to coast am we're talking near death experiences and much more jarring are open lines segment let's go to Dan in granite falls Washington hey Dan welcome good morning\nRichard yes and there there\nAre many days I didn't have\nMy ailment there are many and um I had an ... or something very important\nAll right what did you see\nSaw a guy that for one thing I've ever been so much\nAnd I went through a gamut of emotions I was listening to music eighties even a rather low fat milk pitcher to the girls I have my one of the same you know great the a rural area\nAnd they look at them and I just kind of broke down and I've never been a very Christian whole life I've never been able to handle the pain like we came home home today to me and even though I never I\nTheir pain than like Abby came home home today to me and\nEven though I ... I have such a terrible problems and I said father and there's a picture of Jesus and his father\nThese little ones cannot suffered any more of this cannot go on ...

smiled and days and I smiled and the father who was saying to me it's not going to go on it's going to end\nIf people just don't know that it's going to end very soon\nThey are they're going to be standing in place was lessons are going to be standing laying a sitting in their place and uh they're not going to know that this comes upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that's that's

travel they're not using their actual body they're using their soul or conscious um [noise]\nIt's a a super conscious mind that's what's soul is in a very high state\nAh as for the process of crossing over usually people come to a gate\nA gateway and are they are met either by their guide or maybe a family member [noise] um if they don't cross over or they will either told to go back or maybe they may talk to someone and they usually come back into the body you know near death\nNot a full death experience but there are books written about life between lives his what which I Do live between allies [noise] although most people don't do that they don't call on me to help them do that they rather do some healing work\nAnd some of the things that we do is work with angels and ... sometimes their guide\nSo as far as uh do we\nDo we how do we continue to live\nYes we do a more importantly we can experience happened we can experience what it's like to cross over what out dying by going through some kind of spiritual aggression and going into like between lies and it's extremely liberating and you do get\nTo see what your life's purpose what you're supposed to be doing here you meet a council um who interview you um you go through all of\nA kind of I'm I'm a healing and preparation which are guide 'em before you meet councils and before you go and places or any other places

yourself in that world\nAnd um the there's a lot of a pill a path to communication so there's no facade so to speak is no lying because people know each other you know they know who you are to a lot of soul level because you're so\nRight on Joe let me ask you a couple of questions do you believe in reincarnation top I work with that a law alright what how long typically does someone spend in his life between lives before they reincarnate\n[noise] now that there is within the individual and uh you don't immediately come back\nYou go and you go through a process you meet your guys you find out what life you would like to or they will suggest certain things to you that you could work on and you could come back\nSince there's no time up there so to speak with everything's in eternal now um you can also go into a past life or a future life you could skip years or centuries\nIf the these car washes are on sale right now right this second on line at the veil dollars saver dot com that same
