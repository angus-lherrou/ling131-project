nowhere you with you and when are amazing couple hours we've got to where you hear Jeffrey seal and back with us internationally recognized professionals psychic exorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good go such as spirit guide as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello everybody around our whole planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual and the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about offing who for natural a good and evil\nAlso in tradition at its heart of the time and uh in the tradition of that but\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing\nThat I deal with half and all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also\nBut on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spiritual we'll get to do what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirit ... something to do with that\nDefinitely\nUh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people\nThat have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so there are around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels\nThat powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not to have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are are much better\nEquipped to ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system our emotional systems make us angry at each other\nOther people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits a one\nUh once were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack are\nSo many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate color ethically it's kind of like\nA river that travels underneath\nOur consciousness and they communicate on that level\nAnd they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an exorcist when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's what they can they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nTwenty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked a success if you times for short rations and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you tell was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with their school work in the summer are looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they actually come and started walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they

we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human humans they\nWant nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs the ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred\nAnd they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today in order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're\nWant us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that and Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but\nThe reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicate with us tell a path that could be the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's\nAbility to make money destroy their family destroy their lives and\nAlso ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want to sell\nThey sure do ...\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind\nOf story of uh being\nIn a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially\nGetting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry\nSort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not\nNormally do that and so when we're angry\nThat's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they don't know that there are there and they may not leaving them but\nThey are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after\nDeath some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens when we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and get us to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts added they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of nonsensical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die and it's an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nMaking spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely our own\nOr the under the direction of the double Jeffrey I'm not sure if\nOne particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always rural or they do work in groups I have found that to be true in all the decades I've been doing this\nUp but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs an incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light will come out on an attack I pull out my nonsensical sword\nThey pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on but everybody is not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and a lot\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they\nKnow how to generate hatred and rage and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle it no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible and they have they just hate humans\nAnd so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger\nHe's got [noise] schedule to repair batteries plus dot com\nBombs we'll alignment locals have

catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened after ... board followed me as it said it would and I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated man and I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried\nCleansing my house with stage and everything else um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean

been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein and all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forced\nBe forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent but emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know picking the booming pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy for\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage and these things can become trapped in our bodies energy feels also known as the or up but the orders not just a bunch of pretty light\nIt is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems have an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time\nIn just about everybody everybody has the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV\nOr you know a pubs every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy field to be don't protect ourselves and most people don't\nThat it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes habit\nAnd this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not always just demonic spirit the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that\nAh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nWell uh yeah George or ideas what I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm actually writing a book called the we really know God he is\nAnd I tell you the Bible in Nineteen eighty bag I dealt with a lot of the body a scene and I was gonna ask you Jeffrey\nAre you a Christian I don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous they both work hand in hand\nFirst principle is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels guide you know they create\nAlmost like a pattern of a cake on a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so\nPhysical filled the non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a terminal\nAnd our personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is being fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSwipe believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to to refer another question go ahead Jerry\nUh yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches African beach that God go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nOr this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it's an ... it's the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs deity genes this means humanity in crisis means anointed one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have a nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then uh our entire life we we are and and even Paul says is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nThose demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back a decline of

California's with Thomas\n... charge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey\nGreat work that you're doing Jeffrey my question is about war and the battle field in war zones\nHow tell US military personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica salt I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a place for negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirits as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy fields through our methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural in a battle situation or emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers\nThat can be applied\nActually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take\nThe stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes to the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we need we need protection right away we don't know and things that are going to hit us we need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by\nThe enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also uh off the fear\nAnd so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion would I what I'm involved in is\nInvolved in is not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists to not call me up and to argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body\nThat is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by\nNegative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy\nA person's life a hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out\nThe resources money George to get it out if they destroy a business\nAnd they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place or where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violently and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have the failed business I think most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in or business after business comes in\nAnd you have problems of failed businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well plus you have all the people working or who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what\nThey're picking up on George is emotional energy whether it be good or bad\nEmotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and the needs to be cleared out so they attacked businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work\nAnd now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others\nWith their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique in sun ... son ... California Hi Monique go ahead\nHi Hillary I'm way that twenty eight million back at a hack if I say\nThat you got you on Oh yes ... next here in town and I had a couple of questions\nThat first one

it very interesting that so I'm On the back end\nPot a lot about seeing God he's yes and then and now they're side will talk about demonic spirit here that my first question the second question is

Rome or the from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new bloodlines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings light beings ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies\nAnd face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status\nAnd then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the long ... and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path\nChances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes in your realizing that the scenes themselves were utilizing ancient texts and teachings that they had developed in synthesized from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the address\nThat were centered on how do we contact the watchers one and two how do we transition\nThis form ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings to congregate with the angels the holy ones the angel of the lord\nThe watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the etymology of the the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is ... means that they are evil beings or that they are being who were are somehow demonic\nThey their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will heavenly realms\nAnd hook human body fat is they're great sin they crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over\nFrom flesh into spirit with out God's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they\nDescended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others\nSimply decide that they were\nDemonic beings that they were a powers that were beyond human control\nAnd certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek\nTo transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experience the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing the line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach human ... how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous cloud were gods rude on them to me it sounds like ... we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds isn't to feel which is the world where we get the word and to feel I'm from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of Judeo Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're light audience it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional a and throughout the cosmos\nArguing with William Henry whose latest work the watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative Mitt solid just goes\nAfter these gone that a visited us spiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their bodies are described actually has fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories\nStories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of eyes they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches what the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nIn the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are the the\nOur body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toned fingernails have known nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could could step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency
