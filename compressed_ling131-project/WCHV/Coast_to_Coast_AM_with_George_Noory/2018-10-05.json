I mean I don't know if I classify shining this last year\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty are ah you know the ring is Twenty years old you know so um [noise] you know it's a\nYou know a lot of 'em are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween was first Pauline\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant there's really excellent as kind of like the captain Ahab trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween blue magic and it's been that long like gosh uh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing and skiing from New York and a bunch of other\nGosh ah and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing and asking for your can have a bunch of other uh [noise]\nOr or films a science fiction or he do he the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story\nWas called the babysitter killers and and they were the babysitter killer and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story Halloween story [laughter] kicked in\nAnd uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary math and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek mask and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's ... that's a lawyer Shatner Matt Good Larry I'm I Wonder how we'll feels about that yeah I don't know uh\nBut uh you know ... and so what you know the fact that it's such a blank you know expression on the mask and and and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to heart you're talking about the conjuring and\nSome of 'em there was a family of films there's an a bell which uh you know the original dolled at the Warren are having their a basement full of ah object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and they and and\nIt's just it's it's a you know it no one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the bat you know a much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that there are little ... gonna\nGonna try to possess them or ... birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started to leave that either and that's the last two she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with the short\nHair and she ... Frank Sinatra protege\nAnd that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle want it to make that movie you know William Castle was the producer of course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know all like emerge Joe and uh you know I always see the buzzer is in the seats and the uh uh uh\nYou know all of these uh movie\nGimmicks of a house on the hill and um you know straight jak\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William Castle wanted to direct a a Rosemary's Baby but he had such a reputation doing gimmicky movies that they didn't\nLet him do that but yet when I was a kid a I was terrified of these I mean I I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the\nCoffee table shaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's you know\nAnd we were watching my dad and I I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching the movie the kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature feature can I be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometime\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just hand but they had this very convincing hand crawl it's embodied ham crawling by itself\nAnd I and and um I I I it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that they filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and ... and I'm sure his explanation\nRubber hand that they filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and ... and I'm sure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put into this perspective a wait\nThere this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something to just the torture me this is something\nFor fun and I think it was kind of an ice hockey kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it were ... and not just for all of you know horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the ... a fantasy though uh\nI think the horror or is it an offshoot of fantasy and so it's fine I I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like ah you know monsters and\nThen the robots and engines and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill than when the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\n... house on how to like one of the blind woman and the seller\nMan I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go ... [laughter] well when you just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill assure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and\nAnd uh you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a cult in a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\nYou know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre debts has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is I think there is right you know and you could go back and watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and the chainsaw\nAnd the the how weird their house was with all the the mode mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those are really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get swat are kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because there was no one was going to go see it\nNineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lewis shower scene you would think\nTrading they were trying to get a PG E because they would have thought no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lou shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not one to stabbing did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know what's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of ... there were a bunch of melon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons\nAnd Hitchcock is standing there spoke in his chair and watching the sound guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down having all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter] ... that was gonna say a word in as he's walking out the door he just says to stop a\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out\nHe was cleaning up bomb it every single night job he couldn't handle it because ... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people hadn't had become accustomed to the ... found footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of the sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know when it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but you know that in that movie was a that was the director\nHad final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know it's so nowadays I think that'd be hard to do because\nOf the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a fool with everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right any for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that\nSaid you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream scape which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie the people who should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nBut any on any of them were never they go five six seven\nEquals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the Obama Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bothered do very much it's Australian

[laughter] this this allegory for their depression in their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you use are you one I think there's two there's two aspects to roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to get you get

for effort want to get on a roller coaster it yeah\nAnd they're both fought a and I think that you know you you you you your face you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh

I absolutely love than has been a fan has them was a made on the weekend or the ... the kids who made fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot bans has them and um and when they when a cost to rally or you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year shoot all the footage or the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're\nImitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hark and that sort of blend of fantasy side by an alert you see in a lotta later or eighties films and the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains a full time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers or a Nineteen eighty of them come back\nWith a gold through the fog uh it's just a so good you know are still many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um\nDonald pleasant but I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpet assume Halloween\nBeing one of them are they live being one of them the fog was one of them so\nI mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if this bill\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I think of the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars from\nYeah you have the right distribution absolutely\nSo so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it and the more interesting than it is\nUm the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see the more effective jobs was the last of the alien the scarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the ... it's very easy to over produce or I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protect it you know you look at the second Terminator\nTo uh the flight I think it's very easy to over produced ... I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know it it it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt's ... like a surprise and and if you eat and eat the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead one grand\nA are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films like\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier\n[laughter] really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah\nYou know he uh he loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to check\nHe likes the paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that feeling for him\nA pet cemetery in things like that yeah yeah I mean\nI I like Stephen king's films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean like Dan is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorites Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know\nWhat I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps righty he he used to just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing a and drinking and writing and ... finished you know and and then\nUh you know five hundred pages later it's done so there's NO PLAN going in\n... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again it there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why\nHis books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to its asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nUh you know it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like owns everything to night of the living\nAt yes and you know now\nIt's kind of come down to the mainstream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the [laughter] you know the the rubber ears

intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ...\n[laughter] every day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nThey are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back in the morning when they wake up\nIt's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nAnd I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines or the Iowa ask for example\nOr something that they use for big visions\nSo if they want to anticipate what the whole group should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a

word\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God\nI think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies a suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness\nExperience depths of reality that aren't\nPart of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering we are arguing\nSee that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to get to do a lot of different aspects of the really the supernatural in the spiritual reincarnation and things like you've got some great stories about reincarnation\nOf the books that you roll back in two thousand Fifteen just makes life possible told me about the title with you how did you come up with\nThat well I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra for a film we made a feature length documentary by that title and he was the one that\nI was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like\nMarilyn let's make a movie and I thought well I wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually although the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of the future science you know we see now that all of this cloning as happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri\nDish it's crazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and preserving on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn who say hogwash life after death does not continue when we die ... ... what are you saying\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe\nIs probably what we're gonna end up and ah so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of and light and meant um may end up through in a you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the\nThe threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple\nEyes and I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nIn the ... the skeptic\nThe well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting\nAnd a nice car use a nice guy yeah\nI Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that when his mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this has something to do with her departed loved one\nMichael wrote a column in Scientific American where he started to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning\nWasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work in our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this with all

so many stories let's um want him to step Bruce march or something like that right well in Stevenson was a ... a very unusual psychiatrist who\nDeveloped a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience of past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the\nBiography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nAre evident shawl but it's still compelling our in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded\nAnd he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak remembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a I used to change your diapers\nAll and that it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid started\nOther things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child's grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then uh they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rationed rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence it's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional ... transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalized the rest of it when the name of objective data\nAbsolutely our special guest doctor ... we're talking about the really things dealing with ... how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the Prussians Maryland\n[noise] I think it's a tricky question um of course then ... [laughter]\nThat about you George [noise] um I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they defined God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... well as long as you're ... and ... course ... right hell and damnation ... can\nBe very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition\nWhere there isn't ...

lose ... Alice in wonderland that's almost want to do the show\nYes George armor and know Maryland I'm so pleased to hear tonight what was being said and I'm I have the proof that\nThey raise the other side George\nWhen my husband passed away six years ago she was on the lever it was a good Christian but doesn't believe in spirits and think oh I haven't been listening to you know all of the programs\nFrom way back when ... and his wife and you yes\nAnd I do experience and I don't know who tell them to sometimes no my husband of course who was a nun believer\nI'm sure he passed away about just three days um but before this happened\nOn the service burial service on them still just says he was going down into the ground yeah those farm came up\nAnd view it was wild win and everything it just happens so fast that it's all it took only a few minutes it was very odd now as we were leaving the cemetery\nMy son and the oldest one said mom when we were getting into the car to go home dad came home with us I said what do you mean he got in the car also\nBecause they could just smell him call was filled with his body odor and my husband was very [noise] me person but she had this sense about him he wasn't a smoker or nothing but here comes my son said that [noise] and I just the school\nBut then a few nights\nPass always sleeping and my left foot but still bothering me from an accident and we had that's here is from a skill later\nAnd um\nI was on and said no I've followed\nMy let's put going up in the air and they was my husband at the end of the bed lifting my left foot\nWhile you could see him\nOh beautiful yes yes yeah he always wore his white T shirt visited the neck and short yeah the ten short and on and he passed away before he could get Ninety four\nSo sorry for ...\nOh he wasn't perfect specimen that doctors always asked what do you do for him that he was Seventeen year old man in Ninety three is a little\nI said nothing she does it all the exercises you know and walk and he watches his diet my husband never had a wrinkle on him but George this is this thing he pulled my leg up and I woke up and I said you know\nAnd I looked at him and I sit com that hurts\nIt my foot hurt and he says I Want you to take care of this for it\nYou see the doctor can and he dropped it and that was it it was very upset that I wasn't neglect can go to the doctor\nAfter that yes I have been but the thing is George my mother also came to visit him I said no he lives in non believers that as I told you\nBut they are able to church gorgeous good Christian artist and [noise] but they even taught Sunday school is sit dumpster in such a thing is he told me after seven years this happened he says Alice\nMother came to visit me I said when when we lived on you know I won't mention history but I says why didn't you tell me up to seven years you're telling me he said I didn't want to tell you this I said what was it all about what she stood out the animal are dead and\nAnd he got up and there she was standing at the end of the bed and mom what what is it you know and she says well Tom I Want to know how else is doing because I was six months pregnant when she\nPassed away and she was concerned\nHow might help but snowing she passed away much first she was only fifty for\nSomething to how well do you know I'm not in Cuba for Ninety four good for you\nAnd um the thing is George I had been wind called several times because we listen to you every night my son and I\nAnd he's a believer now like you know it wasn't a believer slide pizza goals but he's been listening to your program and he has changed\nAnd full of wonderful he believes in an afterlife and so he's not afraid of passing on just like me but I have ... ... you know all the children who are there not believers they just go to church all the time but they\nDon't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having just first attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says it's\nIs just you know how would you what were you raised\n... we were raised as just for the heart case in your church is right here right in your heart you know horrible ... you have to go to a certain church never my dad with my dad was a Roman Catholic\nMy grandma Nelson also and they were the Catholic there was ... but he became a part of this and\nAnd um and then they decided that in in his late seventies he wanted to become Bush's dishes I said dad what happened\nHe says because the British people don't go who all they don't think it'd be fighting all the time was when you read the Bible\nYou know it's always fighting on George you know the Bible I I have read the Bible to into school and everything but\nThe thing is this happened to me when I was seven years old because my two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um\nWell I when I was in the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock ... mass on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I can eat also but there was while they were getting dark confession done\nAnd I'm I was sitting there at the Pew [noise]\nAnd I thought\nGosh why am I passed out my neck fell on the back of the computer you know you still I my breathing was cut off\nAnd you could have died I yeah I was that's why not met Jesus I mean this is something that to this day you know and even the priest when they came to get me the two of them\nThey thought I was gonna um but you've been through a lot to me when and when my two girlfriends well right yeah and they came up to me when they came back they said\nOh this is and you know what Jesus was already a stretch and ... and angels behind him\nYou know and George I have never seen anything so beautiful my life and we never had color t._v. sport and well we had was a radiological back into thirty were ... that's all you can search and no\nI tell you what I got it all and colors\nAnd when I hear your call those called in to say they they ... they had been up and came back\nI find it very difficult to believe some of the stories because my visit was not like that I Know what he looks like yours was a good business beautiful George and Jesus just so happened to them\n[laughter] I Love hey we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn was recalled Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things a couple of things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive and so I think what else is saying is um it really helps they have programs like yours\nWhere people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they had these experiences and there's something to add\nThere's no doubt about that Marilyn we're going to go back and take final phone calls with you just a moment in Dallas you keep calling us from want you to get the Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven too long\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for yourself ... ... s U is ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learned to drive with Arizona State university for more information about ASU on line text based at three seven nine one three that's S. T. A. C. E. two three seven nine one three\n\n\nAnd welcome back her final segment with Dr Merrill Lynch limits Marilyn what do you think of mediums\nThere's been some very interesting research some of my colleagues ... and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium as getting information that is accurate as compared to when it's inaccurate\nThere may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out\nIt was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in\nI find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's there's all kinds of industries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nEerie Houdini spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his dead mother he was successful [noise]\nWell I think there's been a lot of fraud\nThere's been a lot of Mr direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so\nYou know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George\nEurope hello George either ... or\nJust ah like I was like a lot of the callers call it ends up is higher consciousness or\nIs it or humanities disturbing because of all our ills and are we going that way is is that going to be the only savior for everything that we do and um that lady before a bottle and she said the\nIt was about the heart and mhm\nI I finally believe it's it is just the heart and soul or heart pills what the soul to do and the soul moves on and I just want to\nHear her say about that and a thank you so much I Love the show\nThank you Joe and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pope Maryland\nAnd the guy that I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies\nAnd I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question are we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity and technology but are more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching a show on the ... cheese and we know that you know\nWe know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nReferences to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor\nIt doesn't mean I'm not hopeful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine the light on that\nI think eventually good beach over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative mobile I Am a little I'm Jewish\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do\nWe want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the amygdala and the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nAnd one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that uh we know as people grow older\nAh there is this concern that we lose memory but at the same time we gain wisdom so it's as though we get these ... faults that help us to manage our lives better\nAnd so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Michael go ahead sure\nVillage okay I just\nWanted to call because I had the story that I have to listen to the Maryland and uh normally listen deal might not ever have anything to say\nYou know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one it was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle\nAnd I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember getting hit by the truck or remember hitting the ground and then the next memoranda have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down\nAnd I can see a circle of people around me weigh in on the ground and I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely an out of body experience\nIn Maryland you have something like that\nBeen like that yeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful\nTelling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own ... instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very a predictable kind of near death out of body type experience and it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity\nTo move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the no women experience the organization of course named after what ... do well big sciences but what is the no wedding experience me\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reasons kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we now but intuitively we know it and that often can be the most reliable",
