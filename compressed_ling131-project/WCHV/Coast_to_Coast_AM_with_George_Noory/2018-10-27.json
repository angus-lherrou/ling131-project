Miller [noise] ... usually the shooter Morris sweat so good for the way down my hair each child\n... Miller [noise] line and these are the shooter more sweat so\nGood about my heritage I over\nHouse of Al Pacino forty seven forty five\nYeah you know the wizard actually rebounded okay for about two and a half quarters there was a a point in time where they were grabbing nearly eighty percent of their defense of rebound opportunity\nBut still the kings had a twenty eight twenty seven lead after one onto the second quarter do and it was Kelly ... break continuing his drawing west coast strict\nIf I Want to send the brain gets rebound shovels the Braves are quick free up front and\nRead the story was forty or thirty five wizard so it was not intentional glass or\nThe wizards would shoot better from three in the second quarter than they would do a whole game and that would take them out to a lead is large you date in towards the end of the second quarter or we saw a marquee Morris continue his strong west coast trip but then also show that sometimes the good comes with the bat\nFor

what the hell [noise]\nIt would turn out the marquee more will get a technical or the kings would make the free throw in that gave the halftime Coraline or sixty one to fifty five onto the third

passes the good old for\nA lot of the wizards just settling for jumpers early in possessions and that allowed the kings to go on and eleven or run to get back up by three but then the wizards would respond in large part because kill you break came back into the game and continue to do damage\nLeft us circle Jeff Greene hands all over and over so I left that what drives an jak guys are strong Dr Kelly oh brave [noise] jak certain joins all over and over I Would not be denied wizard drop down by three Seventy eight Seventy five ... go to the freezer why\nHe really as a murder or something that's closer Fifteen points sixteen minutes off the bench and it all started with is twenty two points for Goldman's on Monday I'm Portland Bremmer number it all starts on leave from\nAnd it was another twenty two point performance tonight upper Kelly who braved the was probably the most consistent performer on the evening for the wizards twenty two point nine rebounds on eight Thirteen

themselves over over for [noise]\n\nShooting eighty five boys regard as we look\nKelly operate with my voice and those were the top but it was ...\nAll right what nine boy and those were the top of the ... century why\nSo despite the wizards not really bringing their a game or really derby game that's barely they took his six point lead into the fourth quarter and you wonder would they put their foot down\nAnd finish this thing off in the answer was no they started settling for jumpers again start the fourth quarter they went cold again a couple of turnovers mixed in the next thing you know here in Fox is making it a one point ballgame\nGreenhouse effect us allies ... shoes or get to go to touch and every bag we eighty five eighty one was a Fox comes up for coverage execs were

five Ninety and then moments later after ... three ... the lead the two it was John Law finding his back or make\nA point the dreamers those blows that don't\nThey don't want a back door slam Ninety

elites who would finish with twenty six points twelve rebound more impressively sticks of ten from beyond the ark and the kings would build believed the one hand one overboard with under two minutes

to the basket fine but I Want to raise a point rather\nHorrible up here the fourth quarter Kagan's laid but certainly know what I'm In the wizard directs just\nEnd the wizards would get a stop on me and spewing possession touched with thirty one seconds left wizards had died out of bounds boy and a chance to take the lead so they put it back in the hands of Bradley bill\nTo solve the amount of

of those threes came in the first seven seconds of the shock lock without ever really getting the ball into the paint making the deep parents work so a bit of a frustrating off into performance for

instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book\nIs ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in\nDiscussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by\nDiscussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about ...\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that\nMakes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we become more\nYeah I agree with you in and I think another concern or in addition to that is that a lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nThat a lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know ... and never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nNew technology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there is a good way in California right there's a company\nIn California that is\nUm marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration in their eyes cites a going away well that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of this technology\nThat that ... aims at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do\nTo the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots\nAnd so I talk seriously about it in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often\nTalk about and science fiction often to pick you know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well\nYou know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know\nThis is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting when I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people that they let him know using that kind of I mean really\n[laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter] yeah\nWell I figured it's a late night shows\nThat's right you're going to lay down and now I can just\nLeave but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know tied to have to say why do you watch a bus or [laughter] but\nUm but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but when this stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers in a Google executives are and and others who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging out in the ... ... lives in ... lose this position because yes the idea of having a bug and house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know he hasn't had that philosophies\nRight you have any ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believes that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nUh you know of what Jeff Goldblum\nSaid in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance ... right they're done they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can is and the and\nThe notion to that for example when you think about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral it leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society it's the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten into their own but not all of whom\nAnd then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance this ... ... it has to there has to be a Darwinian\nElement to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yes yes yes yeah no it it it's interesting or by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one\nJust it's just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and a bunch of other guys and I went up to I said Jeff you know you're always\nLike plane a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere\nAnd I said sure I I'm just\nCurious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he just not just a job and you know he has the ... I was at ... pointed and is the answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in ...\nPhysics at college and now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it's interesting I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance ... it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nWere designed during work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know or you know you're somebody's religious belief five for a moment let's just talk like strict science sure um ...\nWhat what were you learn is that these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't\nThat I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on and the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating\nThe ones that I describe in this book\nOr you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and the duck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know why don't\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just to clarify a half with the stuff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact\nI just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility and and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said\nThey had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human being they had their their chance uh\nSome creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human being they had their their chance you know\nHe blew it well and now here's an inch now let me raise up a little differently if there was a ... humans are\nKilled off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off as opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by you know the fact that\nThey you know some giant bird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so\nTo me you know there's going so I mean I I realize you could make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some like some there are some tiger whenever that if we cloned that there and brought it back and reentered introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nHey my Children's Medical school battle I Want to go carts I ...

University of Minnesota's master recently yet a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an uncle but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ...\n... ... they're sheep human and pick human ... so these are creatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pick DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures\nBecause they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat and you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because\nHis kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom uh bought now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I got to the book bet if you put\nToo much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA\nToo little human DNA then you don't get the human organs ... if you put in too much DNA\nThen you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me gives me a little\nBit like I did we really want to do this and what's interesting\nIs that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I caught one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that does not like\nYou know made up high in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility but they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government is number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age this kind of very um [noise]\nUh you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know well maybe we should just pushed the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines\nWhat are the guard rails for sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it in violation of the unit you're probably doing it against the advice of the moms yeah what do you do your own\nMinds the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then monitor Bello over to the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was ... when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas or\nUsing stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage that the of the are making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nAnd I ... I Would filled balloons up\nWith it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens that's\nThe only I was a little mad scientists in an area to\nYour own space program against their will right\nSee what happens that's like a I was eight of it a little mad scientists in an area that\nCreate your own space program against their will write by ... by the way\nGuys with a ... year right the mothers and say why don't you know I get right not knowing that already go so play tiddlywinks or something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA\nYou ... you know so I just thought I'd ...\nFifteen inning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said that kind of works and so I don't know I I guess it I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... because that's how that's how it's happening but right now it's still there's two men on\nTop of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it so All right Joe ... the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is\nBut I I still you know then they think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm ... you know for ... you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look at a windows series is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... to buy me some you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials are at everybody's focused on that type of assist and I kinda get\nIt but they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and and monitored inside of one's house aren't we ...\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things\nTo worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell\nThe story of a little girl in Dallas texas ...\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me anyway you know there's a doll house the fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless the stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out ...\n... but here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like the echo you know get rid of it ... ... uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around Alexa now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders in the room [laughter] yeah I Know I read so big\nIt away too because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um\nYou know apple watch that they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMay be in there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way\nBut however it happened that kind of the debt ... passive listening that is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our ...\nThat we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationship or for our community\n... ... ... and for the security of our cut the country I've just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly\n... I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so I was saying that I'm ... ... ... the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThat kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on the ... there are now I'm more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on them and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou talk about the show he thing in\n[noise]\n\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we can cause I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass and the\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it to his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walking and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ...\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculated how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm\nSaying is sure that that technology out at this husband\nHe ended up being charged with murder\nBecause of this this kind of a Internet of things that are buying on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate I you know if you watch Netflix they knew that they they download what you're watching when or how for how long I mean\nThere that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than\nWe are well these gadgets yeah and I liked a lot of them I mean I were an apple watch by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing\nThey took it from the real life oh they do maybe they always do no ripped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where\nI mean I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which\nAccidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face print\n'em that they've not you're covering the young and and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves\nIn eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy running with which raises the possibility\nThat you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database\nBut the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and to finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this\nAnd by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we knew it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am keep\n... ... ... hello can you hear me in a perfectly good a knife on getting my phone turned back up to go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I heard you are speaking about the a ... card happened a\nCouple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his favorite experience and service even there's a whistle blower\nI call them coast to coast and before but uh but it'd be great to have him on how to tell a story about a lot of things I'm One of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a\nA heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson\nA worked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a car was at the University of Utah and some Thirty years earlier ... and he\nAnd his career as a heart surgery I had some paranormal experience is one of which was a ... where\nHe did a surgery that a technique but it's never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if us kinetic or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a guy from those instructions said he was able to see in his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like ... did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm I wanted a wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew that we have our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to a tree see who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Steele and\nMichael I got one question for you here where did you did in where did you just stop ... when do we stop playing God ... ... ...\nWhere are we ... we it's a good question I mean are we playing God yet and when do we played God is maybe is another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and ah you know I call a very well known biologist in the book um who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project I'm\nSure you get wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs to now we have to discover the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome\nWell this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote you and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it [noise]\nOh boy I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it ...\n... and this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about ...\n... ... and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your your your pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book or\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that\nYou're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetic but all it takes is one stink\nOr ... and that can within ... right there but with everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God the premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease ...\nIf the diseases natural was as God made it natural and yours is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease or\n... I I I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid the phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\n... that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which you know when we make them better break pad or do I mean there were\nAlways attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area the\n... no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight and the blind with these retinal transplant ... I I mean that can be said we're playing Ron I what\nI like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on\nFire yeah oh totally I Would I was\nThe first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil field a oh a oil fields ... that were lit on fire and the way I had to get there what drew a minefield we got a guy from aramco the Saudi Arabia oil company\nHe knew away through the minefield ... and so that's how I I think of trace this question is I see as their ICS navigating a mine field and you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mind that it's going to do it in ...\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous\n... never mind the great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine ... ... ... as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that won the hidden mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\n... remains to be seen I think that will be the end if it had become that way I Know I met in ...\nMost respected median sales team we're looking for excellent communicated with strong processing and business development

I remember when you're volunteering for drama\n... and uh what was my drum\nYoung man Mm let's do wish I was like man but tonight when I began\nAnyway anyway I'm\nA there are people out there\nThat are in this world that really lousy and I really really really like and I think anyway when our they'll have\nTo know which to\nMe I just walk around and I I\nI and I don't want my favorite is\nWhen they get ... ...\nYeah some day in time\nTo keep you know people that there is certain people that are so beautiful oh it's so wonderful in this world in literature killer for\nIn a lot more\nI think you're one\nWell you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art\nI think it was just it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse\nI think it is you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breast over that we just do is just you just cut us off guard\nSo yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know I think I think he ... he lives in Ohio a stab\nAt it and to\nThis and they quit\nMy father is a broadcast okay cool\nToy and I grew up and I\nYou know you grow up around radio stations trends that yeah that's good I never did that Star Trek\nStuff that have nothing\nBetter to do that I you know this is a very good they\nWere like oh my God this is a\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kind of ... what station did your father worked for\nA week ... del ... and ...\nOut on a ...\nYou so much simply shit I always like to I was like to hear\nThat you got this you have a great night I I've always worked I'm not that technically advance I mean I can handle the one who won and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love this engineers that really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they can just build soup to nuts enough and I'm All right so that brings me to oh Keith from Virginia is back so Keith had called the um when we were talking with our guest less an hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open line so I'm Glad you called back heat so you you had uh\nLast hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have money or for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back east so you you had a friend who ... you were telling a story about how\nThe surgeon had essentially experience to kind is almost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely a deliberate where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand it and uh that individual by the way and and ah thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker and smoother with everything but um somebody very topics that he discussed and and they relate to defend or the things I wanted to say too but\nThis gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a ... you relate to the experience of a failure or twice\nIn surgery which his patients died and they were children and they later many years later and a ... ... visited him\nFrom the spirit world and delivered a message for\nHim to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same rough I'm now from that in at the age of Ninety three ... after having been an apostle for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having less of a\nWorld renowned medical career\nBecame the predators in the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd I'm anyhow um\nWhat I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and let her things in which things revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and fight and from time to time I hear things on the coast to coast\nAm that they're going to be perhaps the conducting information informed that link for about\nParanormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching so that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or have to reveal to him I should say ... by ... a Jesus Christ and many other\nThis or that he had profits and he brought about a lot of ... ... ... new scripture a hatred scripture as well as new scripture or\nYou know and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up to be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about ... and ... I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned veteran recently by Truman naps and there's a very good\nYoutube video Jennifer Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles seem to have\nDone Boston by you know the the church from the the council's on YouTube and some of the scriptures them off that were the basis of the Koreans\nA with a goes well I'm looking at it as a lever holder guys ...\nYou know show somebody not means somebody playing a little game like can you look at me\nLike I'm a I'm Around here so I Want you to notice every now and then you know I'm a I'm going to move around here to\nSee that way uh they mention a pharmacist or anyone at all the pairs correctly and ended up in a jar container so they're all facing out towards out out or are\nThey coming to get to order they were just out of their own fan right there uh\nYeah but that that little of that but moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um\nBut the scissors independence or the ... in this little cup holder district moving around and this is it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar ...\nWas on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I I don't get the thing with the\nThe pencils in the in the scissors so benevolent pulled you guys I'll go with that until\nThey've got any other theory to a a back it up Michelle is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nOh wow high than than I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver\nIn Wyoming on coast to coast day uh Michelle\nOh wow I think than I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver I'm not like they're all\n... first things first first things first thing I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at the wrong I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhat I was wondering why it's like I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that's that's the way I felt inside and messing hair gas Michael I'm closer to when he first got on\nHe was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nThe St Louis but yeah that lady\nTold them to read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't know how well very strong with religious stuff exactly but I'm\nA little bit like I ... I Wonder\nHow often when I'm driving down the road and how we can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um you know like\nI said you're our hero type figure being run a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like pre biblical the tax you know like ... ... his tax for like ... and ... you know whatever creates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the ... you're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birth but a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not\nTrusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the bubble because of how many true it has in it\n[noise]\nOkay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true that we know to be a worst\n... steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know so there are a lot of these stories tell these troops the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest I\nFilled with you know stories that can be found in other places I mean we can still trust me you're saying like the other information on the bottom\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago or other people started in like I'm\nEmphasizing something from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote the things that they said had pre existed\nEyes of Christianity that they started to really promote the things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really\nReally isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition to that but but ... in the end does it matter I mean it it's do you can you do live your life better\nDoes it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science\nThere's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think I'm ... and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow do you think of that that's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nAlong the air to thing sounds good [laughter] good\nWill be a big hope you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you um I go to a adjusted and who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy ...\nHey and it's nice to be on a list of that river river actually called in ...\nAre you going to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect\nBut uh do whatever you up to the more scientific stuff yeah sure\nI'm not sure if a lot of people carpet on mosque interview\nBut he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I know when he smoked doping ... they're\nThey're I think there are a little out there but uh\nI think somebody is I'm\nBetting that logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot\nPretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy and a cyber ... augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are\nPretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around\nYou know we have the ability yeah new deem massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh\nYou know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school where we just make philosophy classes to learn how to properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more you know I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat yeah I think we treat philosophy is some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and ...\nJust a fine arts credit that people just take the right to it 'cause it's not that it's dance you know or something would you do a night and dance and offer you don't have to\nGet [laughter] but you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in uh in his technological ... solutions are big big instant ability\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state from\nOver working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must get some big giant slot machine\nYes some big entity whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I own\nVenus is are you know our money that that's a very intellectual and always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an ...\nI I only Venus is are you know our money to that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after the Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly what I\nLive in a day or something like that won't affect stocks\nWell I don't know that too because I didn't see my argument would be the UN must we I invested in the mosque\nMhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nOn his insurance but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in making a lot of money\nAnd so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I'm sure we'll start going ... and just like watching a Tesla the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome\nSo I'm I I think any time in the head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they lived their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree with you use it to them genius\nI think he is suppose and stuff a little more on it and put on public but I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very soon and future you know blame it on the Web based in June of Nineteen\nYeah you can respect their feelings and have a discussion for instance if it's published that curfew or bed time\nWhen I was just and then don't are down with him or anything like ... ... ... feet to play like independent

sent the age of ... a British born Egypt change or the great flood\nOr Saddam anger more around ... innocent children killed there so I mean like\nI can I possibly\n[noise] or Saddam and go more than ... children go there so I mean\nI can I possibly believing a God like that\nSo you know I guess part of the again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative as being the defining story so I accept what you're saying and I think\nDon't get my point wrong about atheists I I I like I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part\nBut let me just say what I say atheist I really mean and then the strictest sense I think a lot of people live with their life like there is no God and then they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean\nAnd so you know everybody puts their faith in something let me just put it that way

I don't get there very often but one of these days I'll enjoy my\nI'm a Hilton Head only real yeah we're neighbors OK\nWell previous caller brought up something about what you got it off a website where you mentioned that the cause of Jesus like an imaginary figure on the go figure and then they went into Mohammad\nHe was a Lexus asked yeah that's what it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported Alexis then I got to that part\nBut yes he did say that it's all immediately triggered in my brain I bought\nThis perfect set up Encyclopedia Britannica\nFrom the church mouse\nIt's there's a store and I was so excited then when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a first ...\nPark the first introductory part\nIt was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan\nOh wow and that it and you're going to if you haven't stand is you would probably be ... by the data and explain that this was a new format\nFor Encyclopedia Britannica and they created\nSea alphabetical values and they they\nChose what to put it at length in that part and then they get into the other selections at their discretion and so when you look up Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica it has just a few little paragraph and I get calls from them they took a figure someone who might have live during a certain time period\nAnd then it represents the uh where to look in the end or more information and then if you try to do is lower than\nLike page after page after page than the regular section\n... and so you know anything about it and\nNo one very interesting it's very I Wish it was a good look over your shoulder well you're talking to you you're doing this it's\nIn it's in a box there and I just kind of put them away and I kinda feel like like they're not really been like even\nIt's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel like like they're not really been like\nEven come in who you don't use usual usually did we choose the idea that I mean like ... ... ... as you said I I Know there are still printing the must still be printing even you know they don't completely normal and using\nThe the laughter is the second trip to laugh because well I'd have to buy it gave them hung up or at home and saw that and I started looking up things and I want to fly to to to make it this way and so you can find out I mean if you could do home or\nI should take a look at the I'm breathing treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night or I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do that will be in the first hour tomorrow night an otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving so it may have to wait a while but\nMost people do you do but thank you it's really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska and coast to coast am Karen\nHi I'm dismayed and was he was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some get and um it the show was shorter um first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite\nShow host and stuff has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because the age [laughter] he'll\nYou know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just\nYou know I I I guess that it's funny 'cause I I should listen to more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you know you really removed to say that I'm not sure I don't\nKnow what I wanted to change the subject to and like I said let me go along with what she would say\nAnd I'll tell you a few things that I'll get off the air and everybody else can put in a sense where um the Mandela Effect first of all\nYou've probably heard about it there's ... million last memory to\nYeah we'll ask well they say false memories\nAnd everything in the world were members of one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was I fail Evan six in the Bible the wolf in the lamb versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb that a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible and you can find\nA hey except gifts to what I got a catalog in the mail today and somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like by this I don't know\nThrower comfort her poster remember what it was but anyway it was the way we were remembered it so ... Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump\nIs like a box of chocolate Sally\nField you remember when she really liked me you like me or anything right now\nThey're saying if you watch it now says she says you really liked me now\nOkay that's a change when\nKnow when she was saying the encyclopedia how you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus in pages and pages them all on that\nLast night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that third baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know portal into another dimension\nMurray think demons into our yeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside that place I'm\nI'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and Mohammed the biggie 'cause we all know what he does\nThe outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing he says now and and Mohammed the biggie 'cause we all know what he does you know the things he believes in any way\nThe other things and then we would do still don't be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you think about it because you know nightmares more but here's here's what I Want to here's what I'm proposing to do the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam in about ... about Mohammed\nIs that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this and that this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember in a way to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whatever we may have helped we might have originally thought of the line ... ... ... was ... you know but the more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples\nUm I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this ... ... ... you can't do a perfect translation ... into English from Hebrew in Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek\nIt's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed and some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns been people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by ... dropping a permanent and putting a person's name id\nBut others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore [laughter]\nUm and so we have to find just quibbling form facing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the\nTranslations keep changing that's great as we'd all be ... I Hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it correct which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who is in Tulsa in the time we have left on goes to goes to Marty\nAnd for a pleasure are monitored um first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit the readout button about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on leading right\nI had a and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in awhile I bought you uh had disappeared forever\nAnd I I'm not", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "27"}
