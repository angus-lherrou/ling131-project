transfer\nDo you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invitation only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm\nGenerally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these Akron as ... and\nUm when that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sink which is a ... a ... brain synchronization\nTo kind of technology plus guided meditation and we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow he's like a cubicle or ... and ... declined or well hell no it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad\nOkay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus action like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flow chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou hands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and the control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nThey don't feel alone because you have headphones on on yeah\nNon on you know they they're listening through headphones\nAnd he exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey friend who's been several times on wet when he and he thinks he is the minority and went into a data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course\nAre ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by Nora will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on the eastern where would you and I knew that pattern that you think people see it it kind of a formula right\nWell there's a yes or relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression that are used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided\nOften guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate\nTheir own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for Russians mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo our inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I open mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore\nYour true self and\nTo open up to that awaken too that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what questions could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this I write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise\nYou everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you\nOr imagery because information can be transmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to their\nTheir true self and the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that\nPersonal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you\nBecause you guide your house and then I mean in a way your experience you William have died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend my friend has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered\nSouls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure uh we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean assistance or that's\nBut that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well\nAh where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that\nHave died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm at\n... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA\nTragic incident and national tragic incident were masked is still you know one\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences\nUh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time\nUm that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way a marriage and you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body is gone ...\nI mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and different cultures\nBut and then I went to two we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can that goes for all the\nTraining here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nA very logical way that's um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is

and get out of money for me not to the trauma that to an actual workshop sounds fun regulated out of body creation thing [laughter] and it sounds so\nWell done very well that is something that lean boom in his land for almost twenty you really don't think you can do on your own we live what are the culture has this existed in history\nOr Lisa from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people's had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit if you look back through all the biblical text\nAll the transformational type of experiences people there are there consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the way it goes all the way back to ancient Hindus and Buddhists text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was\nBeyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can an added tiny and validate life after light\nWell it gives you that infinite number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake any 'cause then they realize oh my God there's\nI continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience and it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are [noise] think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue where they're going to death they\nDon't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume there are human being because they were they found themselves in the human\nBody mhm but in actuality consciousness uh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a love and love\nPets six cetera during our out of body experience is that and the pets are having out of body experience any new ones that have consumer already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book were my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that ... I mean these this is just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for\nA very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body\nGovernor without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed\nAnd you're doing this face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself\nAnd really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death\nAnd um he had\nExpressed to me after fifty years of doing this\nThat\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life after death exists because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who have experience\nAs a life after life ... ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a ... right is not you know for sure yes\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books\nStudy research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic and it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get\nFrom one out of body experience because suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that\nAll of humanity I think is moving towards I mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development it\nPuts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist up and saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that randomly coined the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a afterlife that that is what I Know what I did my own Google Search on\nI just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million searches come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder they always have been good enough for the place

I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nFear is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population out and it still used today actively unfortunate way\nControl um ... you know societies or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared and ... that is one of the ...\nThat is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose boom you know that you know my God\nI'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and forget about tiny problem than in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way\nBut surely they are insignificant when you compare him to how vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond your body yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama and and you understand there was a bigger game at foot here you\nThe big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his aunt or uncle news that we\nHad our heads ridiculous that's and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that would occur because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really to the all be connected to only the ones who want to be connected to [laughter]\nDo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we know how they're going to take another quick Brinkley and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls 'cause he'll say to give us a call and I only think I'm listening to cook because damn [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell come back to the coast to coast am Ryan Lee cigar\nAnd my guess William Bowman is joining me his website again is ... in so dot org now are we have ... ... ... sure and has to go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jeannie when is your question\nOh how's it going great what is your question my friend I'm\nCurious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question question you may not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... coalition a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not interfering with your like every day memory of needing to recall a certain things that you use all the time so to speak like we're in stuff like that and driving things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years or so I I\nOh I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike AT T be I Would be associated with memory and on and and um she's when you have a brain trauma that not so much the out of body technique it doesn't\nJust served their brain memory patterns and All right\nNo I have not seen any correlation for that I um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and\nLives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say\nSo if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie and added money sending\n... ... in them than I can relate to accomplish something woman trying to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah ... ... myself poll or whatnot with my phone so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself to out of body tunnel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of drama or brain injury we want to avoid those they\nDare not signed no no\nUh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do\nA for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death but the two were actually even though ... obese are part of the near death experience there also independent of them\nSo it's important distinction to make\n... interesting um I go to Dave in New Jersey and allow guideline for Dave how are you tonight\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right [laughter] you know\nThis is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up a place called ... town Pennsylvania\nWe moved there when I was about to when I started getting visitation that would this visit patients they gave me um I first saw a ... a day account for the school where I felt that it was getting my hands both days\nWhere there's a there's two girls and their mouths with in charge scaly\nIt happened to ... with the what I saw her life before add the Dow but off they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar own\nFascinating very cool so can be BP content is ...\nIs a cat and um there are multiple um experiences and reports of\nPeople that have ah let's just say knowledge of offense or not only in the past but in the future or what we perceive as the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nThere is no time as we know we look at time into linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes it's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it then non physical reality it's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of\nOur true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause it everything functions and a little different than it does here are and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in along it makes you appreciate it and we can you asked in going into and out of money sitting and media destiny question or\nHow does he get something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your ...\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I tried to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nAnd there's no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained\nUm there's literally no limit\n... but you have to ask yeah it's great\nTo see if she did she are a wildcard line to berry in St Louis Danny how are you\nHigh Lisa thanks for taking my call I had a question\nYou your guest um years ago while we were out of town I get that we're really close to the past subtly while we were out of town and um I I wouldn't call back and I just didn't let on my lap view of him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was at least but at the time and that was chasing the suspect through a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing there who right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad\n... and I said to him I just said dad\nAnd he he held those hand up and he said you need to settle down it's okay and uh I I wanted to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I even said to him I said dad don't leave pleased Elise and he was gone and I walked up\nBut after I woke up I I get stressed that everything was all gone in I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from beyond you know life after death round settled down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind\nOf contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual pass\nVigil passing the the the chance of contact is incredibly high ... and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid or contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nEach town very healing\nYes it ... and then it is\nVery healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to the father in waiting you remember him rather than any casket and I think that's a really wonderful intention in you basically did this technique without intentionally and thank you for sharing that um [noise]\nBut remember home it's where the heart is no matter how big or small that's

[laughter]\nYou know innocent but then uh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew ethics at this time next okay in\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered\nIn scratch marks and he was bleeding\nOkay he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had cut the ear off of our cat\nAnd he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew I'm Sorry he\nKept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had a ... beach and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name\nThe one that died now the one that did not like me anymore right and before\nAnd before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\n[laughter] so how did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you and I just I mean even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that oh we\nHad no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties\nAnd like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's silly stew he\nStole something again you know and I might find all my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway it was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or men knows I'm just\nGoing to say that what what we ended up finding out was that it was a good sign up for it all it is it six string we strongly haunted still I'm ...\nAnd you are still living there no milk no\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level\nAnd we took the doorbell about the batteries\nOut of the door bells on the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving as crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what would happen to her\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen on a ledge was voted number six\nOn the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the Lizzie Borden house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post who would buy something like that ah it actually you know what ... talking about how about true\nBeauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist a Buddhist retreat\nAnd it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the houses happy again so I Am really\nGlad that I Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ...\nExperts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really works\nIt apparently it worked because it's it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating about a hundred\nYears yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later\nAfter you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was so haunted [noise]\nAnd I won't get into that right now I did find out\nThat there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in\nPrint or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and\nI'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to\nEat [laughter] no he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy\nUntil I knew I wanted to know what he does his friends know young my mom's to go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter] oh it has to be validated you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live\nIn ... springs right Joes little the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right\nYeah oh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies\nAnd um so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak he he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of manatees springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my ... this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid\nYou not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these sacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas\nTesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over manages springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone\nAnd you know they have birds have a little piece of him type crystal in their brain and it would be he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused because\nThey were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like\nDiving into buildings and and like kamikaze pilots interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest definitely water I'm listening to coast to coast\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there were a house in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just ... do you\nUm\nI think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that's the natives actually hurt the town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter]\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and\nI Am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail\nWalk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this for your own body\nIt was awful he ... he was suicide come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um processing\nBut they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artist answer singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first\nMoved here and I see it happening to other people would I've worn them\nMy a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he\nWas only here for a week and he you know the the spirit of mandatory Wilber took him and he goes I can feel it I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well he got to be careful though he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it\nThat [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why aren't they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is on his own business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and um\nWhat do you say that I can you would have to have a lot of anger to be it to be tethered here\nUm if you are a full of light and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and towards the life um\nYou know you got a good point there you'd these beings want just each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by us friendly spirit I'm like give me a great\nThere are no such thing as a friendly ghosts Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they state that's a good point\nIs it's true it's true and and when you messing around with this okay it it it can it can lead you down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nWell our own goes troubled\nAnd our online that I Believe so I think\nThat everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her cross over by\nWriting this last book and I have that that's a matter of\nFact is that been forgotten jails have gone on both legends and lore of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story is true I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter] pardon jokes about it okay\nAbout it it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five\nI was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was little kids so I sometimes just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone [noise]\nOkay so now flash forward to thousands sixteen I have written for books on got both legends in lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels\nAnd I out of the blue got a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue in those historians out there might know where that is but only a historian would know where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the\nThis place you know up in the mountains and I'm like why would they called me I'm three hours a day\nAnd furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm company right back and I said why in the devil are you calling me is your contact number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a man that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave him my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house\nAnd I said I got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater [laughter] I call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way\n[laughter] really\nNext morning I called the mayor of this town on most of the name I called the mayor I called the theater I Hope everybody could nobody could give me an answer\nNow did you do have that voice on your side\nLet everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known\nAnd I call up and I said what the devil is going on with this and she listens to the tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it and she went into a trance and she ...\nInto a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind alone and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes\nBecause he is very sad that she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her\n[laughter] you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not kidding you so I called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ... I think I'm Crazy relation to this message and she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by himself all alone watch the theme is closed in the winter okay and I said well it's no than her and she goes\nAnd the woman is called the green will be hosting it's forty third annual helping hands practices are on Saturday November third for nine AM to three at Rutgers elementary school come shot I selection of handmade items from some of the areas most talented craft or [noise]\nThe Charlottesville women and minorities business ... will be on November age from ten AM to one tea and I think every school city center Carver rec center register at W.

about your heart health\nOr knows no more than you should consider cardio mobile the MBA cleared personal EKG device for Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your

garden of the guns in the areas near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this building completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this ... this and that was like three million dollars right there [noise]\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded they actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building\nAnd I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that\nAnd it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air and not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do looking\n[laughter] isn't that an omen\nI don't know but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nRight to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do there again yeah we do not somebody with a concept\nNo right to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't build their again yeah we do not somebody with a concept\nI mean there are certain things to be said for the history tours and things that are being done in these he could land ... or ... being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that lead to the land that be and I give there is a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave and nice you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou mark summoned to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs I'm always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of gas uh-huh I Am\nStories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to move to a transition want to move on already\nYeah see I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings\nI think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe that's ferret lingers that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not those\n[laughter] um other stay\nRight up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move\n[laughter] it's usually owned that particular place not\nSee eye earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now\nAnd that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history and anyhow\nThe other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they weren't howling like going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a group in time in a quantum physicist and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the burnt so [laughter] it's gone yeah\nI Lived in time makes more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we mean by that\nMeans it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense didn't have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and it ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask me\nAre in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's like\nThe body around that you could ask me\nWho are in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say it delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to see\nRight right so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it [laughter] I Swear it works but would you ask I\nTell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these ghost hunters that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you ask this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those tiny is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both in fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world a possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw see that's what happened to me when I was a child\nMy parents told me that it was because they dropped me on the head when I was a baby\n[laughter] imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] because\nOther people have had it happen enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now which do you started this wonderful\nConventions paranormal convention travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a mood movable fees for like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historians\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of and he does we're here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologists [laughter]\n... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese two when you do the ... you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do\nAnd on their after Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites have before my chores I actually do a prayer and a meditation on after the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so that too hard to change night by night and you never know which is going to come out and play quite interesting\nDoes that do say that specific date and time and all that you think are not as validated\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tour okay there are always different they always\nChange because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nBut there are some that are pretty consistent but I think it's much like fishing I mean as much as I go fishing sometimes I don't have the darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes he'll it'll be hot you\nCatch it on to go like goodness All right we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back with a listener own cause any ghost experiences are
