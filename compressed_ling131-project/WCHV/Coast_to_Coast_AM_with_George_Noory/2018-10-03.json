right now Steve welcome to the program\nWelcome to the program good to have you with us\nOh very good night to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate we would just wrapped up in New York well what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduced climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair form of a prime minister of England spoke bond Ki moon from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nWho the rain man the Wolverine spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred and thirty five million people were reached and three hundred news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would uh and and a lot of folks there I think believe\nThat if they change a light bulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe\nAnd George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are I have never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's a real pollution we need to fix that\nScrew it I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles I think this this planet has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere in anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflate ing with a cold real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nThings like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide the mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas\nAnd when I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress\nAnd they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing that he was a computer model or and or within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nAnd just three years later we had forty one nations and the European\nA community sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that uh the world's kinda jump to conclusions quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine and then the second factor though is I think ah\nThink of much of this was being driven forward by momentum by money uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days I've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust a post an article and CNN quote how to show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had a one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun while I thought so too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England the the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade we've had attempt of degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change he bloody hands\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\nWell if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what was Hurricane Florence\nLast year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas\nA we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida but if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states these are this is really nothing new\nNothing new a hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve Steve's website linked up at the coast to coast am dot com I spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for iPhone in now Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast\nTo take your calls next hour him regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title for\nSure well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green box of sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first of the four horsemen of the environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy 'em and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools\nBut if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's fun to read it say a colored paper back in a\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper by the way for its size it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but they're not going to put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\n... with climate change with what's happening I'm I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you gone\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning on a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the coming into hydrocarbons instead\nWell you know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the ... theory is because most of the oil that is\nThe oil that has pumped on this planet each way way down there oh yeah a lot in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you've got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but\nI Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality had declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death and the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural\nRevolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate marina number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children and they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd to benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross in Philly can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in junk strength strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was in ... in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at how homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dump them or you wear a pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation [noise] ...\n... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a\nOh actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then as now starting to trend down\nWe're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we touched on before um nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide\nIs what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food it's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that were you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor most the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three as a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution and so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nYou talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ...\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a a Scott Morris and take over as the\nUh the new a minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario

well you're right indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve the entire planet should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and\nAnd you know all we can do though with with these things is adapt that's what we\nThat's what we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but what with weather but not on a global scale\nI'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nHow to British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nHello man that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it a George ... your knowledge first then if the current ages the information age use or are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect I thank you Mr Gura them I say I am\nThe Lone Ranger [laughter] I have lost most of my credibility\nKiller researcher but people think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing ... there's [laughter]\nIt it it's a boom warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know save my balls or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard of before but now the big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like Mr Gura to address this or the Ninety thousand cargo ships at sea they're pumping\n[noise] [noise] Mm sulfur [laughter] to the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em well there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly furry dirty fuel\nUm and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization on shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower so for fuel types\nAnd a lot of folks in the industry think that it's going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime um there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little or improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work and then working as a nation was the international maritime organization\nThank you that's [laughter] that's it they're predicting that the the increase is going to be a huge uh in the next several years by twenty fifty you've no action is taken the increase by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to Bruce in Portland, Oregon Hi Ruth go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi how you and your and thank you for failing my blank spaces that I\nHave no control over that ... okay no I'm Serious\nI'm begging is I think we ought to pay it forward um right now and if they give us some kind of a of a plan that they can make our world more free I'm\nLike my aunt paying it forward now putting our technology and in in a place where we can\nBring our energy to where it can be free for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it and that might be he is asking if you are here donate you making our our uh dams in a ecosystem better and I've done that\nWe're looking at it even even the little people out here like me and in band is bigger than I Am can pay it forward right now\nI think that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nAre just about I think it's almost Ninety nations set of ... that have a form of democratic government so it's gone from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law limitation of slavery\nWomen's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer oh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse and we've got over population we've got pollution we've read all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nGee what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford it\nElectricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it what do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because\nUh we have very low cost electricity um [noise] a crisis here in the United states they often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe of higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now we're the biggest petroleum producer\nBut why should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're\nEither not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during equipment whether [noise] and they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nHold on Steve we've got a break come back we'll talk more take final call

most people want answered\nWell um there are many um [noise]\nYou know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir\n[laughter] you know but the funny thing is\nThough they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish and in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority are so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm are they concerned about\nAnything [noise] well they've you know back in Nineteen Ninety the uh United Nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and the low of too tense and if you put those on a chart\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the\nThe rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York he used to the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nA state of anthrax thing show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but [laughter] well our skins\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just had a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warm\nThat that was supposed to be a week and that was working with a papal cut our data and all of this thing\nSo I I relate this to a\nTemperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that a second question would be a political climate you know ... ... talk\nAll I talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a ... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the interest and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they'd cut one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial and he's already got and blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post and then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or an industry or was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate uh increase CEO too if you look at Chanel ball\nThat's still only buried at still lack of it's not a bank contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place all these years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you got to the point right now and I'm a big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you've got a whole bunch of things there I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they're the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of them out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um the thing you said about ... ah ah what's um let's see\nThe third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve is a need to be able to shut down automatically we still have plants and most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems and if the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan than we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was um\nSatellites well you said something about governments and what's your question yeah I'm\nJust saying I I think you know ... or undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of a arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we got as an exploration from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in render a useless that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica note of big bunch of ... south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue this many many\nIt could be an issue there's many many things that could occur um again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is a nice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got against Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age birthday who knows Walter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say great to\nTalk to you once again George thank you sure you're out with all due respect Mr Gore on sounds a lot like a doctor Tim ball ...\nGeorge with all due respect to most of them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited at all I think George I think it's just common sense about the human population on this planet cannot increase out in the NIH them\nNow George we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern library culture I may have eradicated a man on the ancient a bane of law of nothing but a modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat that\nAfrica the human population is driving the yellow ... just as

uh\nYou know I I just think it's common sense that the human population now\nCannot increase out in the line item\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points wall but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there

I think some people misunderstand that I did a little disclaimer inside the cover\nAnd it was kind of a play on words but uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works over worker fiction and the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world\nEvery thing\nAbout big foot is fiction for the most part what do you go before say the Patty film or to date after the Patty film or most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod\nI mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about a UFOs\nYour typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face\nListening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive ... book any claim that he shot to ... ... and had them and of course\nI don't know what happened the guy mhm you definitely don't know what happened to the recorded do what what are those kinds of stories in your opinion on Senate or made a\nWell you know what are we talking about George we're talking about one person\nAbout one person it's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof [noise] yeah\nI Believe that these people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it\nAnd I'm thinking about it\nThe man was not being paid he could have easily just shut up and walked away\nHe didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know ah he was reporting what had happened and the fact was he like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise]\nAh haven't seen that they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions and so they buried him a I've had\nA couple of encounters a where animals had been killed was said to have been killed one of them are wasn't self defence\nAnd ah this man felt this thing was going to kill him a and\nWhat are you to say about that am I to say you know you're wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if he'd like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things here I could\nShow we will do that and we've got a break coming up in a couple of minutes sure the ...\nUh like I said I have some people are who have seen buddies a couple of guys say they have shot them and as far as bugs are concerned I\nThought he knew his firearms I thought he knew his uh bullets\nOr it didn't seem it seemed very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down south uh ended his neck of the woods\nThat do go out on these night Hans a I have a couple of uh accounts with guys were out hog hunting feral hogs are which is becoming a big problem\nDownhill it's huge it's right and uh\nThere are people actually being hired out now by a farmer's land owners\nAre because they're in fear of the children are getting attacked by these boards and whatnot than a hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf carts so they could ride around rather a stole fully\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide\nBut um [noise]\nPeople feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down a thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as he kind of realize what was going on he saw a big flood looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the two Trump the guy is ... and the big one\nLooks at him and he went oh\nUpset him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot and the big foot took them looked at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you or that is most wanted most on memorial story\nOr if I heard that it would have discounted are entirely however having said that I had a gentleman that was knowing in Vermont\nAnd he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story while you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I always had suspects about that a fishing store but ah let's get yours when we come back\nGo students ... the new version of the coast

coast to coast here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe the brake on\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was pulled urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd ah he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping on the side of the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up for dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late among the rock and\nHe turned over Detroit we're gone now\nHis first instinct was that a raccoon took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happened to me fishing connect quiet river or wherever I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow I had laying up on the side of the river\nOr I see a raccoon stick it\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought\nSo a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at almost ground level\nAnd a huge hand grasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grab numerous fish\nAnd retracted back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that it was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level his tent was set up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make his way out with a canoe but he had said that he thought it was a big ... obviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand standing out of the bushes\nAnd then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly\nAnd other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nIn ... and was\nAble to know that he was fishing saw him fishing short when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where we could get up there to get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of fish missing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe\nAnd he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he caught was not a raccoon at all and uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people describe the creature in terms of height neural big hobby\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a and I had a ... point\nHe had yeah a lot of people say the comical shape Ted there's varieties of a a hair\nFor coloration ranging from like salt and pepper\nChew a lot of people use the term or burned or read a and then of course brown and black so there seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost ... very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the nth degree type of body extremely muscular\nA veto chest you know Bolger thighs you know just like a a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and it it just varies a I had one I'm a one story called the tree stand a incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who's twenty five feet in\nThe tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet\nAnd this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is it seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was both hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd that he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grabbed the heel of his boo [laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong in this measurement nobody sits did trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ...\nI don't know Seventeen\nSomething had to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boots\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked about would knocking that the people are here in what's going on with that what's that's\nWell you know this is one of the things that we we see on the television a relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nOr they apparently believes that this is some type of communication are between big foot you knock they knocked back with the signaling each other in the woods\nBut\nThis is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves of the woods knocked\nBecause according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a a semi pro landscape photographer [noise] uh and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty seven teams\nSemi pro landscape photographer [noise] uh and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent the\nTwo of them were walking into this area to take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line\nFor sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing it for twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional at any rate there in the valley\nTaking pictures and there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock emanates through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up in the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around and sit through a husband\nI see something pacing around over there on the hill fried and\nHe says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside to lay\nThe legs so he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it and he says even though was so small in his land at the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up in the air I'm like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a howling wolf puts his hands by its side just like you will I Would do [noise] patrol voice forward\nAnd then they hear the knock you know what I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue against through your mouth\n[noise] you've got at George was like only like you know a thousand songs allowed him\nSo he said\nIt wasn't a knock at all but it was more vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with the its role it's tongue its mouth who knows you can ask them questions but he said it was not a knock at all\nSo then that was really interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nIs it in your opinion is is it a blight gr ma'am\nI don't know George I you know ... aren't you yeah it's ... it's its own thing you know it's\nAll you know like in in a blue walked on Ford's very rarely will and he walked just standing up right it uses its arms and it's not colds yeah on a move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really yeah uh I mean people have encountered them are hitting all fours\nWho would look like a beer to me did that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift\nThis is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate but his new wife for his birthday for balloon\nRod you always wanted one I got a he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter] so did you [laughter]\nThey came one day went uh to meet up with this balloon is out in the field and uh he was scared out of his wits but he fought through it and they went for a ride and he asked the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of linked to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said they were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and ... and what\nHe is what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight they will all the people in the ... with them by the way it was like just him and his wife to probably five or six people and now\nThey got to a point where the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over all wooded area so that the gun Dole low was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know ... trying to grab a leaf off the tree and all of this\nThen he'd lifted it back up again as they made it across the next ... field\nHe did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree top and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who carried on in this scandal\nBut here where the big for comes in when they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out of the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nAnd everybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing they kept quiet and you can't control the balloon\nThis fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking in the deck on all fours and took off he said it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRaise you see that's unusual isn't well I I mean you know\nHeard of this I I have a story and one of the books that cold along came a spider\nWhere these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of a federal hog on\nThese guys were Hong Kong thing and they were sitting in a field or coming up on dusk waiting for the songs to come down the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass\nAnd the grass was sporadically patched and all the words that were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass\nWorking your way around the field they saw what he described as a furry army homemade sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome all black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass\nIn spurts similar to like a spy to want to move quickly and stops moved quickly and stops\nFinally they catch this thing\nFor him with like a spider wanted most quickly and stop motion quickly have stopped\nFinally they catch the sting coughing and opening between two patches and it's heading toward the hard that they were looking at which we still far away\nWhen they came into the opening a hit it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the heads sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's go read into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way toward a hard\nAnd as they were watching this thing is going up and one that stood up they knew it was a big for it and they made a lunging leap like Superman dive on one of the horn [noise]\nSome type of quick won't run on the ground and the lack the field with the hog under a\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program could see community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it starting to get exciting\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything you can send them so they can learn more\nWe do George we're going to make a special offer it's our latest sky high silver report the report is a twenty dollar value but your listeners get it free just call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\n... leaders sky high silver reporting don't miss out on the solar revolution it's free with no obligation call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back our final segment with William machine and we're going to take the calls but William before we take calls where do we get the book Bigfoot terror in the woods\nUh the books are there's actually four volumes the fifth one just came out uh they're available on Amazon and pay them back and in Kindle format\nSo you know you can have your druthers whether you're a a candle user or if you like a a paperback book which I kind of ... myself I like to feel the pages and\nTouched the old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup\nLet's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nThank you George structure you hear me okay on yeah we can\nThank you we have to ask questions first of all if you've ever seen or Ford or to make fudge that were captured and killed him and so rainy and around a little clue shattering the my goodness this thing really looks like the real McCoy\nThis was in Pennsylvania now and I should go clean shaven they\nAll in this one may caught up in the other big foot they have them and and the second question I Would make sure that your little some men that shot a big what happened after the break ... was shot while we go down like I should have what kind of weapons they have\nWell here's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an ... interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the\nFinal grandparents had died in which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at that time\nUh that was set up a\nAfter Roosevelt pet established a uh\nUh that was set up a after Roosevelt ... the uh the protection of the parks\nAre they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities in ranger stations so they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become on national parks and they will regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted demand off of this caught and the other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes\nAnd grabbing guns shooting at a thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment now that the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seems that shot gun fire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the fist into hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both by rules of a seven and a half lead shot\nAnd he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big puts being shot or in my account called the fifth bullet\nThis guy was hunting in um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him\nAnd he ran across what he described as a quanta taught me that sticks he said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lent itself\nHaving this quantity of sticks and branch Paulos oh bows and branches formed in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting\nSo his initial thought was that hunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was sooner change\nOn this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this rich line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke to the babysitter ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he level the site on it and pumped around over its head thinking he would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movie one now\nThinking he would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that that\nAh cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was\nA posing as the police officer and how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nLoad is gone fired a second round dad he was sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept running\nHe fired a third and fourth round and if things kept coming at him now was closing any squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why in the story the bullet and it finally drop and when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round\nHe got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shoot this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger or this things coming at him like a bat outta hell he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them\nAnd yet when he saw it lying on the ground he can see that it had been wanting to do is multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it\nBut why these things can go now we all know if you go hunting if you don't have a move ... or email or deer if you don't get a good long shot or a hot shot some type of solid organs shot these things can run\nAnd hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot but these creatures it seems like to me\nYou are going to take one of these things down it's kind of be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... or something\nBut sadly then you have to take them now\nWell I mean what are you going to do George rhino\nR. by the way I looked at the picture than Eighteen seventies series Bigfoot\nOr they didn't have photo shop the news you know very very intriguing picture they got a couple of these are all hunters with the ... uh they're holding him up\nUh he's obviously dead bloody huge huge huge huge I mean you just Google\nEighteen Seventy big foot shot in Pennsylvania in the pictures will
