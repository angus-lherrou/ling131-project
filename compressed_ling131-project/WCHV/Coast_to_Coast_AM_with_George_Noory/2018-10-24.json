it isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong in country and ah operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with the Rand backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or are they a rainy and who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God the Shiite um religious militia [noise]\nI'm a\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two um Lebanon as you know of only ... between the Sunni the Christian and\nThe Shiite population for domination of the country and the Shiite were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leader of um of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the emissary they than intelligence specialists and they felt revolutionary guards and\nTo live and on with theory of blessing and they said of faith in Lebanon and they establish among the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many inside the country I'm for them I interviewed a few people\nThe many state within in many states that was very obvious to many inside the country I'm for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists the crime in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected is this a rifle and the amount of money the amount of influence of uranium through spreading it a little bit on\nWhere the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as el ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on the u._s. embassies and the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nGeorgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a character some history\nA this had never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild a all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing\nUh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um\nIt was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred uh but I'm also a a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley um\nWe we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us\nWhere he was so um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a heck of a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nNewer get into the story you want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of ah nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and on the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon\nOr as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region\nOr why we need a footprint uh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nOr and or or take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz their book is going to be rude rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Sam you're with your book be rules you get more and more exposure to what's happening over there in the if you can see him in a couple of minutes we have\nAnd hopefully Fred than Samuel would you be rules you get more and more exposure to what's happening over there in the if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um\nThe the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power um Hezbollah has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties um the period we're afraid and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalists suicide Shiite brand of terrorism\nAnd it has emerged and she'll probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it has for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to fill up there um I ... I'm strategies\nAnd tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm In two thousand six launched\nA I'm a horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege I'm way of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it is involved in narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically\nBecause it has it\nFor cells and operatives in this country has\nFor many years and it is an arm in and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important the U.S national interest\nCountries of course work through straw parties we work with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash in arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting tough with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stop supplying them well we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily since\nOur hostages were the is that the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which\nWas um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nStart hiring with Lincoln jobs today go to link dot com slash working to get fifty dollars off your first job that's linked in dot com slash working for your fifty dollars off terms and conditions applied\n[noise]\n\nPan welcome back to coast to coast red Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that the Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after you Ron militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting and the four um policy planners in this country for generations it was directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing\nOf the end of the marine\nAnd the kidnapping of a CIA station chief\nSomething that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped\nUp until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor burden tell us about what you Buckley a bill was a a a true patriot George uh he uh [noise] grow up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalist we're talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story due to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly\nCompanion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh I'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star\nAnd are also a Purple Heart I'm at which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nNow than it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets a hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to\nA but regardless I'm\nA he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know didn't surprise me because of ah the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a\nAnd goes into special forces are and I'm also a associated with the CIA in that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD or cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know you're known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so [noise]\nUh that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the\nUh the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so a bill is not a in a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um\nIt you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meets niches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are\nAnd Hezbollah grabs them and uh they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around\nIt's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security\nUh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch or CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was a you're a single ... you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for water bug Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and\nUm I was part of the hostage debriefing team where are we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and visa button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nThen it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for\nAll my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period [noise] um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks\nUm and we literally that could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating\nSo are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was a ... at one point\nOr the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhile I'm which I'm not you certainly\nA smoking gun or as to who is directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's call them accurate or not\nI I think it's I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley um revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature um station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nMore into the tenth grade decades career pathways asked them mitigating the dot edu flashing college\nDollar saber a guy with another money savings the veil dollars saber were opt out I was the vote car wash in Charlottesville for their plus washed package that includes hand wash vacuum clean windows\nTired shine interior wiped down and spray shine twenty nine dollar price tag you always have price fourteen fifty these car washes are on sale right now right this second on line at the bill dollars saber dot com that seem bill dollar saver dot com\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ...\nSeven five and am twelve sixteen do these\nMorning I'm Brian down with\nW.

Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's not just about land a part of the issue is fighting over the holy land itself

way\nToo late or if I'm Wondering if you should've had um you know the the second burrito I'm forty years after you've hit the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the experts the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula\nVast um you know it'll that\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians can be an end to go shade of peace like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and\nThat is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nThe state of Israel was um a lot of creative the Israeli DNA dictates\nThat the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force and the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory\nSome sort of\nUm he would Jima moments of raising the flag\nWhere they can say that they're ... that their opinion there equals that they've achieved they've achieved\nParity and both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood\nUm are are bent ... are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action for is the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks and milestones can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempted\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George morning hay bright\nHey listen a man what a what a mess over there in the middle east and an end Sammy you had to write although horses are wrong\nAre no good over there I Am not a busy rail and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is a must William Buckley this is the forgotten\nAnd it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is a must William Buckley this is the forgotten history that nobody you know really remembers but\nIf he gave up secret in I don't know if you know be good or not was there any trickle down collateral damage\nTo the field office of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up and keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question [noise] sure a good question\nBrian uh the answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all the personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a slap\nA they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAnticipate the entire source chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down safe houses ah where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time [noise]\nSo those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario and you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or\nA operations were are certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a year entire um human collection network a which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims that Israel\nHas vilified her as we're getting on on short on characteristic ... I'm I'm a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities\nFighting in Syria um\nThe the\nLebanese fighters in in in Syria have played a significant role in in ... being able to the Assad regime being able to remain in power on Hezbollah remains\nI'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've outpost\nSome throughout the world including South America and um has ... remains a clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\n... why do they deal with the cartels are that are in South America\nUm yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina in Colombia in Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um um ... we learned that um\nTina Columbia Venezuela a in a previous work that I did um ... we learned that um\nThe the government though I'm president majority in Venezuela um had a um a shuttle service on the Venezuelan um airline traveling the math and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way it goes ... and then from Lebanon via word dispersed\nThroughout um point throughout the um Europe in the middle east um\nMoney the money from the cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of the on current in the United states um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs shut up you know ... you know clinics to help people but legalized drugs don't put people in jail or will stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all the Germans drugs and distributed them what do you think\nOr a large a large portion of his ... budget comes from um\nIllegal activities and I I think that you know when we think about that we have to remember that more important than the religious elements more important even\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get excited\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything you can send them so they can learn more\nWe do George we're going to make a special offer it's our latest sky high silver report the report is a twenty dollar value but your listeners get it free just call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nYet leaders sky high silver report to do this on on the ... revolution it's free with no obligation call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred and that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\n[noise]\n\nNow we're back with their final segment with red Britain and Samuel Katz their work is going to be rude rules are website linked linked up at ... dot com Freda want to get your take on these ... situation of course and uh\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed at the consulate butchered uh yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia a but geez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time and now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah\nAh disposed of somebody's via similar methods that we are just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates or\nIn this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility\nOr with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world are you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and\nSo ah either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now that curious part to George with this this uh based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for\nA there appears to then a few other ah Saudi princes that have disappeared too so um\nSince ... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and ... so uh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi ah outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of\nThe royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented\nUh to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of\nThe royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here or didn't he put a lot of royals away at the Ritz Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did\nAnd you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or or just arrived there for meetings or a which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum\nOr I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with\nLiaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos a there still are an intelligence provider no\nThat that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are uh at times [laughter]\nAh I'm a ... sad to say and it's just the nature\nOf the business uh you know some of rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those are at times work as smoothly as a\nAs most people think\nBecause remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services so that's the one monitor that you learn and and basic agent school is a there are no friendly intelligence services and each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\n... apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer Adnan ... uh there was so big you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event uh\nThis is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe ... more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know wasn't one of these cases where uh you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe\nPaul when ... you know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do\nDo these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person who said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish president that's that's the one given yeah\nQuiet and hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish prison that's that's the one given\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx slit is going to start a Tom go ahead\nYes and I like to say that if the lane is a horrendous caper is Yemen I mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name\nAnd how can you are or how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take as a and make it a temporary a hot when the of the was\nNot for oil and that would go nuts for silver but for the sake of humanity to stop the gas and from a sending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing has to\nDo at least stabilize it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made a mess had to Libya\nAnd in the ... that they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think I tried that Tom but it's it's failed miserably so far ... of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course was no Boy Scout we hated the guy was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid a you went straight gave up his nukes and his new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it

about it and talk on the radio about it\nDo you ever get any calls or gas that deal with some ... muscles\nOh yeah oh we love talking about London was of\nAh especially down in the Bahamas special around a place called hot tech a which is actually the Navy's area fifty one is actually in the Bahamas and the middle of the emitted triangle in fact a lot of us so reports down there we love talking about\nThem something's happening where St Lucie these lights down there the bottom floor the ocean and then all of a sudden this object just burst run out of the ocean and often goes it's amazing\nThe ocean is a good place to hide in you know if you were up to a you know who knows what a lot of secret weapons and so on but\nIt's a big or the ocean is is it not that there's been a lot of people who think that I think that it may be UFOs come from the ocean you know they're you know maybe that's just one of those uh another thing that we can't possibly understand right now but a lot of people do see them\nWhy do you think people ... or so fascinated with the unusual in the paranormal hands you show my show I mean people love stuff they can't get enough how come\nBut um I think it makes our lives seem a little uh less than every you know it makes them a little extraordinary\nThat these things happening around us all the time you know we just don't ... that was the head of the book came from and give us a haunted universe that maybe maybe we live in the universe where everything goes wrong and the other universes that are supposed to be like as everything goes right maybe we're in the one that you know um but um\nI don't know I've always found it fascinating because you look it day to day life it just seems like there's a real pain to life and then all of a sudden you know some of you know she's a goes to someone you know I've seen a UFO and and like it's just that kind of unreal part of life that kind of touches you and I don't know I just find it fascinating\nYou think people need to be scared bats\nI think they I think a lot of people have a need to be baffled you know I Do you know and then you you hear about something and you look into it and you\nYou learn a you know something that you didn't know before I think some people like to be scared you know I think there's an adrenaline rush and that's why the you know the scary movies or horror movies are so popular\nUm I you know who knows I think I may go back to when we used to all sit around the campfire and you had to make sure that you were aware at all through the night so something that doesn't happen so\nYou know who knows but you know ... you're right a lot of people like it or in all forms of at the medium\nAnd we ... we want to be because you know we want to believe that big foot exist as a creature that it's not some ape out there in the woods we want to believe that you ...\nBut he exist as a creature that it's not some ape out there in the woods we want to believe that UFOs come from other planetary systems and it's not just some\nFluke of nature throwing off plasma balls or anything like that or if we want to believe that there's an afterlife and goes to the real thing we really get disappointed when I you know the reality of some of these things pops up\nAnd you realize well this was just a natural occurrence or or\nYou know you know some kind of electrical discharge and the clouds or whatever it was\nIt gets to be disappointing doesn't it\nShould because then you know once again it it it makes the uh let's say illusion of life young seem ordinary in a way you know that that\nBut they can't be an explanation for everything that's the way I kind of look at it you know that there are the things that happen out there and certainly a big pot of all kinds of different just strange things\nPeople see things and you know they all can be making up they can't be hoaxes or we have ... the book where you know hundreds of people other than people thought different kind of paranormal type stuff\nSo that has to be something behind it maybe it's all tied together you know I'm Talking about this on the show a lot that may be big footing goes in UFOs Loch Ness monster all all thing all comes from the same thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about it a lot [noise]\nUm but it's it's an endless fascination with us in with a lot of people\nWell and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making up the stories that they see ghosts and your clothes and big foot you've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very unusual in that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nUh-huh Russia it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda molten how who's a reporter Mac or she's an expert in crops formations and a truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources other than men\nAnd whatever those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way and I I've told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one is the unusual one it's amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nAnd absolutely for sure and I are like a ghost story you know if you could talk to if there's one person was come back here from the afterlife that's it was amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the UFOs is a little boy were you raised religious Mac because there's a photo of questions that\nAre not really you know I I grew up in digester which was the kind of working class out of Boston you know we were we were Catholics and and I you know life kinda revolves around the Catholic Church and the school and you know and so on and so forth but not all not overly religious now\nWhen you were you out there when Albert DeSalvo the Boston stringer was out there doing his thing\nSame neighborhood and I'm Sorry to say but\nYeah I thought so I thought what an amazing story that was on the show\nYeah and wasn't he a family man\n[noise] uh well he had a ... kind of a not a drifter but\nStory that was on the show yeah and wasn't he a family man\nA well he had a ... it's kind of a not a drifter but you know he um he never really held a lot of stable job than a lot of people think that he didn't do it that he was actually framed by the cost because they needed somebody to um you know to to arrest him because there was I can remember it as a kid you know it was the headlines\nAll the time all the time you know this guy yesterday with a lot of women right in in a little area and um [noise] you know there was some key stuff that he didn't know about some of them are in a size but who knows but one one thing what the jail they did stop so\nYeah they didn't stop and there could have been a few copycat something new to me that's true they're always on the lookout for those haunted you accumulate the stories for hunted universe how did you get them\nWell uh you know once again had you know boxes of all this different research in that for a while I work for them because they're at Torrey um website that was part of a\nTrue TV team yes uh-huh okay yeah they were just a sign me to you know five Fifteen an odd story is a ... a month\nAnd that just you know I I bought lots of books on line and so on and just accumulated over this ah filed in piles of these strange stories\nAre you still finding new stories Mac go all the time yeah uh-huh I'm sure\nThey don't stop and I'm sure you've got some favorites or after we come back from the break rules we'll talk about how the universe and go through some of these stories\nWill have time for them and then we'll take calls next door as well um and I'm sure you've got your own favorites don't you\nOh I sure do yeah uh-huh\nAnd unusual once I get a lot of strange calls to the radio program ah there was one where a police officer cold\nAnd he said that they had a cold that there was a heart attack them in the house and they got there before the EMTs he and his partner\nAnd they get to the door and the little man opens the door to let them in and they go rushing in and they see on the floor the body of another ... man they pulled him over they turn him over right because he's on his stomach they roll him over and it's a little man and let them in\nA while they turn around and that guy is gone in there he is dead on the floor\n... stories like that [laughter] it makes you think wow what's going on\nI got a call from an EMT who was on the scene of an accident and she was a she was not working now so she stopped her own car got out went running saw the body on the side of the road\nWas looking at the body sees somebody standing by her car and said please call nine one one it\nWas the guy that died\nWow wow yeah and and they I mean you can't make that stuff on it

exist\nTaking us in the eating us\nYou know it's it's just it's this idea that ... and it's been bouncing around for years is that you know we as the you know the\nPopulation of this planet won't be able to handle the truth that there may be you know being some other worlds are out there and maybe visiting us I Know the wheels Winston Churchill during World War two someone gave him a very detailed photographs of what they called foo fighters back then but the UFOs\nAnd he did not want that released to the bottom line released yeah that's right because he he thought all religion would fail that that was his reason\nThat you know while religion is based you know earth based and if we find out that you know we're not the only ones in the universe\nIt put some new questions on um a lot of the major religions so you know can we not handle it I don't believe that I think they were the vast majority of people on this earth want to know what's going on want would like to know that

benefits will be suspended if you\nTalk about these things I Know people my own family with all these things you know and what we would like to see is some kind of you know amnesty for these people you know they have the Pentagon say okay if anyone who was threatened not to talk about UFOs\nYou have a blanket amnesty go out and talk you mentioned the title wave of new research that we get to do when all these veterans felt free to talk about their experiences um\nYou know maybe some day that would happen or who knows but we do hear that story over and over that something very odd happened to
