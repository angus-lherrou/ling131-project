affiliate\nIn depth radio news talk ... last night I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction is more like Ninety Ninety years old so last night\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability\nMediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods Houdini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving\nFor unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at that\nFour days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThan more than two years after his death his wife best attended the sands conducted by medium psychic Arthur Ford during which for allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by\nHarry and bass initially best stated publicly and assigned and witness testimony that she believed Harry had in fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the chaos despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nI had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in\nI just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yeah it's\nA ... was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nAnd they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got\nSo much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of hair his mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes I started to talk overview um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act\nOr on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coated method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods um\nThink we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words\nAnd the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and\nEighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... ... what is the last two digits on the coastline and they these were rich and pray answer say now\nThey just on the coin and they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to and verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but how you doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would've had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases pray answer say now ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I Know\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is\nAll already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people were saying it's on page da da da da da da and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out an eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nI ... and the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there they'll show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten words and how it's used\nTo form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and down that see I hear Eisen bullet points about this that\nThe code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word rose about that the secret message within code the word to leave and the actual\nSecret can word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask you this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry\nTo ask you this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because\nNow we get into the say on and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and one of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWell I'll touch on that in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because bass and Harry loved each other so much\nI think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask them questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and\nHarry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in this and putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of\nWho d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nHer vitamins and enzymes replace the nutrients cooked out most commercial dark moods\nHe gobbled up all night scratching his shutting is minimal and it is such a pleasure to have my calm relaxed non shedding how the back and I have to think of for that\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to China for help\nEight five nights for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight one thousand I N o V. I. T. S. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com or Thomas tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium who had reached out to her\nA so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works the spirit named Fletcher and\nFletcher is in touch with Houdini and\nAbility for the spirit world communicate to our physical\nWorks with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her up well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this pen\nKey words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married\nAnd this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and So Harry Potter Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know did Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the ... name for best or was this common knowledge it\nMight have been known throughout the close friends um\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet because I'm trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ... and\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher do just that showed the word believe they used the secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look and be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements\nMade to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only her three witnesses one\nOf them as a representative of the United press another one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming\nScientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\n[noise] yeah I think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New Yorker graph or graphic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't know the\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him and she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about at well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in\nAny way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social ... go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you\nKnow I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time so\nArthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this\nYou know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this fast\nIn friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this fester and she was tired of being ridiculed by your friends being labeled and not\nUm and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if\nAnyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the\nWater and and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nTelling me downtown from\nVisit our website in the age me\nOn rock star registry dot com naming a star is perfect for birthdays romance or memorializing a loved one for fifty four dollars nichol three hundred to eight to thirty three thirty three per visit star registry dot com you received this time was gift\nWe record the new start naming book form in the U.S Copyright Office for over forty years we'd do three million stars for royalty celebrities and individuals worldwide call the star registry eight hundred to two thirty three thirty three er visits star registry dot com for the ultimate gift\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ... seven five and am twelve sixteen\nThe morning I'm Tim Johnson with your WC H.

they really want to but it's really I mean that does this\nRight All right it's time to do is it's like they lived in the clouds but ... happy not contracted polio\nUh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed the trajectory of his life that you would imagine it would but also his politics talk to me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect\nAh I was not necessarily you know the off me and I'm not much social personal but you know when somebody\nComes down with instant pop relatives to the point where we can loses their head and they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing ... bars over over the bed so they can use their arms and then dragging your body to try and get themselves will walk every day of school when that happens in them you know the hours are\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in on I'm going to actually work he started to identify with people who are suffering and who are needy loses a gigantic twice a humble pie it actually changes life\nRight I mean he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had two daughters and stalled out in front of liberals mansion and he would\nThey have some of these races and he would use crutches and he was just incredible but it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg\nAnd he was dragging his off if it's the the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs and then from the parallel bars closest we're out in front of a A R\nAnd then he's turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and you know I mean if this is talk about ironclad well I mean that's that's that was that was a was really something else a ...\n... want to come back that that part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters with his wage even met children and other people with other selections and that's really impacted his wife to identify with people in need and suffering\nSo it really changes what for sure\nAnd then the the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a sort of a sudden they'll sketch of of his journey to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInteracts with a White House scarred as a liberal Wilson and turtle colonel house actually who Woodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was\nWoodrow Wilson's won't be like they didn't know that at the time if he was a it was it was a hostile and playing and um they were followed it all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it really is that what it was just a great time yeah\nI mean that's ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just a great sense and\nIt was through at um ... house and I'm\nI'm a few hours connection with the system secretary in the navy and from their intended to use a ... million and that the political connections in New York to bunch for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a it was a jump to the White House\nOne and he asked them to come out of the time when a\nBecame really some of the things that I Want it to do\n'em over want it to do but\nYou know he would like to hang a\nCooperative very well with with with some of those were his ideas and um they don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and\nYou know start at the he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realize that the that old isn't working you flip and when you know with a socialist end of it and uh you know we're ... and you become like a bunch of suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had\nA such a debilitating disease polio or for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWithout against the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he made a very cooperative very sympathetic maybe you don't just like today well uh [laughter] it's like today without whether it was like well if you can bridge I'm\nSure [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely lost in ... when he gets a free pass as\nWell be a total of between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back\nOn it which all history basically is repeating repeating itself with the Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible are like happening again and known known catches it you know they felt they help\nBut how is it that uh that no one sort of you know notice store or said hey wait a minute\nOr president does not is in a wheelchair or you can barely walk is he equipped you know this is the thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago or ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their cameras shops well and actually I Would hope people on the edge of the opposite end of this was a guy who said\nHe would he could really think done four or five thought processes that one was that was really really really I'm Joe what do you do is easy like with ... someone one arm he will leave the room and that helped elect crotch or any or something at the time he would appear to be walking\nA couple of steps so they they could I just you know behind the podium use a little bit different than the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well so they they live in a to ward off the fact that are in case anything just\nShots and you know they they are remarkably well so it or to ward off everything you do get paid in a church dropping to go out with your claim that you know I was experienced ... and for X amount about\nSo I mean propaganda in those oils we're back down you know it's just\nMaybe it was smaller and easier to have other things so on and on the on the white at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um\nIt's like it's just a couple of 'em or destroyed the toys eleven had changed debate in which the president was going to be one in from march coaching\nSo you didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rules or at a waiter take off for work\nSo it's mystery thing the hundred days and they thought it was a hundred

greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAnd Kennedy of course um [noise] but FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banks system it failed and it's just sort of paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty good uh you know the president preceding Hoover going and of course when the roaring twenties well go you know I'm you know things were\nHad a roaring economy going and of course and remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe were starting out starting to be able to afford luxuries in the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has this is explosion of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of health for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the government pay check\nAnd um this was the ... experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then a New York city or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we can have this\nCradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had you know fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communist instead of ... I'm Sorry about that I hear the noise the\nPitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUh um actions that were enacted a\nIn in who murdered FDR and I'm just reading here I'm In the emergency banking ACT Government economy acted beer wind revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority ac securities act aggregation of gold team in class homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I was\nI'm happy to bore them with your [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that and he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either to disagree with America challenge them politically\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of salad did it FDR did it by ... Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great wars ... you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so ah they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nThe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWhere were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat a ... it was a ... because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's music playing you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the lend lease program he\nWas moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the access powers and he was giving them to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because you start to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no\nThere was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point\nWhere he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries that have them we have spies too are spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe we'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo when the book you argue as many as ... and a half that that NPR New Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or when he just sort of glad it happened\nWonderful books on just about everything\nThere's also Tuesday on friday morning story time for the little ones and other residents to answer for movie well yes there are free movies of all kinds every Friday for the kids and they're even no school today movies hall I like no school today movies of course you know\nThere's also moonlight madness or the winner\nTo Dana right on over to your fabulous\nBook sales starts November first\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ... seven five and am twelve sixteen do they use\nMorning I'm from Boston with your W ... local news first your top story the daily progress reports that aid Charlottesville circuit court judge has ordered a lawsuit related to the rag amount of natural area to a judicial settlement proceeding Marin County in the city of Charlottesville are at odds over regulation\nFor a lawsuit related to the rag amount of natural area to a judicial settlement proceeding\nA moral county in the city of Charlottesville are at odds over regulations governing the natural area which is located in the county but owned by the city the county has rules prohibiting bicycling on the site while the city previously enacted an ordinance which would allow mountain biking on the trails that rag I'm Out in\nThe lawsuit has been going through the court system since last year and James you Brian was an R.

in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all of them in and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents are declassified and then you can really go back and really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders and call me crazy\nSo you can really go back and piece together the snippets of of what was going on so\nI'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nOr was the largest by Iranian and American history thirty three members\nAnd that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything as they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another notch he's firing eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked Jillian targets and has a stake and they were all caught and they leave each one of them except for one\nSeven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but\nStalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt is I'm White House it was and it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day people think oh this was Seventy some odd years Seventy five years or whatever what have you\nOh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who was accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House and uh the the Russians had completely infants\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely and frustrated at the White House and we'll talk about that I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo he'll give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House so some of the economy and the ... year\nOh well the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth that came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were\nThere were hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials and left the White House were knowing communist starting with Harry Dexter white all the way through the elder us and they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins was turned out later he was\nFingered in Nineteen Ninety you know talk about Harry Hopkins that are at length later so they don't get bored on the way it's more common [laughter] um the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find\nThe agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee so I won't bore you one with a laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were\nYou know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know I obviously\nEvery FBI couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races and the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth and uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt\n'em through the ah CPU essay the Communist Party the United states of America which is still in existence by the way and with I mentioned that or not and how they Hopkins is down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help the Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute or he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards was\nFingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up skiing and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified Harry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen\nWho is contacting a Soviet Union about uh the the than on a project which of course we all know was a nuclear weaponry\nSo here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around the FDR so so the point where they he goes to the Toronto\nHere we have I mean there are informants inspires all around the FDR so so the point where they he goes to the wrong conference you know I mean ... a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt\nMeeting at these conferences there was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin right information right he had plans in the post war world of taking America was have communist anyway he had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with\nHim as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but\nHow this all happened was prior to this of course this is a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to 'em\nOr directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors he knew the target and they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work\nAnd they went to a city in the city is names escaping it home and it is are listed in my book\nIn the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was cared for and how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities Tamerlan was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway you had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go\nUm he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil empires\nYou know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and sprinkling by style and smiling as the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish in his wife was incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution and he ended up they just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he used to keep\nThe party's journals and use the column comrade or was it come Conrad index card used to call them a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a

the air or anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it never ceases to amaze um and I just wanted to take them anything because people need to know the ... you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and a three hours is a long stretch to talk so just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so\nI'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much of the post\nWar world is a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your\nPain forty four when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt spray all condition or and and um\nFDR really didn't know what happened to you you just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference\nAnd obviously he's he's he looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um every hour as being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of toys\nAnd let's see we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs\nAnd go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I [laughter]\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in\nThe tiny Marcia Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient so this is what people actually it would just start looking into it\nRoosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient so this is what people actually we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was convenient that\nFDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nI said you know wait a minute I've really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral navy admiral mcentire his personal mission and a cardiologist Dr Howard ruin they were they had\nNo idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these cats they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for the ... they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and\nYou know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in the symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors emmer Ross McIntyre\nWho's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a surgeon surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died\nA Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nI he was chief of cardiology emphasize though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled\nAs because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first time that something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would go normal and then it would go with Joe warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving\nHim so we know when they when they got to this point they said look at you know\nForty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again and we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they sent him to the doctor of the day Dr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines FDR in March in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out with is is a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this was a dead men walking\nAnd do what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR as being slowly poison styling style and got him I can tell you that\nI'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world after yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world\nUm the United states Great Britain China and the Soviet Union so they could all police there\nAll right he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share of the world was I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac look at what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho was a big died that was part of the negotiations team in the U.S at ... ... on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aid died conveniently also on the brain and you're in\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was pile Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe from the Toronto confidence dies on this ship\nOf a cerebral hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he gets back\nA short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also in a Mac and talking to relation to the doctor Ross mcentire he dies of history real hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is more free rat poison and its\nCoalition pays less voter lists and its circulating over the place is a matter of fact style and got murdered with rat poison or for him from ... from the internal is governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay style wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman you want it to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nAnd Saturday parking is free [noise] Thomas Jefferson house district will take blocking patience for anyone who wants to get their flu shot clinic will be dedicating every Thursday for the

I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt\nHad was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with this um and she commissioned a private investigator to\nDo you get to the bottom of his death so I Do know that um\nThe private investigator hit a dead end all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from a locked filing with us though\nSo one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor and a ... [laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote so\nThe uh the book being um the White House physician and that was a Ross and Ross mcentire were they in on the murder habits only new idea I I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorant maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards\nWell immediately afterwards well they packed up the uh um\nRobbins and shuts off and they threw Lewis Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with\nThe day packed up the uh uh uh Robbins and shuts off and they\nThrew loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the plight that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death um you know why\nI don't know why would why fleet a scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas\nThey break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas\nThey break the law to bring him to besides the\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it sort of a thousand or so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know a lot of this besides that could talk you know ... and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him being built in being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo nor did by the way and no one involving\nNo autopsy Nolan balmy it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that have been a murder that they've lost over um Warren Harding\nWarren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published\nYou know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book\nI mean is that the volume three perhaps uh let let me get the calls here ah and he's in Alabama and the wild card like any good morning locked the cost\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about ... music ... well several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and parents from nine now\nI'd also like a nation that can experience with the blood dancer scribes from my grandmother which was watering eight ... ... things however it looked like British conscious blading now in the body if my PIN number\n... ... talk and anger and from\nThere you go like you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it thins the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get\nYou know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or a cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but you know my parents\nYou know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something real image and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of blood and are so\nRight my late father was as well sure definitely cause ... any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my New York\nMy Hi there Matt Good morning ah okay as quick\nA sleep oughta and I'll listen over they at first I thought I heard um\nI'm a gentleman on the air I heard wet said top ... who also believes that FDR waste waste it and I'd like to know if he is familiar with him and his theory around it\nA second and what is it the grass and so he would be someone that would talk about that new deal a new deal as\nAs um uh doing the right thing around that that they offered to so called Great Depression\nAnd so I like his thoughts on that and lastly ... about both of the Russian connection and they are both FDR and if a towering stable genius if you will and the White House\nIs saying somewhat different because\nAh with the current administration it seemed to have more to do with leading up to even how he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter writes in Saudi Arabia and I like him to elaborate\nOn ... and and of course the odd that do see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has a ... and and\nWell my if I could just jumping in because we're not talking about Trump I think if they choose not to put words in your mouth but I think it would be kind of positions\nAre about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to ask you are where we could do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth but and you're right ... ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on about the new deal\nUh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing is the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go because I Want it to my knowledge has never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helps a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so as far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was going to be in a little facetious as to how\nHow everyone is in whole history you kinda repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how\nWe have the [laughter] we were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country it's it's really it's really something ... you know he would it would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think the point that you're making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN is nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow old the to the history of another red scare starting to repeat itself all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history\nRepeats itself becomes relevant actually um\nAnd here we are Seventy some odd years past it's funny when it comes relevant actually interesting Booker thanks from it and I know\nWe will ah we're heading into a break here at the at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of us we can\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back well Steve you any they are lined up are ready to speak with you so let's try and move quickly let's go to the wild card line yet again John his Long Beach California John good morning\nHaving me real quick thing\nOne uh if you look at a at Roosevelt Nike or if you look so bad I I have a hard time thing that\nThey had to uh to I'm going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry make room in my room for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't like the second of all I don't read up on this path\nGot rid of Henry Wallace may prove with your bike for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think you know the lip\nBack in ... I don't I've read up on this or I was fascinated with tall and how I got away with all this stuff when Roosevelt died dollar that somebody to look at ... body currently\nAnd make sure that uh let's see if he was he was calling because I'm tall and did a lot of that and I think he would for the story was that he would proprietor he wanted runs dealt with cooking the rate them over the calls that the\nIran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of the tournament I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's dollar one of the debt I I think he did not want to want to deliver quality properly ...\nThat's just my my take on it All right interesting John ... bad shape you're going to die anyway I think All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have bone slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting that what you said has been he look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it spills out very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who researched this and I learned from every one of them I'm not going to sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as style in style in one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the ... in the in the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being there that that was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting you didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of false propaganda\nI John thank you that's an interesting point there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning locked the coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr things just are banning it in your research for ...\nAh did you come across or anything about this just a ... an attempted coup against a Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a to happening and that the coolest ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler and that one of the people involved was a I think it was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to happening\nOr if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSomething that you discussed in the book like a ...\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did\nI'm In ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is with the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who\nDidn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capital is to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me but I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great and I was into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so\nThanks for calling I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I\nYou have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\n[laughter] I like James thank you for that way and he's in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to cost\nAmerican ridge or once on who you can do your job do you feel good return from from Niger married\nWow that's very kind of you to say but it's you know it's great gas like Steve who who make my job very easy\nRight where are you guys for American minister um I figure the Mars commercial back in the day to Mars period and commercial where we're to talk about um roots caramel goof chocolate or just American the American or commercial services through ... through\nCriminal [laughter] here I was almost getting hungry Wayne and tell you had to bring up Churchill [laughter] I don't\nKnow I Know ... the written word [laughter] order here um\nWe are close to ... gifts on years go on ... ... exactly what I'm Talking about this gear was talking about and make it a very compelling ... my ... my\n...
