cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other comes to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten\nAnd very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do and and and that are so no I don't think that's a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what you see in the movies\nSo commander data upstart trucker see three arena or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person can do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting\nBut that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really looked\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't\nFollow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like didn't apply\nCancer or something like that can be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world um you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right who\n... run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you get a low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you do\nUm\nAnd and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get any may not even\nExist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh\nSo who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are a had the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nGovernments that do you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and that sort of the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just said the technology is at a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something it decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of building built obstruct profiles on people I mean\nAll I'm saying is is it is it is it a potential way to use this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb terror or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh and now that that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAlright well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does is\nWebsite is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nDial never missed a detail of the show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we're not shunned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person and twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's\nYou make artificial intelligence work we dodged just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\n... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess him on the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's it's one lives in zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off or at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it ... it goes like this series is there's this rumor\nOr that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to this library in the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message\nThe last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since [laughter] perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the librarian understand Chinese those ... those the library and understand Chinese did turn to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow the librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of the term in ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know what it's playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not\nOr by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people\nOther people say if it can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIn in his just mind boggling and it's getting even been or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where in a very simple short and they double in power\nEvery couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those you know you have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it if you think about it the Internet\nThe mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago a literally in Ninety three and all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in wealth\nOh they did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses it up into I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative then\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nA there is there's a couple of different sides to that you know\nI have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student you had kids in Japan and there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned benefit\nSaw a bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kids said they thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that uh the raising children on fake empathy you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that\nThe noble the machine somehow or just\nYou know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about a human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought would that in some way how to numbing effect on people now the question can they\nFeel emotion or that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel wants a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nOr can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer feels that\nPain nobody believes that ... ... or ... now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nThey did really well you wouldn't know if a treat the pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions and even if they claimed that they did that could just be in a way of program running that\nKnow the the the program reasons that it\nCan achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt's it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nHappens in these machines my ...\nBack to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they started doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like hell from two thousand once the sun\nRight I mean look if it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course\nYou know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just turn them all on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways\nA malevolent machine would want to um would be able to inflict harm the the the interesting and and so you kinda have to say what would that happen\nAnd it can happen in one or two scenarios either through Curtis programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr Kendall machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and her perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nPMS dot com that's green Brooke PMS dot com\nIt's hard to

I think anything that multiplies human ability is you know with ... with a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet and so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's pick it up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the program they're\nGoing to start and hey Jeffrey go ahead\nHey I've taught and the ... I Love your show jailers thank you ...\n... not once or twice I've got some ... and\nFire [laughter] and I and I tell you what played them back down and show\nYou know what I'm saying that don't say that but what what's wrong film\nI'm disabled I lowered that added faint fade jobs I mean the technology that taken out to the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs\nRight I mean\nLook at\nYou you can look at the unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work\nI'm almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring I'm\n... you know technology\nAlways empowers people to be able\nTo do more than there was this kind of like an infinite number of jobs\nYou you\nCan make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it you make something worth more of age and whatever value you were able to add that to wage and\nBecause technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough\nWhen it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of shake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of\nFacilitating that up because you know if you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live in the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we've we've got to be very mindful of that how we train people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but to turned against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive as bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nNow I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers are there are hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust the driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of a myth that a\nIs there is going to be a huge a shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know without kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up\nBecause everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there is no future in that because of self driving trucks so most knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're going to have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles and then when we get over the legislative hurdles they they still are only going to be able to do part\nStill don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze\nAnd we get over the legislative hurdles they they still were only going to be able to do part\nOf the hall I still don't want to see a driverless truck she put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\nWell I agree there's a long way for the technology to do it it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car it makes\nIt's a huge ... in in in ... Arizona driverless car till the woman\nMhm yeah couple of months that makes the news which you know thousands of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to look into\nThe least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable they're awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nNo I mean certainly put simply put\nIf they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say well it would be better if if we all woke up within you or your points tomorrow\nHey I says what study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's the collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something a bigger it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they caught somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience but come the data\nTo make somebody else's life better in the future and some no no the technology to say artificial intelligence is that it would be to say intelligence is somehow bad\nWe've got Joe in Long Island New York now Hi Joe go ahead\nFire and a couple of questions about what they had a corporate level you look at Eastman Kodak is competitive GM and Eastman Kodak really doesn't exist and and they were you know at that height maybe twelve years ago and uh you know that a lot of good research and uh\nThey didn't hold on a so sore the corporate level I think they they may have had to have made some missteps\nAnd then uh if you look at throngs I think uh there's an obvious\nPotential for chaos with them drones flying around and trying to walk down the block and as a drone flying at you or are they can be weaponized than and flowing into a ... a ballpark law game as on\nSo that's another thing and finally just working

didn't they didn't catch on right blockbuster on another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you\nWe're we're going to have to work that out and you know we went in search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs there's going to have the laws it's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because that's a very real working

may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except we're such orders would conflict with the first law\nThree a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what he's saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are\nAre are literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um\n[noise] you know if I'm going to do something dangerous potentially aren't myself 'cause the robot according to those laws intervene and stop me if I if I order a second dessert uh and I got a few extra pounds on me there's the robot say no you cannot the desert because that's going to hurt you I've got to save you got to protect\nExactly monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever\nIt exactly exactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots as no two people kind of agree on what moral

just going to pick you know Joe and make an used Joe's moral code for all the robots even\nChose moral code is like full of provide those and while you don't do that unless it's this but if they're all they're all of these if if and and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots have ethically and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nThis is a robot out there

one for those of you that aren't familiar with Los Angeles the four oh five\nMajor freeway is the ...\nDam of freeways um five hundred thousand people a day traveling the four or five just to give everybody a perspective a I take the four or five every day to work\nAnd this one particular morning\nUm I ... you know I I call people whether friends or work on on my way in which he like many I'm probably an hour in the car this particular morning nobody picked up the phone I called five people and no one picked up so I get on to the four or five and I'm Around at Sunset Boulevard\nUm my radio is everything is off I have my left hand on the steering wheel and I hear a voice as clear as you can hear mine right now that says put your other hand on the wheel\nIf your phone rings don't look at it in fact don't answer it and then there was a pause and then the voice said there's ... there's going to be an accident\nSo I have my hands ten and two looking around you know it's a four or five so you can't move lanes in rush hour\nShow bumper to bumper oh you were stuck\n[noise] although we we move if those who know the traffic flow you actually move once who um are going south on the four or five past sunset so I'm moving and then once I hit hit will share the two cars in my line in front of me quite\nSo I pump on my breaks to let the folks behind me know something's happened and then I slam on\nLine hoping you don't get smashed them\nWell right but see I was ... I I was ready so I was prepared to knowing that I needed to do that is\nThe situation is coming so um I you know I fortunately didn't hit anyone no one hit me and I checked to make sure everybody's okay get back to the car and I called my wife Suzanne and I tell her what happens and she said you were just so calm and I'm like yeah I Know I I was ready and she\nAsked who it was I said I don't know and she goes was Mona [noise] and I'm like no it wasn't known and just everybody knows the Mona is was one of our best friend that was killed in a car accident five months after my mother died of Alzheimer's so I was getting like the double\nDuty of grief and I said it was a man's voice\nShe was she was like oh you think it wasn't like I still don't know and she said call Patricia and see if she knows I'm Patricia I'm bank ends or owns the crystal matrix and Atwater village and she was a brilliant psych\nAnd she said call Patricia and see if she knows I'm Patricia I'm bank and a owns the crystal matrix and Atwater village and she was a brilliant psychic and gifted teacher she's incredible and sells really great crystals and it's done by the way many in Los Angeles is interested\nAnd so I call Patricia and\nAnd I tell her story and she goes oh my that sounds like that was your spirit guide because I've never heard such specificity she goes you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if you're willing to be open and less than they are there to help us and I said well it's a really good thing because I kind\nOf hurt that woman in the car in front of me and she has no\nBaby\nIt wasn't a woman in front of you their life that your guide with saving it was yours [laughter] that's right\nI went oh\nOkay [noise] does that change you well\nIt it in and the second it did so I go to work have a weird day [laughter] because I'm thinking you know what a crazy morning that ... that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives

and trust yourself\nWhen you take your picture ... mhm are you aiming at something or does it just\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it wasn't hadn't all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was that smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see\nTheir shapes either form it without the smoke they were not there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see ghosts but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWith amazing you know there was this Julie we're gonna take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is the ghosts

is interesting Julie where you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it was funny I um when I'm sitting at my publisher she was asking\nIt it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nShe goes oh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I sit isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nComes true it comes to [laughter]\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did when our time's yeah you know when we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to because some of the things I encountered um are are strange and some are scary and\nYou know I found at times um\nAnd and this is where the Claire ... really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel um if there is a ... a bad entity\nAn evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks to understand um and that is if you if you may find themselves\nWhere they have a ghost in their house or they feel like they've encountered something and they feel that fear and their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominant is like dominance like you you can get rid of most of them like that and that's what I found cause I started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma upgrade upbringing I was raised in ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer hadn't used for really long time um\nAnd worked for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter]\nProblem when you think we all are telling the truth while I was gonna say do you think everybody has the capability to you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to happen to\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nFrom the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different\nYou know perhaps I have you know so few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media a big way Mm you Google ... when you were experiencing this how come\n\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your kind of becomes your reality\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your kind of becomes your reality you want to see you want to know you're not the only one\nI think I was looking to see how common are uncommon\nSpecifically the photograph did you get answers\nUm I started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of ease my nerves and then and then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts\nAnd one of them is that movie the witch and did you do you have and see the which\nHave not seen you haven't seen\nThat there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film which trial and I'm\nJay van ... who is the kind of friend advise the producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day\nAnd there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess\nAnd he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer so they all start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking um because there was a there was\nA a like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he was like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod to find them you know\nAnd I'm like oh my gosh\nThat's been happening to me\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this to sort of happened to me and there was no instruction book you know I was able to identify were ghost were I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\n... ... ... ...\n... ...\nWell\nIt was just like the ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this well he could be medical it could be could be\nPeople have woken up and realized that he should leave because they can't lose ... syndrome then you realize you know you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the old ... ... basically paralyzed\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called\nThe ... man yes you know high ... I\nI I'm a a friend and her on Facebook and I read her book\nThree girls I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the house\nAbsolutely is and\nShe is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing um and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven um a friday\nAnd what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven um a friday right um\nHe had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on the hat man\nBecause it came to him that's right and\nNightmares right so what was\nInteresting with Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans crystal therapist so\nI grew up in the big when I started to yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George don't just take a few pictures that go send me go all the way [laughter] no longer\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened [noise]\nAnd I learned about this stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful rocket is not the prettiest rock and their personal kingdom but it's really a powerful and it's and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter [noise]\nUm it's been studied by the curious and also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians and those to like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it [noise] and um and I know is to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex and Alex but to send your night stand\nIf you're interested and want to find out more about the position for fly than go to the station's website and click on the career tab monotone media has an equal opportunity employer\nOr they can be made like real estate investing in this area is a great way to start making money yes there's risk but also the potential for high reward if you have time testing system supporting you and experience investors surrounding you this is than Meryl from any hit TV show flip this house come check out my free to our educational\nEvent and feel what it's like to join my team you all like the systems tools and techniques I've created that you can't get anywhere else these systems were created after over a thousand real estate transactions in the past fourteen years take a tour kick the tires you have absolutely nothing to lose invest just two hours in yourself and you're only more prepared than when you\nFirst walked in I made registering easy\nTo get to free tickets to the fans workshop touched your five digits a code to sixty seven thousand seating is extremely limited so texture five digits a code to sixty seven thousand text in the next ten minutes and you'll also reserve of free copy of fans money for needles guide just texture ZIP Code to sixty seven thousand\nNews from the PGA network studios of buildings we have\nA big zone across the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend area is in that storm surge warning area Florida's\nGovernor Rick Scott urging residents to either repair or get out of the way you cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out of an ... ordered every family must be prepared every family remember we can rebuild your house but we can rebuild your life take this seriously and keep your families say\nLike all expected to make landfall late Wednesday as a category ... hurricane as many as ten people have been hurting in Los Angeles\nAfter what police say was a stampede during a meet and greet a shoe store for the rapper Flora eight people were taken to the hospital Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh takes a seat on the high court's bench today after his ceremonial swearing in at the White House by\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh will begin the less visible part of his job hearing arguments that the Supreme Court or photographs and video a rare most cases It's MORNING do with criminal statutes in sentencing for repeat offenders tomorrow justices will hear arguments in a question about federal detention and immigration cases\nBut Kavanaugh is influenced could also direct what future cases to court takes up on a hot button social issues like abortion and religious freedom blocks of Jared help her little hike or will be asked to intervene and Thursday scheduled execution in Tennessee the attorney for ... claiming the state's three drug protocol could cause pain and suffering\nThe state Supreme Court rejected that arguments on Monday [noise]\nThis was Fox News [noise]\nDocumentary specials and more of your favorite for our time is going to be our\nNation coming soon to be the personal\n...
