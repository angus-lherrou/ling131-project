was a shooting clinic\nBy Steph Curry fifty one points eleven made three pointers or he did it all in three quarters of working out Glenn contours back\nBack Brian hey Brian let me ask you something you ever seen anything like that in your entire life but we just witness here\nI Would say no but I feel like I've seen him shoot like that before\nThat was insane you know it's like he could put up more points in the in a in a short in a shorter period of time than anyone in the league it's crazy\nAnd you know I I and I really mean what I say is that when he revolutionized the game he did because he you know he takes bad shots and make some and then they become defined as not bad shots and there's nothing you can do about it and we've already\nIt's bad shots and makes them and then they become defined as not bad shots and there's nothing you can do about it\nAnd we've already seen sort of the first\nUh sort of moment of truth with what you're talking about in terms of him revolutionizing the game because you look at what tray young stewing right in where he shoots the ball from and the way he shoots thirty voters off the drivel I mean that that Steph Curry stuff\nAnd if you watch you basketball if you watch the youth basketball they're all doing it now these kids it's crazy\nThat you've got to make shots if you're not making them you're not going to play so it doesn't matter but still it's a it's it's bizarre that is bizarre or we come back we'll take your calls at seven seven nine three six nine three three three was this fall\nIn Golden State on a night were Steph Curry when both ballistic one forty four one twenty two last I'm going ... with me and this is the Budweiser post game show into WG a Washington Wizards radios that was\n\nCircle rock and a greater support singer certainly\n[noise]\n\nSo there was one second chance three for Steph Curry and then just moments later he got another one\nCory now said shutting Dell right elbow why\n\nForty three with a nice number but at that point he was the lead been away from his career high it's the score was starting to get out of hand distorted got the sense that might be done for the night after the third quarter and he started to try and rates to his career high fifty four points before speaker could take\nAround my rent out from\n[noise]\nHe hit that one from the left time out past smart about uh thirty two border and he decided thirty to beep night\nBut how about I take one from thirty by all\nRoute [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nHe had the oracle arena crowd in a brain the\nOne of the last forty one time they will see him in oracle arena of course the warriors moving to San Francisco next Stephen Curry would finish the third quarter\nFifty one point a lead in three pointers made\nHe would be done after that and things wouldn't ever get closer really from that point on curry shooting barrage seemed to demoralized the wizards a bit they didn't have much fight left in him after that\nNot much to report on in the fourth quarter but one positive that did come in the fourth quarter Austin Rivers was really struggling with his shock coming into the game and through the first three quarters of the game in Chile had this one go down\nCenter and she loves the circle around she's a trillion rivers\nI go to Austin Rivers\nFind me very three\nOne the one on one of the storm\nAnd once you hit the first one he wouldn't ... to more after that took three straight three for Austin Rivers in the fourth quarter and while it doesn't make too much of a different tonight considering the wizard lose the game by twenty two points\nYou wonder if that's going to give him some confidence moving into friday in Sacramento if that can be the spark to finally get his scoring going we've seen him are able to get\nIf that's going to give him some confidence moving into friday in Sacramento if that can be the spark to finally get his scoring going we've seen him are able to get to the ram a little bit make a couple of plays he's been defending hard\nBut it's three point percentage was so good last year and it was one of the reasons why the wizards\nBrought him over to be sort of an extra shooter who could come off the bench make three guard lineups happen ties shooting has been validated that that's far\nSo if he can build on his performance in the fourth quarter that might be good to see other it's nice moments from the fourth quarter\nThomas Bryant got his first point says a wizard and rookie Troy Brown also got into the score sheet for the first time in his wizards career but it was when it was all said and done one forty four one twenty two was the final\nWarriors improves of four and one on this season while Washington drops to one and three are they [noise]\nLuckily you got that went in Portland Monday or else they would be staring down the barrel of an ... for a start and there would be an immense amount of pressure or going into the game friday night but as we look at some of the staff [noise]\nSix wizard scored in double figures led by Bradley bills twenty three of no ... Seventeen points on five of paying a murky Morris Fourteen points on six of ten shooting Jeff Greene also got ended up all figures in twenty eight minutes off the bench\nAnd I'm bored Golden State they're big three\nOf curry Duran and Thompson combined for a hundred of the hundred forty four points that the warriors would end up scoring warriors shot fifty eight percent from the field\nWizard shot forty five percent perhaps the biggest difference the wizards twelve or forty two from three for twenty eight percent\nOf all the warriors were Fifteen to thirty two for forty seven percent\nAnd that right there is your game recap [noise]\nOn the other side of this break we will continue with the Budweiser post game show well here what Scott Brooks thought about this one or we will also take a look at the out of town scoreboard warriors to beat the wizards one forty four one twenty two you're listening to the Budweiser post game show on the WG a Washington Wizards radio networks [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nJane I'm headed to ... the demonstrating how to make the river we want it for our lay out great I Want to see that two plus we'll need a bridge can do and why we're there we can check out this week's new games for game night anything else well shall we need to notice for his rocket and Tracy wants to build a fighter jet this happens every week\nCans everybody get your shoes on we're going around tales everyone enjoys a trip\nTo rail sales in central Virginia is hobby and gaming headquarters whether you like model railroading\nModel kits strategy games rockets or all of the above all else fails has something for everyone who make a trip to rail tells a part of your family time or come in and browse yourself when you just need a little need\nTime You're welcome to hang out with fellow hobbyist anytime pope and he was day through Saturday eleven to seven and Sunday new ...

I Am glad and uh it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with not sensational live\nI mean let's face it stand back and say betting Barney where specimens for something [laughter] yeah\nAnd they weren't treated but they certainly weren't going off and glory and claiming all kinds of not see things as being part of their interaction with the aliens are\nAnd you know [noise] I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on [noise]\nOn my ... and I I was very impressed uh and I was impressed by something else uh and the media in that case a K in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh\nUh you know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and money into town and told me where they were staying and which is very unusual you know an eye contact with them we had dinner together\nOr just the three of us and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't dealt with stuff like this I mean\nIt isn't that crazy story aliens you grab the couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you\nWell yeah I mean you know you've done it pretty early on was early yeah and the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right\nNo till I was very\nOh it was early yeah in the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right\nNo till I was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the ... conferences I didn't get too many meetings with Barney 'cause he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that\nAre very he's gone on and of course I work very closely but he's nice Kathleen Martin we've done three books together mhm and uh\nThat's been a pleasure to a if not often you find it can write with people ah haven't co written books ... with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYeah you you you too clicked and she's great in in the field and you follow due to a career she's super permission\nYou don't gamble when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and then I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed him over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in a you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I says so what do you think Dr ... they're\nTelling you the truth or not what do you think he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately told the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\n... ... we have to remember that the doctor Simon ran a facility for three thousand shell shocked\nWar veteran yes called the ...\nWere way before anybody would get involved and stuff like\nThat yeah and he had learned to use it as as a means of bringing guys had terrible experiences you know your buddy said on off next in battle a that's traumatic but at least\nAnd so he learn how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands and you\nKnow I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business but he surely thought that these people are not in line that's right they're\nNot looking for attention cetera et cetera I was impressed with him and uh I was in prison betting Barney two and a foreign aid ideal is forties and uh unfortunately but they they they were\nThey had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early sixties\nWas not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak I resisted ... a reporter with the story out much to their surprise and relief or they were treated fine\nAnd they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a look I lecture to Nineteen countries\nIt's given me a pretty good handle on one of the people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know visitors from someplace else and I found I just haven't had\nThanks officers aliens or you know visitors from someplace else and I found I just haven't had bad reactions you\nKnow and if anything it's getting even stronger I think let's take some calls for instance let's go to John in Virginia Beach east of the Rockies go ahead John you're on which dancing Friedman", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "25"}
