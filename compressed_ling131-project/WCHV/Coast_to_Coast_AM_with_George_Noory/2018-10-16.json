from people who said oh my God\nMy watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this says is years later we re ran part of that program on our weekend shows\nAnd I started getting emails from people\nAfter that scene George my watches are working my clock is working and I'm going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we had re run

big T. V. shows\nThese has actually worked started my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first big television show and\nThey ended me for two band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera and I said everybody at home\nGoing get your spoons and get broken watches\nIt looked into the camera and I said everybody at home going get your spoons\nAnd get broken watches I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen because everyone wanted to experience this phenomena first of all no one believed that spoons and folks are going to bend and watches we've come alive\nBut they nevertheless they brought this to the broad broken launches in pocket watches and [noise]\nI mean there was massive and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work and lo and behold ...

... invited me to her class\nAnd of course I did my my act and I left\nWhen I didn't know George is that she secretly recorded me while and I went back to New York two weeks later she took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four and Seventy five and Seventy six\nAnd she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils students with broken watches and lo and behold there watches started taking from that video now she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix\nBroken watches the Los Angeles\nAnd I said no way what are you talking about I mean New York I didn't even know that you you're doing these experiments and that plenty don't to me that it's basically I may trigger army capital east I mean in may ... to\nThe power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and blocks all around the world and people just we're just our gas it was amazing I first met retailer back in

got region formation and had him on my local show when I was the night talk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay well it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus\n[noise] okay where it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old\nI Lived in Cyprus and you could see up we left because my parents divorced\nMy mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the cypress yes and he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms and most signed the Israeli intelligence services they found out that we're from Israel\nSo they basically turned the hotel into ... and into a more safe house so\nSpies would come into the hotel they would check on their you know teachers geology ... but they were really Mossad agents that were\nFrom Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about Cypriots fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only left and I didn't know English and I so people\nBlown up I I I mean ...\nOut of Mormons I've seen everything ah curfews bombs exploding a so being at that age it really changes your life\nSo I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing ... the British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks\nBut why all this was going on I was ah I befriended their Mossad agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the consulate in the Israeli conflict any out\nThere reason I told you the stories because I already was excited about you know the the life for fear of spy yeah and I love movies so to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel\nI met time go to ... who was the\nPrime minister right [noise] and she introduced\nMe to Ari Sharon you know these are all your gender rose in that they aren't sure and introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break in let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly room in the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with three Keller the paranormal as The Mentalist next on coast to coast\n[noise]\n\nAnd George ... back with you on coast to coast along with the ... next hour get your watches and you're broken blocks together will do an experiment with Marie\nAnd see if we can get those working for you but there are a you're talking about how you were with really the the leaders of Israel golden my year our real Sharon who ended up being the prime minister and then went into a coma and less for longer than I ever thought he would but they they they recruited you basically didn't they\nYes they introduce me to the head of Mossad uh they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but\nThey basically didn't have the technology\nTo test my abilities and they picked up the phone and the coldest CIA and he was a CIA scientists quote kitten green who took the coal basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of gather\nProduced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it\nUm my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me they wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how to let the occurred\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left ... straight to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition half\nA and then I started working for the CIA\nIt went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition tests\nUh and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concern me and it was amazing when you know the press to hold of this story any twin worldwide\nAnd die in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parody cages are there there was experiments where kids green held\nA book in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phones then and no Twitter and Instagram\nAnd I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also worked on that page um and the word architectural and I wrote the same word in Palo Alto in California so [noise]\nYeah that's the answer that I worked very hard to read these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were a United States touring and uh you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson showing were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he he you know kind of um ... into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was

I Know it sounds so far out and freaky and science fiction but I did exactly that I ... mind to sign sign sign and they sign they knew the nuclear arms reduction treaty of course I Can't claim that I eat eat only happened because of me\nThere are other elements involved but I was definitely an instigator I was in motivator and I use these powers to convince the Russians to go ahead and signed a treaty\nAbout a year ago President Trump released some JFK documents and then later on released some more there's still a lot that's still a bench press already but sure enough we uh we read that worry Geller was asked to look at the JFK files\nYes what happened is why I was I'm working for some CIA operators and my handler is in Mexico city\nIt was very kind of genius how they got me into Mexico I was introduced to the president of Mexico or look ... and his wife\nOr his wife was kind of fell in love with these powers and you know she loves the paranormal in the supernatural [noise]

goes out where there were there are American spies going in um people who betrayed the country and so forth and one of my tasks walls to find out Neal Harvey all vote actually visited that that embassy or consulate\nThere was some controversy about that because there was a picture of what we're supposed to be Lee Harvey Oswald coming outside of the embassy but a lot of people were you said that's not him but so go ahead\nYeah well that was my task was to tell them whether that was him or not\nBut there there were more more in much deep for things in Mexico that I did for the CIA [noise] it was amazing I I actually loved it by the way I never got paid for this I did it out of ideological or reasons\nAnd I love these showbiz nascent cloak and dagger are there I was on Johnny Carson in

some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project negatives spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely you know why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from across in and finish to to possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances\nWithin exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting in the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces\nOr one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou said that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was the one hand George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you were going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they did have a few good song they really did\nSome beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys Jordan\nAnd I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no\nAnd he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the interest that and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys\nAnd I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material it was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFrom linear time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dolan is that's right who played Sherk is boy on television\nRight that's right and and still touring still touring\nYeah who is still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter] and do you know the name ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know\nHe he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas ... groups of people ... ... each each trying to prove that positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's\nRyan and he is totally convincing these convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Ryan pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subjects in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were downcast when they were fatigue their scores death\nAnd it was inevitable ... bike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah he's not going to happen for you\nNot going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to me that surely identify your most heartfelt\nThe Shirley identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we're going to tell you how you can get a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast day I'm dot com it's amazing how well how did you\nDecide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research why don't I write about the methods sweater and I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean we don't live under many laws enforces\nBut if one can understand how much that means\nYour thoughts are more powerful than anything you've\nBeen brought up to realize\nIs it the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts change the brain your sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if thought\nThe brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method\nIt works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel dejected one of the things that I write about in the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces\nThe law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't\nMean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances\nThis online banks for closing on us they even have documents that I signed for a home equity loan only I didn't what a

miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nEr which says we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does ESP fit into this mess you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments than to ESP ... telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in ESP lab is that the mind\nPossesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five census\nOnce we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical that the mind has an existence outside the sense a body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalfway and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. riding the grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important\nYour thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nThen you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must want it with everything in you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because\nI Would contend that what you want over time you're going to get\nDo people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging people might urging people and this is something lister is can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stand sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants\nThink about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it be intimate\nAnd see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secret that story or a different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term law the traction because I don't believe we live under one mental\nBack for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term law the traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws enforces the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous segment so I think it's a mistake to think that\nOur minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is\nYou may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we used to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in ... D of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge\nThat for the next thirty days you are going to dedicate your mind to everything that is productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse\nYou don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days of the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will neutralize a list of people who have written in yes we're on the prayer list for whatever they need a new job in a\nSelection something people even right in and said please\nYes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need a willing to reach a new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that in any way wonderful how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed than facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that I'm prescribing they can't direct their minds in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance [noise] that's one prayer comes in that's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch from our own psyche so again I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from Greek and they can't do the things I'm saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the ... club\nDan former Wal Mart

these things every day because what happens is we become extremely forgetful this is where we doubt that our thoughts affect reality because we have a thought or we have an extraordinary occurrence and then we forget about it\nSo the challenge to each one of us and every ... listener becomes when something like this happens to you how do you get up every day and remember it and not slip back into complaining or taking life for granted that's the challenge that we face in life\nLet's go to the keys in Rochester New York Yankees go ahead\nI yes I have several questions for Mr ... class envy usually is not good but there are these persistent studies that show that home your family is now where you're born ... really do determine where you end up in life\n[laughter] I see this all the time I get highly myself for heart fast city resident and\nEven though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this would lead me to my second question ah people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I Want to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in skull Harry New York where ...\n... I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives\nYou know one\nThere was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out at this death trap but these those people Mr Horwitz of the\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and\nTill class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but that they were like many people in society\nThey they were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there ... there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say\nThis has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like sheep to say it they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me and the city and seen my fellow city residents many of them good enough but not getting ahead in that in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves\nI'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep so many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just\nSpeak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this stop and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we had the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside the limo ...\nThere are indications that the car was basically used my term coming apart that the uh people were saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk on the car was being coming very noisy and\nAnd literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably\nHigher middle class of jobs where they should have had the smart the know how justice say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know a 'cause you've heard me before me teeth oh that driver would have pulled over no if fans who are being\nYou know I I Would have wanted to be in that limo with you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know what there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep the singing of course I I read the same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces of never including love accident including accidents birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality\nRegardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think\nIs dangerous it's vitally vitally important that everybody act with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is that\nThe mind is one vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone\nThat there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can ...\nThis is socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having minds that control cognitive and motor function\nAnd that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that the mind as extra physical properties\nAnd it doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force that occurs or comes into her life but it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always in everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to Thomas a lawyer in California now Hi Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview with your gal or I'm very grateful thank you and met shovel comment and question I'd like to share a miracle short you know I regularly lesson to an audio program in which you match\nMarried her nap audio program as National Guards Oh yes Lawrence all year round\nAnd job I Hope you write about ... God or in your upcoming book miracle club I Do have a whole chapter on him called mirror man it's one of the longest chapters in the book actually oh fantastic fantastic I just love\nNarrow National Guard and he has this whole idea that\nYour imagination has your reality yes really the outside of events but it's your own human imagination yes creates your reality yes\nYes devil is truly my hero and for any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two and as the caller was describing metal taught that your imagination is God\nAnd that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor for your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing and right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you\nAs you are ultimately rooted in God and that everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here and now is really your emotive thoughts and mental pictures pushed out into the world so that was nobles teaching that your imagination\nIs God he was very simple he was very practical and I write about him and the miracle club he has been the greatest\nSource of inspiration in my life\nMeant show would you give us your Web sites and folks and how they can get those membership card into the miracle club again\nOh sure thing website is Mitch Horowitz dot com if you just throw my name into Google\nOr whatever search engine you'll find it if you go to the website my email is there it's my really email I answer everybody who writes to me or you can ask me for the miracle club card you can ask me for the thirty day a mental challenge instruction sheet I also pray every day it's three pm eastern time if you have a prayer request I'm happy to do it for you\nAnd you get into a routine don't you oh yeah I really I hear from ... all the time\nAnd I respond to every one of them and I love your listeners because I find that there ... there are people who experiment with things who actually try things and and and I I I Love hearing from every one\nOf them you say you can lose weight\nI find that their doors there are people who experiment with things who actually try things and and and I I I Love hearing from every one of them\nYou say you can lose weight you can get stronger you could do all kinds of things he's using the power of the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I get the details in America is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on the hotel maid\nShe found that if she explained to hotel maid the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic Lee healthy and then studied the mates for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing she found the group that had been educated about the aerobic benefits to their jobs\nActually lost weight they didn't do anything differently than we are just that you needed to realize that their jobs or anaerobic Lee aerobic Lee healthy they lost weight and their blood pressure were lowered just because they had been educated about that back ten the mind alone help you lose weight answers apparently yes\nV.

and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work Mitch in what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that I Would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road tested and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination I write about this and the final chapter of the miracle club\nThat once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once\nIf you can actually enter into a relaxed meditative state and picture yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to your younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe want to dispense a piece of advice it can change your life right here and now in the presence but be careful because sometimes things that we experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson\nSo reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene imagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point\nFrom when you can tell whether things are different I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we are race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons from times\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy\nUnimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity now here's this\nAnd productive but don't think of it is just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch powders or how\nDoes it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question\nThe fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select\nThings I think as in the particle lab\nEverything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience\nIt as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so our actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon he's the experience\nThat we entered into because everything is happening at once\nAnd we go in and out of these things\nThe way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle steak\nSelect very carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Barry in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line he barely go ahead\nHello there jarred what a pleasure in these are yeah Schmich\nChar which a lot of it is to hear you on the air I Love it when you're old coast to coast\nYou're such a a bay and the person during a thrill the same way thank you so much appreciate it

that is something to thank you very much for sharing that story that is something called the mirror technique which club Bristol wrote about and I think George is familiar with young if you look in a mirror look yourself squarely in the eye and a mirror and state in a positive\nManner what you want to occur it seems to have an effective magnifying your psyche glug Bristol called it the mirror effect\nIt's so simple it's too simple not to try just as a friend was describing go to him or looking at him or you can do it right now and just a surge in an emotionally persuasive way\nThis is going to happen this is going to unfold deposit it'd be productive there's\nSomething about gazing at yourself in the mirror that seems to magnify the effects of the psyche just like the caller was describing\nWe now go to any in Alabama my low any\nThinking Hitler each sure the morning\nAt trying to think or southern off they go off\nI don't know what go ahead you here and they are\nSure the
