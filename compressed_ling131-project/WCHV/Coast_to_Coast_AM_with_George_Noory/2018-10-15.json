giving\nThe great pyramid is forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly at true north south east and west\nAnd it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly\nAnd yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read Hi Howard lipsticks nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what\nYou've really done well for yourself but but what got you here\nYeah this is a you know this is one of those things you look back and it's just incredible sometimes you just you know you you are you take a moment and use you ask yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those ads linked to night on the program and you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the rope a new was the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat\nDown and started discussing uh the the snakes and ... at least that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt starts with a wry and they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of humor and then we looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way and\nAnd so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the or the book the that they just had coauthored origins of the things which is amazing ... by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things\nRobert section he's developing a you know something that he knows when the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically lots of things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a schemes then it said it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember at the statue I remembered the lioness on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nThe um I think it was causing the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it\nThis uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about why\nIs it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the well the gays applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything [laughter] he loved to go didn't tell their story and not only that but taxes in an accounting in seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nThat that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with this things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you're on ... when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fool key offs was alive and if you walk into that to them there's actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of ...\nAnd next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they call that cover his grade and coup was driven was called to Hawaii of Google\nAnd so this was a brief that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too\nThe plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou aren't the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other ... about how it was built a new bill through the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all\nThe way to auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp\nUp to the park to low and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of ah um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream fill up between the positive things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small\nReference to ... but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it does definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the image towards the ... the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... ... what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name kudos to Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the large says very under critically when ... came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen and you would say\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast damn are murals to be church or ... minute saved his id and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMuch more ... than I guess we're going to be in [noise] [noise]\nDo cardio mobile today for just Ninety nine dollars [noise] the cardio dot com and take A R D I hate dot com take unlimited Katie's morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio Mobil much peace of mind in your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars for your time today ... hardy a dot com K.

we were talking about the inventory style and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and end the dreams della\nA top most the forum says mentions and and illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks well there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take but is there a second thinks\nIt's a great question on so that was that was Robert ... um\nIt that's that's my take is there a second springs\nAnd it's a great question I'm Out of it so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things are as the celestial springs in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on an unmistakable so so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground it was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things are on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under this sounds\nA let's say west of a conference pyramid it's possible the\n... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this things but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the image ... is saying that he was just to repair guy right and then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course Egypt colleges are most pauses do not accept the inventory ... as a historical document and ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is\nAuthentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but\nJust to be fair to both sides um so it to your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text and\nOn in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to me means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of the Stella a is a is a strip of tax where you know the pyramid building as mentioned and they are the verb that that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the powers talks about to a store and being ... or ... or a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nCould have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I to be that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about\nIt and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also wanted to use a plateau right could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes yes there is a there\nIs a reference to a head Knutson\nUm hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subjects so who is going to the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pyramid for her at the southern most of the three ah off the three a queen permits that are on on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid and\nUm but in the human tourists there like it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to spell out because they're saying there is no evidence they knew it was a princess ... again ... and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think the poop shows that she was a prince says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of coup who he's got a you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well um but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the house or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man with the same pair right and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even\nYou know more complex yeah they're not and there don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been um you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality\nIt's a few casing stones that were left in place and I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of their smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to\nUh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old getting them\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nIt fell off the roof of my car I owe it fell off my grocery

I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nL O ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back great Cathy\nYou like that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm a day or I always love hearing is that all that it may have more do you place great for me they gave the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two crashes and then I've got a great little short green quick about their armored Tyler just at the end\nOf the first question they asked her is credited with Jimmy ... or the deciphering\nAnd learning to read hieroglyphics\nAs huh is credited with Jimmy ... or the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAll Howard graphics around go back recap in Egypt in that area of the world the same hieroglyphics that are found and the pyramids of Mexico central and South America\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are irregardless lipic inscriptions in Beckley ... is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking are the ... that are written all the ... and Egypt on a pair of the civil war and go back like that the other to same Ira graphics that are found on the pyramid is in Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different higher there a different era glitz and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are\nYou are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipstick inscriptions and go back a heavy in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name right but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at go back in Tempe but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they in the same I don't know there is an H on the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks and ... are are they related I don't know right there are some astrological signs in go back leads happy are they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we're in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but uh go back ... happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first Senate does the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I call it the army's age on the bells and it's one of the looks like but does that age that ages repeat it\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question that they ask and go back to the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned to me there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\n... will do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared and I'll mention it later on in the show thank you bury\nNo problem thanks for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call on all of them yeah let's let's go to this is a let's go to\nLet's go to my dad in New York my ad Europe next\nMorning can come in and great guinea and non ...

[noise] I like now\nIt's MORNING gentlemen great tail guinea and now new\nI guess I have a two part question I'd like to know if he um\nHas looked at any of that pie raise such as the pirates of any age and I and I'm also I I think that might be the one that deals with the U.S founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular one the\nSecond part and I'll listen over there and is whether he and and and Rob it and and shock ... had can say that some of the um the African and African American scholars who studied the net net net too at\nA wicked said name on the the language which is is is still out of that that ... that to\nA phrase itself deals with this sacred and whether he looked at people who call themselves a huge cabinet for instead of the gift shop and you know before they\nDid Greeks gay men and consider themselves at the cabinet colleges Kevin is when we got word from for chemistry and also um the what you call and I think\nWas that was the word that think we Scott came up with and to me [noise] what they define with the riddle is not what it is and the African American dollars that I'm thinking of they call it a little odd that horizon so they use that turns her real O's saw\nOh sad if you follow him a question and I'll listen over the air\nThank you man Bree okay three questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the next and knowledge here because they don't play around on the\nFirst question um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but the the one that I have looked up more specifically regarding medical\nIs the ... century\nActually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's next to colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this was in the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long uh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him more tips time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nBarred damage and which was the name of Egypt of course a degree that's\nAn excellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it you just shouldn't language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egypt and culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two huge a\nA king scorpion and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt a ... probably from Bhutto and brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with a ...\nNorthern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto Bhutto as a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably Mesopotamia with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a picture all so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you know what the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds it the Greeks adapting ah the etymology a chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes the issue I think she mentioned is thanks so we we think that was making before uh before Africa game I think I was I think it was the lioness and their name was ... and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am\nIt's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long\nOr guessing I my new save Saturday his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\n\nIf you're considering going back to school ask is also following questions do you need the flexibility to take classes and your schedule you have college credits to transfer\nDo you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for ...\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty highly ranked at great programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree as he went on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled class the one line accepts north transfer credits for information ... lived for three five five wind surfing\nLearned for yourself fly off the air is ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line tax live two three five five one five and that's how the e two three five five wind sapping\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess tonight and Manu save Saturday more talking about the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week\nAnd how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or my new right there and this question just came in before we get to a a page out three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes\nUm\nI haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience\nAnd and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nAnd this is one of those questions where the math of the of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to this\nCoincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is Evan Wright five ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinate Thad Allen just discovered\nA fall right next to them I stop off game you know which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd it is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with those Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and ... is revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt is absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month okay so now and the and the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's on page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression and the way he isn't trip and one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allow that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then then let's go and so you know so there was some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detected by me on again\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\n'em and are you going up words every body of one of seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different size in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way\nIn a different thickness on these roads right right right yeah\nAnd and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just use this illustration does as an older list ration I'm so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basic the establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words there\nIs a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space it designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project there which\nI did help them find this ... this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being place um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and it was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to do on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when a cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of particle called them you on his created enemy on is\nA negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier or didn't electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it show and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stolen so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the the chambers that you are proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifacts will and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real\nBanks recognize when people are taking an active role and try to protect their account information and they're and they're going to give you the benefit of the doubt\nMended says go

this is coast to coast am [noise]\nYes so there is a there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Robert de ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the most crucial and um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under the ... and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was the ...\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things and looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are here to our space is under this beings\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um\nMight be something in it that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies entered really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have lots of marketing or drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from\nWhere we think the chamber is so\nIt didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know when you first\nIt didn't really use a good map to guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were ... so what we want to do is you know just like a you know it's like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non advances buddy and really find mapped the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course that worked try a small probe into that space and see what the\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumor has been going around for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh put this to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever might be inside a you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that just came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that at this thinks may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie and

that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this but it you know this one way that you can explain everything has a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in cosmic alone is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line Rob Rob in Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for a minute\nOr absolute on her speech your daughters really critically a notion struck me when you talk to road structured space lose a look and make it quick couple of quick jumps and laundered\nLooking at the idea of a Greek skinny architecture Mohler tremendous ... super big jump gardening term papers a farming old knowledge building big ... structures\nAre who's to say I mean you really could do you remember I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid\nBut could they not maybe just when you say structured spaces be actually filled with Ford's Rajiv on rocks and everything you know arches inside big cavities like temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through and that's exactly the conclusions are that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention shop here who do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is these on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year business show it but I think the theory isn't that I think it's possible that the scan was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know he reviewed to paper or but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably spaces up there\nAnd um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nPyramid of cool pool it's it's\nIt's hot spaces inside researches in the sixties went to offer his pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid biting off his mid ... only chamber\nWell let me jump in I'm going to take a break right there but this is something we need to

just found like that and could that possibly be the original thought of the garden envy\nThat that is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new guard newbie in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's written books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the the Mahoney if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the ah the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think uh there's\nFor specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and ah lived in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in the pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears indices archaeological evidence at well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's it David wall is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay says I heard that surgeon tools for found indeed ... pyramid that doctors use now true or false\nUm I\nWell what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish scale 'em wet on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was\nWhat on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a Wayne

I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ...\nI think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers so I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo inherently up all this uh the uh the hopeless was known for the center of the worship of nine major gods as kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy ... and there are with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if what if that were ever to be found\nUm but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm oh I think I'm with John P o die think this it's still on the table that there may have been spaces there that\nHelp of workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already got inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it indoors or less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the discipline but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not there were there are parts of think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders so yeah tourism has been down and they\nThat's I think he's a plateau where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love

the rear of the things\nThis ... I see the south side yes um there is\nA ... or so Robert scan did show\nBoth sides if I remember correctly a there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes um and ah\nBut I mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when the when\nA antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry hall to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think\nI think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back you know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think that there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looked down on the ground and he's he's what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs the wood picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he lives in up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole\nA guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the rear flanked by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw it with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about uh the ... the I think that there is there's there are spaces under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind pouch that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean ... and his nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a a tunnel a that started up in the northwest corner where the bird uh two was but and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes for these birds that were there\nAnd it it it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long that stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high wash who are denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the ... or from the uh the oath Irish shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt poses are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the oath Irish half it's possible that the upper two layers are they taking them but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure\nAnd it may could act um but yeah without a probing 'em and nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces\nUm but yeah until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of ... cost way uh and then that's\nThe two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the

four pillars around and it was fascinating um you know this ah some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the ... so and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the ... you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to through that or ... or Cyrus shop we think it's possible that is referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to\nA no official called um ... cop or something like that I Can't remember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nDo we think we know\nOf ... before we had to the break ... ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the ... there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite\nPlace to look would be a besides the you know ah besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things it could be in front of this thing's temple and then the other thing is we I predict inane mentors the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course it's that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the ... of course everything facing west in facing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau there is an awful lot a that is ... ... the uh the pyramid complex facing\nA west in northwest there's a lot there and uh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the early Eighteen hundreds\nBut there is a construction then is represented in those ... original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some place\nIs that ended in those of original survey maps that really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some place in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends and the oval office place but\nUm but there's nothing going on sixteen because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I don't know what it's for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the
