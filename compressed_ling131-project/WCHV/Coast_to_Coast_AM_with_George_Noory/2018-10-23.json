[laughter] ... what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who do that we went to the moon jumping for joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean let let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building\nAnd you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon\nTo go there I pass a bill passed on that they had in the ... and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you probably sell me what you buy the swamp lend you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land then went this is\nWell you know would be is also doing what he's doing ... sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kinda and not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and ... built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects\nAnd and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us\nUh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the moon I was hoping brain and spine would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh the they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nIs that night uh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time ah because shore we\nStarted the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and and I got to tell you this thing that must have done and creating these reusable rockets and and and and\nAnd he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a\nKilogram traumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to\nUm what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone or it was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless\nUh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott blue origin but we now have three small launch companies a firefly a vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the us space\nIndustry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at fusion parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem with it\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crackpot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours [noise] next on coast to coast\nAnd welcome back with Robert Zubrin from the bar society as we talk about space we'll take calls with Robert next door Robert de you know ... don't you what kind of a ...\nUm [noise] what can I say he's\nAn unusual guy um do you watch him\nUh yeah although we can be a difficult at times uh I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is um [noise]\nUh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is is okay on the one side he well he is very driven it's very hard working uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh [noise]\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great he wants eternal gory for doing great so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish ... he he um and he certainly um\nNot above using people uh [noise]\nHe he um and he certainly um I'm not above using people are\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you know a ... you know there is\nUm ... you know a self\nAssigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go back but\nIt's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the we had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nWhen he gives in that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature or that as a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about\nBut you know um\nHow would you go to Jeff measles Robert Well Jeff measles as much calmer\nI'm much more laid back um I don't know\nThese cells I met him once uh\nUh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect the at\nA mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard being shows the model if his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space sexist the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race\nYou know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money\nWith his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money okay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that\nI'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time or the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more noted cost much less\nUh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European book all these experiments or ex\nDiscoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is it's finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the groundwater\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes fat is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like a a million cubic kilometers of\nPure ice covered by just a few feet of dust\nKnows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available\nWashington DC you know that ... the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um\nI think there's there's ... there there's two different versions of it\nOne is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France she won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did\nWell for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past\nIs just a hit it Jeff from and also Fox

plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\nWell\nI'm I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is\nBecause a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now\nOr it has some value\nAnd uh and and and exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nAnd um once our space a capabilities advanced a bit more ah that will become a possible thing to do\nWas go to John in Seattle, Washington\nAnd um once our space a capabilities advance a bit more ah that will become a possible thing to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington and welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your guest's name Robert\nRobert Robert are great questions of people who are um oh probably take 'em off here [noise] they're sort of speculative the first is um\nYou know anything about ... years ago that the ... the anti gravity back in the sixties and ...\n... you know anything about possible reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity and certainly you know anything about electrical record ... from the\nUh let me that those three questions they've got one more Robert one more okay one more\nYear the third one is um we're gonna be advisable to design a space station like a memorial type thing to to um oh human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that second question artificial gravity\nWhich goes along with your last question of a spinning space craft yeah we do know how to creating artificial gravity you spin the spacecraft\nCrates and cheer physical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view or a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't live um\nIn zero gravity lawn belongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and in in in ... and ... you know and\nMoving it around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition no role there won't be able to do anything for you\nAnd then the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using a electrical electromagnetic forces to accelerate at ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay\nDriving around town but if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um\nYou know a week later you're going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because your car and drive\nOver water in this case but\nIn any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electrical pulse and then it does with chemical ocean if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would uh be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation dead\nOr the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and Mars has got much more resources to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the\nOf ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to green you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then\nGet on with it go to them don't come up with some other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nCan you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the ... the first time fifty years already wherever we're at the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody had told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree to ease the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead law\nBut I'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes a shoe or or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even\nOpen space as opposed to these ... planets\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have won away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship them to Mars what type of ... looking for\n[noise] uh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come tomorrow what type of person always looking for all right\nLet me take the questions one time or the first question it be hot and space if you're close to the sun\nUm if you are a far away from the sun it's called ... and if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why space it so why is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that uh but space itself\nDoesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit this break all ready to go by fast with you Robert ... with us we'll be back well uh let him finish up Joe's questions there and uh they're interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the moment I'm coast to coast am\nEight

Zubrin here from the Martian study Robert ... by the way are linked up it goes to stand up comic Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\nWell I'm well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are you might well want on a crew or it's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars\nUm and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would like to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor or you know or not you know a grouchy um and and and bitchy and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all in all for one\nActually you want to take tomorrow what's going on with the ... August conference you're working on\nA well we're having another conference or in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles I'm In ... he could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise]\nUm and ah I'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this\nFor cities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah I'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or ... you say the gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know ... there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November called insight\nAnd it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have\nUm a discoveries from ... um there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds\nBy them and you will prompt discover thousands what's done um\nCalled Tess um you know a little you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's\nA probably have ... people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu arching people there too so we can hear from them and maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to create small launches you know the we now have\nSmall satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites or to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm and I'm a I'm myself from involved design of a mission to go to the moon ground penetrating radar\nWith for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little launchers like this could really play a role\nI'm alright psychiatry more colds where you go to the first time caller Armand in a bill gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earth but on march\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to geo water I. N. G. L. dot com like international geo water international and the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet\nBut the water comes from them back ... below and whatever you got the ... the planet fractured that water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen auction can make its way to the surface them back in areas of the ... the structure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact\nThe largest volcano in the solar system is Olympus moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just ... digits there was a cold they're on top and that's what ... provides Scott city or lava flows to happen\nSo that's really what are the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations ... bars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think well I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on\nMars we found the lakes we found glaciers in this probably more to find so I think he's on there\nI it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the legs found glaciers in this probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either\nOrganisms flew here from noodle shop the media writes a slow off the planet or or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the game I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true or not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors or because Mars um\nWell a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could which either means one or two things\nThat life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that when you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit by meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um\nIf life could evolve quickly out of chemistry it would've on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that keen for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated they have this whole\nSure of DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information\nUm you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and\nUh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before you know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars gotten in interstellar space\nI just lost me how did you get interested in all this Robert\nSputnik that did it for you\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu\nAnd while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later ah I'm

defense against sickness and misery get inspired by visiting critical Health News dot com where you can purchase modular nutrition packs and see for yourself how good you can feel\nAs you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and\nSylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but\nThe physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there was a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was\nPeople who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found electricity and smells\nMore than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place or get ashes [laughter]\nSo he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences in the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number and what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on\nWhether it's ex federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio and the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAre and they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also sign saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people didn't realize how sensitive\nWhy is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand and realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things I mean do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I ... my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most\nYou know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively to that does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brenda\nMy a criticism of them because they always seem that they have to have some kind of ... leading tone or\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do the ... thirty minute or one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these uh episodes don't you\nYeah I think it I think it is it really does too because it implies that\nEither people are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know ... every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine no you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have a one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes too few ghost more than others but\nWhat about the ghost itself\nOr there's some does that come back more often than others because they have an ability to do that\nUm I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else\nSo I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really\nSense I mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station ... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver\nHe or she may be more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ...\n... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive person um they're going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes to encounter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however one location I'm picking up\nAnd I pick up on all this stuff you\nKnow I go from place to place to place throughout my day however one location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of goes the phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it so then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places\nSo then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon ... out of the other locations\nYou know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was you know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that\nYou know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients are variables that line up\nHabit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that\nI you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric a consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me early\nYeah it really is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV and you know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little knob on it then you click\nIn brought into signal better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed brand\n[laughter] I remember those two so\nDo you know or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question a lot though the the team of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happen to you it's amazing it's great\nUh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good the bad with a positive with that this was at that\nI think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's\nDemonic mhm demonic in team\nIs more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um\nYou know like a a scientific perspective\nSo usually whoever classify that as a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's where I usually when I meet Steven knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of things\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy it but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies is website on to the ... of course linked up at ... stadium dot com results show on Facebook\nAnd

the studies Brandon can you you you do you interviewed a number of people with some studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites would yeah\nSure sure ah so I have several real life accounts that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween is approaching I'll I'll I'll go with this one\nPerfect um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife it passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself as Halloween approached I was putting up decorations as the kids in the neighborhood usually a lot of trick or treating my\nWife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we had places ... plastic pumpkin at our window every Halloween\nI searched out for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom she smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished\nI began to weep uncontrollably rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my face as the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench\nIt must have fallen off the top shelf\nSo this this is a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting or ghosts interacting with us\nSo in this case you know the ghost during this goes the encounter the ghost had a conscious and she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings\nThey they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness um they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on that are on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction um is sort of a ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like um the ... in intelligence the interaction that giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nIs there a pecking order on the other side brand in in in your opinion on what's already I mean who sends the goes back to do what it does does it do it on its own or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness so you know who who we are as people are\nAre personality our memories are um everything that we are um are ...\nAfter we die you know what happens to that right or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just ceases to exist um and that's kind of mainstream science says view but\nWhen you look at things if consciousness survive death\n[noise] um and that's kind of\nMainstream science says view but\nWhen you look at things if consciousness survives death and it goes in and it continues to exist it's it could maybe really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like ... example with a husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past life\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a past loved ones and then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment is is really important uh Michael personally or who recently passed away if it was a neuropsychologist basically said\nAnd he did all the the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every\nEvery person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist in it um which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln civilian a kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that\nThen maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences happen\n[noise] what do you see the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of said\nJokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy I'm so ... you know what I usually tell people who ... skeptics\nOr things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and um you know you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments unmet floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who were genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience that's huge yeah you\nKnow and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or you're that or your unstable or elusive dating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is but listen I in my professional opinion a lot of these ghostly encounters are the the there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as opposed to skip the cousin open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right because you can just\nGolf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books and it's really easy to sort of said everything is\nEverything is not a ghost or everything is it goes it's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read that believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's\nAnd you also have to read that believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's\nFraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part is is a central when it comes to\nBeing involved and apparently I was sick for a pretty much a majority of my life\nWhat change do\nYou know I\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but\nI never had an experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong\nSo when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I won't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening and then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening\nAnd I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious show drag stuff\nI'm Harold ... life feels\n... Raman Moody's work\nYes exactly a near death experiences all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle matter and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible\nThen you know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year um I I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that ... E N E S P and the sigh phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this than these ghostly encounters could be possible as well\nAnd that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part a thing\nIndira dawn and us experts say don't swerved and don't lower your front end by breaking that if you think you're going to hit a deer safest option is just a hit it Jeff from and also Fox News\nDollar saber guy with another money saving ... dollars saber were opt to act was seatbelt car wash in Charlottesville for their plus wash package that includes hand wash vacuum clean windows\nTired shine interior wiped down at spray shine twenty dollar price tag you always have price fourteen fifty these court watchers are on sale right now right this second on line at the veil dollars saber dot com that see bill dollar saver dot com\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ...\nSeven five and am twelve sixteen\nGood morning I'm Brian down\nWith WC age the local news first your top story on Monday Eighteen year old ...

it's not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more

linking up to the environment and having an experience of some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent haunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those\nTypes of things are harder to explain in in sometimes that falls into an earth ... spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in the way um you\nKnow just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for that goes to come out and you\nKnow try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others and I've seen the film of the baby ... chicks being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother still wouldn't return to the wild the chicks noted key in\nOn a mother conned or are you mentioned the window we're who was searching for the pumpkin and his wife appeared and then goes gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three\nI Will rub my eyes in various ways all different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a occurred within me a ...\nHere before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a occurred with end me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not not close by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people speak so emotionally attached mentally like a husband who was white that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm yeah yeah it's it\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that ... you know I I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something and the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars uh there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five because we're matching frequencies\nSo with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience has happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it ... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life um so we're sort of imprinted um\nWith with with these archetypes and and with sort of\nAncestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar\nSort of\nVisions and stories and things like that\nSo I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture\nBut it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes there out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes your religion kind of change your views about these aberrations grossly donors\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes are using it basically changes our perception of an experience\nSo\nYou know you can have someone who's a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might perceive that\nAs more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel\nI'm a of of a sign from from God are assigned from a deceased person that they love um whereas a person who doesn't have that religious till two it might experience that as simply\nYou know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's everyone's past sort of influences how we perceive\nAny sort of ... paranormal phenomenon um and that's how we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in\nAny sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth found spirits everything as it already found spirit a so I think perception religion or they play a huge part how we perceive a ghostly counters impaired on the phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me and says careful what you wish for those types of\nFoods I guess [laughter] so I don't wish to be a part of an exercise but scientifically are with my fascination I'd love to sort of be part and sort of gained some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions jumps and you know how they can get this demon disappearing demonize the person's system and you know be gone in ... it's really weird and remarkable at the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it it's but my brain always goes to there's all there's so much misinformation and mismanagement of things like that and possibly fraud that I I'd have to be there to experience it for me to go okay yeah I Believe that\nLet's go to Shelley in North Dakota Hi Sally go ahead\nWell hi I'm a you know I mean I'm\n...\nI'm just gonna talk about a serious car wreck when apple at\nMy well my daughter question you know and she was out on the lake just having um last [noise] and uh she came home with a sunburn and uh my ... when I\nCame home early from a bike rally and he had paid or twenty dollars to mow\nThe lawn mhm and it's pretty big blonde and he said well she got her money\nYou know kind of sarcastic can and she just cry didn't I touched sun burn Bonnie nice to ... I Can't see she she just get it done it's gonna be okay\nAnd then I had to go to work\nAnd Pete\nHer stepfather laid down on the couch and [noise] [noise] well that's lasted sarver\nThen what happened she got into a car\nShe got into her car it was a corn do bar which she always felt like was the big car and then her boyfriend was there and he knew\nWho was on who are in the back of his pickup and ... who was driving a car smelling she was\nShe was driving car George\nAnd she didn't wear\nA shirt\nAnd so you know these two kids were like Eighteen Nineteen years old and they were kind of panic Tim\nThen let me ask you this is Shelley\nEighteen year old and they were kind of had a job\nWell then let me ask you this is Shelley are you getting visitations from her now\nGeorge\nAnd a lot of ... nobody there\nStrange phone number is no doubt there are you on caller i._d.\nRight right right do you think she's trying to communicate with you\nI Know I feel that I really feel like you\nMay be All right let's get bread than take on that when we come back and just a moment Brandon remembered the story and ah let's just get your reaction to that because I Do think loved ones\nDuring moments of tragedy like that do try to make an effort to come back and communicate that does happen we'll be back in the moment with spinal calls from coast to coast am\nWhile I'm not quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coined or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now just over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy don't own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin you've our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit block meant R. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\nAnd we'll get back to the coast to coast your story along with Brendan will sue law in his book of course called the ghost studies brand and we're going to go back to ... and just a moment here\nSally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that Brendan what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead which he encompasses a great ...\nLess a bunch of these um\nPhenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace message as well just recently came out as well which goes over this as well\nIt's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call ... electrical electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this and there was times anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events like she was talking about\nUm it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistent Caesar's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from it\nHappening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency is there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nDo you change the skeptics mind you\nI think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening\nOr it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point ghosts are measurable phenomenon and the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable at will which is essentially it's everything that the scientific method hates\n'em so these things are tough and and isn't that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imaginations I'm\nNot a cop out though to be just to say that\nI think it's an ... a cop out would be an easy answer to it\nSo that's the idea is if it's if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say well the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way so\nIt's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know which is pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures in the piece um but there's really no fall up after that\nUm and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really is and and this is kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you kind of it's about collecting data it's about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge and academia in with skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know of\nThree hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have um a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variables are um some similarities inconsistencies and then you've got measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue I'm with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people were just adamant believers there's\nThere's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom truck driving in Pennsylvania Tom going\nBy [noise] how are ya great thank you yeah I Want to talk\nTo you guys I'm a long time listener first time caller so bear with me a little bit short story\nA back in Nineteen Seventy four nights you can buy I was ten or eleven years old they continue your small house and upstate New York\nAnd I woke up and I don't know why but it was uh\nPaul Laos and upstate New York\nAnd I woke up the middle of the eye and I don't know why but there was a man standing there and he was a goes with the thing that she didn't even hear the Spanish Military uniform\nAnd I'll never forget it I close my eyes\nOpen it back up and look at me like the ... or slap myself up what times myself we weren't studying in school or anything like that I close my eyes that really are\nOpen them up and he was right in my face and then I close my eyes again and he was standing back\nAgainst the wall street dirty look if you can just smiled but he was funny and I just walk through the wall whoa\nDid the uniform looked like it might have been from the Eighteen hundreds or something like that some\nLike the early Nineteen hundreds the rump both on the shoulders and uh I don't know who might not a spy but I don't know that they had you know\nHe had a moustache she was a male\nWas there any kind of battle in that area a long time ago\nI think so in upstate New York you know farming community in an old farmhouse what the heck is the guy I don't know it's just I've never had another breeze with anything in my whole life again before now\nAll right let's bring the expert in Brandon what's a Spanish so you're from the Eighteen hundreds doing their\n... this is this is a\nFascinating story and and these are the stories are really give me the most excited about this phenomenon
