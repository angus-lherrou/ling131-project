George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the\nGW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago about the the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views known who were the victims or\nThe Salem\nWitch trials and how historians had been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim I mean it it was fascinating go back if you're a member of caused insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America demand from the train\nDiscovering America's most elusive serial killer oh this ...\nThis is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we are not competing again\nHe extended the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one\nThe Dodgers will get another shot at a coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to do but but let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah uh it it\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of robots on the robot that is created\nIn the very first version of I robot which was in the Nineteen thirties\nSits down and reach Frankenstein and then has a better understanding\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast they abducted come to a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base\nMaybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know the it would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old Roswell in a very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings\nWho joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nGet evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as the travel and then you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this is that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans\nWere for Halloween what do you do if if if Ross was kind\nOf Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\nAnd most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the coordinates uh the greatest family ah\nThe coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on the U.S a spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven at Eighteen get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a valve heart good feeling as getting lost in the ... like\nYou're a crack in Nineteen forty seven other people go out here bottom or break state park ah which again has and history at the bottom last and and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to our camp and things like that but again I'm\nMore more of the stars and the telescopes can people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and\nAh you know it's just that that theory if there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them to actually around Halloween and during the year after the vote in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell\nI'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to a new position will be teaching it\nIsrael I'm moving coming up in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose rule on my way to a new position will be teaching to Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Ross ... we we we mapped\nIt out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to dip into Roswell before we came back up again\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their door call and the research a part of the crack I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the speakers\nAnd do you believe in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're both for over twenty plus years and he will take you to\nBe exact location of the timing\nOf the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the Bogle families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still kind of\nIn in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people\nCheck out and um you know search for the trees and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know ...\nI I ... there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know with there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nThe sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have to amazing alien that we'd decorate for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but\nUm these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers the month his name and Bob and mark salient and uh you know\nPeople really come here searching for the truth and we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you ... ...\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up ... every year in ...\nFor the Roswell festival for the for the crash ... festival that happens in the summer the U.S ...\nUm so our population has doubled in size where we're at town about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we get a little over two hundred and thirty thousand\nVisitors that come into the UFO museum entering\nOn average per year for your family you're a little over two hundred and thirty out and vigor\nHoney then you're from entering and are\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you ... and if I'm if I'm driving through time I get a chance they'll say hello okay\nYes prepare yeah\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism or public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico\nA season with the which Jay W Oscar the subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you you're very funny book you resist great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic side on a serious subject because\n... and we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has\nAn even more extraordinary placed in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah because I have I write a they're a city of about forty thousand usually 'em and eat on Halloween just how I felt about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month it's within the quarter million though the massive amount of people for that small that it I have a within the borders\nAre well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked Halloween shaved heads to the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views on Salem and I you know I learned a lot then\nToo but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that the\n... the ... there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before the Salem, Massachusetts\nSo yeah I always try to tell people that said I wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one in the ... and all the trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first first with trout America you'll it a victim wasn't Connecticut ...\nIn Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims but of course yeah injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed ...\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even in in um north of developed\nCountries are still winter meaning people being executed for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all the things on the planet that have had this problem which is\nIt was just incredible feeling said I never felt before such as ... around my hot when I had the auditor and two and a half months later something amazing happened which will taste while I had actually if I'm ... I'm almost staggering about baseball staging a chipper contracted to bomb soft\nI could kind of way that might result started coming for ... it kinda barbaric ... hot excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully owner Richard astro here we're talking about the power waking up your immune system which says he'll this gentleman's hard perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C.\nA. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n[noise]\nSo uh Jay W locker author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those debts that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage shirt England\nA long ago turned its ... which is incident which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and to her too\nLincoln shirt England\nLong ago turned its ...\nWhich is incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five in Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late\nFifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain or whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just\nSome of them and not even all that happened in America but its Salem\nThat sticks out and so why why do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that had gone with the book and I think it's a combination of probably ... two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem has which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but it was about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a ... you know it's a moniker of shame right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but\n... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about\nChicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't ... don't go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy but it didn't say on itself was basically just for the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials right actual family members and the you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around and say on the actual\nThe actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver was at the time to fail village for sale itself doesn't really have a ...\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but with trials I mean the actual which is that live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... than it was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a determined which has like a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess it and this is important and I this is it is great distinction you can't help\nBut feel do it sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims a murder that they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry kind of build up around them no\nMm [noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly or something the Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know\nProbably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath there for board so to speak and part of it that's less connected to the tragedy with more just around you know the identity and all these other kind of\nBeing just become and and twenty anything\nYou want to go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts ...\n[noise] well go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts [noise]\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] he is\nSo they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really has bled over into longer than that so if you want to experience Salem\nDon't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other\nTime of the year you want to visit founder Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds it's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um I didn't talk again a hundred thousand people packed into small down time of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff\nSo you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans or none Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nBut ... ... ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get to seem ... did you get it Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nOr oh definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that they'll cut their families to them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right booze or the part of it but this is within the party [noise]\nOkay so you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch genders former Salem Village ... are there are a lot of haunted houses or were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting idea of innocent victims you have monsters 'cause it'll be a fair trial didn't get the ball which is in the story involves\nDemons and him since ... and ghost everything we're in the trial for the big monster mash seeing all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of dead people over\nThe centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um the ghost tours their spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there you go there so oh yeah all the time out I guess there are two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience so\nMy interest that that is more in the story of themselves you know until the day I haven't experienced my interest is more than the stories of and in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's the what's the best what's the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\nSalem witch trials that you captured while you've been there\nUm well one of the uh one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims happened and fail so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual story of ants that then I can\nReverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape or on the jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know ... kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kind of some kind of feed into that kinda cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\n... but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious wizard attempt to for him to do like to see on or something while he was ...\n... no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a kind of many of our apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know a scape\nAs a PR move for his next big advance so he wasn't down there do in order to say on busing but who has been doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike Joe ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how do they get along with this idea of the the celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into the\nTime my Children's Medical school bills I Want to go

here's the [noise]\nThought crossed my mind today on whether or not it would be appropriate to not do this show tonight on the book demand from the train discovering most to America's most elusive serial killer that there's a direct comparison to the shooting\nThis morning at the tree of life synagogue in\nPittsburgh but just rather maybe this is it like to talk about something else but then I decided that\nThe book is too good and the story isn't really directly related to that type of shooting that happened today and I just decided instead to ah to give you a thought that I wanted to pass along with all sincerity\nI I I just want to make it clear\nThat real life murder is not a parlor game\nWe speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe witches of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking tonight the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies but unforgiving\nIt's hell of a thing killed them and\nTake away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\nUh with the world very group but he moved out like I didn't go\nOh well I'm gay and and I will tell you though it did present a small problem\nRegarding our interview tonight\nBecause I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't beyond with ... so I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the both socks made it into the series I I packed\nThe book in my boxes\nThat are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to state I understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the two\nOf them on ...\nSo I'm moving to Manhattan men will be will be like almost neighbors and ...\nYeah my wife grew up in Manhattan I Know very well and I go oh totally cool so it's so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go\nLike uh the book is the head of data overnight me a book that I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax that I Do not want to miss with this true story of the the uh the America's most ...\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax than I Do not want to miss with this true story of the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James ...\nOf our daughter and my daughter read daughter or my daughter she's a she worked with me on a book\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't ... book and say that but I worked in\nA while it probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely cracked this case is very much to your credit\nSo I I Want to start if I can\nWith the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game less good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\nYeah I Would add to capitalize on it I Would have been to torture people want to we have to be going well over here are ...\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last the last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right ...\nOh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the bar Straggler along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime Mm Mm I Would I did um ...\n... uh uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took her in the box and stronger case and publish some theories about ... ...\n... may be right or wrong or no\n[laughter] well I Love that I mean I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in as well but the managing the train is a story it is it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once uh and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said ...\nIs is there any story too old to be told ... ... or ... when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not ...\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is\nShe said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it\nBut also it's true for all the time that there will be of somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening\nAround the country nobody is connecting them yet but in in one at least in one case in\nA ... a ... a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ended up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nOr are they are right there there are two ...\nWhile they're there for people who were extra lovely executed for crimes that may have been committed by the men are trained to them I Would go so far to say are\nFairly certain of the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed nonetheless the or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh uh but there are there were also in nine people nine black people\nWho were murdered by a Lynch mob ... who are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by ...\nBlack people who were murdered by a Lynch mob ... who are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by a man from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last but we are pretty sure that with him was Nineteen quell although there was a ... ... there was an interesting crime ten years later that has his ear marked but we can't say that it's ...\n... I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index of the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house um and\nThe ... the mayor ...\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nOf was murdered along with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because she was kind of into the sort of thing\nWhere I get it and and the the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found um but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the ...\nThe it is possible where you have a we assumed we did not find\nEvery crime that he committed we just we found those ...\n... uh which there were enough signature ...\nA ... second segment or ...\nUh characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that their ... to him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my hand scratching because I'm writing down\nWhen I heard about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe\nFrom the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason for a ... you know during this period ...\nWell what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and Buckeye right there's a hundred percent that bucket that his crimes were ...\nI Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and a ten percent bucket right and I'm white total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood that I'm\nThat are ...\nIt was our our criminal ...\nAnd the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and ... that actually include the two people who were murderer were executed by the state ...\nI'm ... for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were\nWho were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent um\nAs opposed to murders for which he would be responsible ... polluting the executions as murders because they were innocent or do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims ... because I tried All right so he gets through a typical\nAs you as you see the pattern developing in the late\nUh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's ...\n... ... this is a long ... this could be a long after I'm not a long winded person could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nOr a family is murder most often our family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemy ... they live usually in a small town too small to have a waste department\n[noise] they live near the intersection of two railroad track to be I'm a ... a very often bodies are moved their killed with an AK\n... is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they act as a band and at the end of the crime the handlers washed her finger prime the house is locked up tight all the windows are\nThis morning but just because there's a lot of doubles and running around these days including ... getting a big win to take a ...\nA show or the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities\nBetween the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we have the heartbreak at the bottom and the lawyers graduate or after they because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to\nFind a martyr my diet and everything but I can get a little bit but yeah there for the murder\nBut that doesn't like thirty four of them aren't there or something I\nSaw the I got the ... the ah the crime normally occurred on Sunday nights they usually Kurt on the weekend up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was barking or one of the primary understood was logging\nThe doors are doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they are ... ... ... there's all that are clear idea graphic pattern and the murders if want occurred just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland\n... a ... that that would be a a link between them the a ... ...\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would um he ... take our lap from inside the house turn the way way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light to\nTake the chairman a off the lamp and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed the murder ... another thing is that he would uh ... you'll put pull the blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you had with an AK ... are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from\nA flying back and hitting hitting him if he was ordering someone or the or the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior ...\nUh yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late\nNineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent when we're in this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new right that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin and it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side\nOf Chicago so very likely could have could have followed ...\nAnother thing I've got mentioned there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether his first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not and not a planned event probably\nThat occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather [laughter]\nAnd the vet probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee it's real cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about America's\nMost elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for them to be around\nIt yeah it hit a probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew\nI Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder and American history or the first or something a\nMurderer is by its nature done in secret or the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is that going on in secret beer because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed\nAnd I'm a ... you\nGet a lot of different people who claimed to be ... ... the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that a disgusting titled than the this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because ... the reality is we just kept\nDocument all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah and it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without ... much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using run away some of the things that that helped him to elude capture for so long but the demand from the train\nIs as long as he's called any we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime is a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them too close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon furiously but\nThen there's a couple of good football game against distracting dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody knew the president does him for us to just assume that there was some national awareness\nOf the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out about killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight and nine ten eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time it Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were in a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInformation of this type have little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve and a national wire services were\n... were organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation or so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nA ... in October of Nineteen alive and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew him immediately that this is Pam and this is the latest crime ... in this\n... ... series that's been going on a ... for the first ... more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even aware and logically they should have been even though\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when a logically they should have that even though you you look at the tribes and there's a case in\nVirginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart or the or a ... and\n... and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you and the crimes are extremely similar hand but there is no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year you would think\nThat people would connect the dots but they didn't\nThey are the first crime was ... was hog on the shoulders of a man how little it was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire and it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the inefficiency of the jurisdiction of sharing of police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative\nBodies of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time ...\n... that's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time and I'm ... I thought I was probably knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how\nA backward and ineffective our judicial system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nA remedy the investigative\nProcess war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture they ah they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town you know before the crime was discovered there was\nNo no way really to\n... to connect it to him and he knew that if you committed a crime and the big city in their place we're going to be all over it but if you committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but by the even when they did they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the the exactly\nAnd this was a demon I'll even throw in another piece even in prosecuting some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen\nForties I'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science I'm yet and I I wrote about this little bit in

body of a little girl in the ... from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the the little girl was usually found in a\nAnd an attitude suggesting that she had been\nA a\nShe had been outrage after death the I'm a\n... in any case the crime was not\nThere was a a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solve\nA two years later a con man named Jay and Walker some came to Alaska\nAnd realized that he could\nSustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a\n... and he did that by using a a very prominent local citizen Frank ... of financing the crime\nThere isn't any chance the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had an any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones a divided pulled us go in a horrible and unprecedented way\nThe city fought over whether or not Jones did it or didn't do it\nFor several years uh and became\nA cave badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line\nThey wouldn't go to they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them that this battle lasted in Alaska or even though\nA focus on was eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it\nPersisted in the city I Would I Would say for two things that that they protest to the present day\nYou know you mentioned the piece about the the person in whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nEven that creates a pattern for all too often how some crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated yet at the same time it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working\nThe crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody reading a letter confessing or simply knowing somebody that\nBut it was it and went to almost literally like ball in their lab which again comes back to the ... the power of storytelling\nAnd how he just keeping me telling a story to beginning middle and end all these events it doesn't matter how will the story is is it ... it will get people to listen again into\nBy telling a story to beginning middle and end of these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage about what had happened\nAnd so you know a static police report won't necessarily\nYou know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right and and and the debts but also keeps tend to the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of\nSensationalism but it does it makes it shouldn't make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened\nAnd had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been any had there been would have had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town there afterwards\nThe um ah well there was I don't know that there was\nThat kind of a kind of I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them\nUm for many years of Alaska\nAuthority that I Would say that still true today that he'd be the chamber of commerce tribe hyped and below us go wish the village was known for something else\nRight by the er at Barry there is a house where the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism\nOr it's the it's a shows up on her a normal TV shows\nAnd people have to take tours of the house the um uh but\nIf you drive around the less ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now there'll be a science thing where the doctors house has but that but uh where the\nWhat the list goes knowing for is not mentioned anywhere the um uh that's not an appropriate I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate\nMemorial on the uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly\nPoor people mostly people without a without one and the more family was very well why are they are and the community\nUh bought well on them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime war I kind of memorial to them but I don't think there was any physical memorial to them\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers in Russia where there is an effort to try to just enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace and that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons it's usually prominent citizens than enjoy that kind of it's down is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than national trends crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining houses the uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people are that area's\nStill remember it still they they could tell ya oh\nThat's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places many places where these\n\nJames the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter ritual McCarthy genes and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it just said that she lives with her husband nut you and so so I got the wrong\nUm but you should be very proud of the work do you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different bucket you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's\nOthers that might be likely that he did but you could prove that um or ones that are very unlikely but the the shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as\nBut you couldn't prove that um or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders ... they were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the the murder of a an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't ... wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe is let's let's let's go down this past\n... of of the process that you used to try to actually narrowed down to a name to a person I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example\nAnd including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world that shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in\n... wherever and so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder so it just it it's a it but if you have to have to START I mean it it's a quite a needle in a haystack but it's it's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing the search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that name could even be found in a given the scarcity of information about\nYou know people are public registries during that period\nOf ... intervention that Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read\nProbably twenty bucks dying jak the river was this guy or whatever it was that guy or jak they are and I and my other book is popular crime ... I made fun of the people who wrote those books I'm In the uh uh because I don't\nKnow I don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um I never\nReally expected that we would find it convincing argument about who this who was doing the same I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says that she did expect to find them but I didn't see a ...\nA vote when we walk the crime backward a there is a crime and Massachusetts in Nineteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it you know with him the um uh and that was because I had told her that\nThis guy wouldn't make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nNumerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the uh uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would ...\nThat you would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few thing\nYeah at least ... did you want me to give me the name or not it doesn't\nMatter you know we will listen to go through the coincidence or go through the the similar\nI mentioned just a few things at least is that you did you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally matter newly will go through the college students or go through the the similarities first\nWell the first crimes that were sort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously\nBy the same man and the the ... the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy that crime a month ago down south for the uh uh that criminal had size six feet or the um there's another crime in\nMaine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals I Wish there were a pair of boots France that were central to the trial or again size six feet is a very uh the the show we\nWe know that this is a small math well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet not speculation he did\nWe know that it was believed that he was small\nBecause I'm the or a ...\nAnd in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely graze the ceiling\nIf a person of normal sized person to a if a person a large man could not swinging an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five but for the uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you can see clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right hand that's a pretty easy thing to see it was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap but he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him\nFirst stories about him specifically say that he was an experience log or the uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA pre ... girl or a that was there in the first crime\nIn the first cry he always killed the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl or that's what he did in first crime\nThe he always used the blunt side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp type back but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts in this British crime blood side of the acts\nAnd as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the\n... the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that\nThis isn't him a\nSilly you started to look for science for\nIt point for you to think that\nThis isn't him\nSo then she started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile Nick are feeling I tinder in longer ax murderer\nOr how did you begin to narrow in name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he\nIt was obviously ... when it first crime is obvious who had committed it because he was living with a family with that the comic thing that cereal murders first crime he often ... kills people to home and he is directly connected and ...\nCan be tie so we kill the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and that was so they were looking for ... it's just that all of these other facts about the ...\n... about the criminal\nHappened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is ah the demand on the ...\nThe ... the name that he was using their with Paul Miller\nThe weather that we could actually he wouldn't even drumming immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not\nUm is speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was ... I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published\nFound a the the ships record in which he entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety ... are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm\nOn a ... he was he walked with a sailors gay he you know he he was bowl like ...\nAnd walks either side will be a A N the uh ...\nEvery prefer to go home pay my Children's Medical school bills I Want to go carts where I ...

an Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing\nTo lead stopped but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next coast to coast am this is Ian but [noise]\nOn my ... are you working mongering oh did he worked as a matter but but then there are some of the I think he did at the accidents that he used word they lumbering type of acts as\nA ... a ... mostly\nA like an act that was found in would pile ...\nAlmost all of the house I see the murders were a ...\nA more\nHouses burn would\nSometimes coal everybody either water coal use an ax\nTo split the wood or break up the cold right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWas she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nFingerprint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that's the one he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten in Nineteen than it was very common\nFor people to have an AK ... or wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah dogs\nAre is why I connect to the story I grew up\nIn a small town in the Nineteen fifties fifties Nineteen sixties that we have an accent what bottle outside our house\nAnd I I chopped a lot of with with them or to a burning out\nYeah my dad tells a similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lot of woods jumping but for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating\nThe first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nLike a fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on posed this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guests\nVillage V. she noticed any ... any parallels between holds a vision you wrote about and that says that the murderer always\nHas a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically berries and acts and his wife's head right that's what he describes it and and one of the week Tom he he's not going to be caught so\nKnow he he had walked with the cat up into the wall and uh you know we tried to get brought them into the basement and said look how solid the wall was but he always collected given ... away\nThe bight away while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a a story and Harris newspaper in Eighteen forty six or which is apparently the original story from which the cast of ... among the autos is based\nOn the uh the poll also of course was it was a avid reader of crime stories of as I'm sure you know be a ... anyway the answer is no ... absolutely was not\nTrying to get caught in fact he many many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police\nAnd sometimes they want you to know who did it but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out\nYou're basically of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there you wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene fleeing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed\nFor that the uh so no he was he was very nice to have a quite unusual extent you don't have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there I think for a guy who didn't have any money to the to the show some discipline um thank you mentioned the scooter marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Murray\nI guess in in um well I was calling because I I was kinda curious the first of all how you got you're talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were in fact again I'm not going to happen after the civil war in our family and they have in mind right however many that grandfather that was he was killed when an act\nAnd then second to his wife and abs and did that but I ended up being a brother in law that was convicted and um\nHe lives right now and I feel like I guess they have that skill workers would be blamed for back anyway and so we were in that came out and then\nMy brother was murdered a year again and then his son is in jail for telling the guy about two years ago by now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering and you may you mentioned earlier about if a person\nThere's been a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering you ... you mentioned earlier about a person\nYou know if it didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um\nHe seemed to be here well so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person if you um\nYou know where they're from but I'm just wondering if maybe the had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he seems to have normal here and when and\nWhere did you send it was essential to perfect for to be a first time this is what you're saying there\nAre certainly feel for your emerged story about go through your brother's meet the\n... and uh I Wish there was a bigger to help that would be helpful to your ... are are there really isn't I mean I I think as I say the Americans we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the role of the first crime\nThe uh but I it's not something you could we reconsider\nRitual and I were to sit out so in other series of crimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it with just the way the crime set up for where the story set up a broke for\n'em again to Syria was re let's go to my ... in New York for a Bill James on goes to go see 'em\nYes good morning gentlemen and when a delight to a a C. E. on your ah your back in the saddle massive\nWe're a good luck\nWith that well I'm looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment and I'll listen I'm over the uh well it's not to add New York it's it's over at\nThe end Jeanette [laughter] the first part is now we have is that she would already faces at at hand\nOr people at the FBI who were considered profile as so I'd like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of my my flesh this guy out much further\nUm also I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in terms of somebody at the innocents that got caught up including the black people who um wound up but\nNot even going to trial but getting Lynch and the last part is a\nYou mentioned about the state and the police at this time at the turn at the century and I didn't\n... I'm a ... ah I recently read a book by I'm\nNo good and they see as it's called how to Iran which became why this is on the Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had to I was looking for fugitive black folks but they off he displayed\nBeen as basically\nCompeting gangs as\nBasically street gangs with volunteer fire departments that had competing spite sin and demonstrations and unlike in common that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as a that formed in the police and I'll listen over over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions ... with the fire house\nWell let me and I'll hang up over the Internet banking sound like a\nNightmare for your buck intelligent questions yeah I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and\nPretty civil war because they uh [noise] uh I wrote about them in the book popular crime or they were in a it was a woman that gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers who was murdered in a\nNew York and I want to say in\nEighteen forty five or they're about a poll oh fictionalized says that the murder of Murray road Jay but the actual woman named Mary Rogers the a and the\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime they it really is an odd thing that they were the fire houses that were really just a just a ... a\nHouse with his family has a pretty unruly people uh and they they were kind of terrorizing the city I though yeah I I did a that's an odd story that I\nYou can start in the same path overnight you're seven minutes away from changing everything you thought you knew about trading and investing including paycheck truth dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\n[noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James\nGive us a minute here's we wrap up the last question um we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and and I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to ... to watch the movie streets in New York right to Scorsese movie the\nThere's a lot of them in the street in there and it's kinda cool ... but she left it to the question about what it at the end of modern police were FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI I haven't asked them do that because that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the up a John Douglas in modern a well known profile or has spoken and written about Alaska\nOr one of his observations was that ah the um\nWell he had several observations about the ... the\nCrime that lined up with what we\nBelieve for other reasons one was that the murder of had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it on a chart of how organized as this burger this guy is unbelievably organized or the or and and also he he uh\nHe said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is it for us to really couldn't have done it\nA because his mind is very disorganized but also because he was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something there's something\nThere but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked her profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got my ... of the book\nIs about innocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories in a murder in Maine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and that's that was accused of the crime ...\nIt was just a a he was a a a knock around me was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian\nWho uh who uh you know cut borderline homeless drank quite a bit he was accused of the crime and was in prison for Twenty years or before a\nIt became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually went to work trying to free him and they're free and the governor of Maine eventually a graphic added a full pardon to him on a on based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy bad happened after he spent Twenty years\nIn jail there are a lot of stories like that in the in the book it's quite it's a terrible side effects of what happened I think that the New York police are\nAre not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized\nA lot of good New York police are\nAre not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to now but by relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places didn't have a place to park\nThey are they are they had like a city Marshall and I was there the or not and not really\nThe the uh not really that are connected to my book\nYou know turn up um but it just to ... in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within the government is the where everybody was buying for jobs even if it meant getting in fights to keep them\nUm and end up in by the way I\nThink the profile or would you endorse what you've done I think you know I don't think you'd be very proud of the way in which the ... I Hope so it's a measure to say no really I mean I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights and there but this is the first time caller David is in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James days\nHow am\nI going to say I'm I'm Glad to hear you back on and close to call\nA stinky yeah thank you I'm\nI have a couple of comments a\nBirth Mr Jang\nYou're a large and I think in you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented Samer master for baseball\nSo I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm Glad you feel free to bring it up in in law had him for that\nBut yeah I have a I I think it needs to be lauded for that I didn't use out of their visor users are paid by the Boston Red Sox now but he basically and back to the table matched her or his entire life and I and what is China than about ... as far\nAs I think you're kind of lifted the barter why why\nI'll forgive him for that because I Love you know\nWhat's the broader point you think I'm missing\nI think you're missing you know that you're talking to alleging\nWell if a bill if I had been if I happen to ... appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my I'm up all that there could\nBe I British director saying that the game it's awfully nice of you the or have you ever been to Oregon the Mac McCain but uh I ... and working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge that and a project you can comment\nOn ... and then I understand why you wouldn't want to make an actor too but I just think that needs to be sad that he has a lives and our bags\nAnd he's playing baseball more enjoyable to me\nThroughout my whole life than your average ... ... you know what I'm saying though\nBut anyway the the reason I call in or do you think of the time of year my you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter\nThan boxing ring you are and and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the boredom or the ax murder and if there's any connection to them to\nBe a ... it's a fair question the question we get a law that is a it could be\nConnected to the New Orleans ... murders and and the answer that wasn't easy no they're absolutely the knock connected to the New Orleans murder the uh but that movie boarding cases not as easy to\nIn fact murders and and the answer that wasn't easy no they're absolutely the knock connected to New Orleans act murder the uh but that Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place however it's quite a bit different than our murders ... committed with a heavy act the ... in the middle of the night of the board and murders committed with really or by hand the hatchet hand held a hatch in the middle of the day\nAnd and they do not have really any of the\nRight on have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all but I Can't I couldn't say that\nIt had all connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying\nWith the uh uh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska so that's an odd connection ...\nUh and uh you know I think that Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and you need these speaks to the idea of going into a ...
