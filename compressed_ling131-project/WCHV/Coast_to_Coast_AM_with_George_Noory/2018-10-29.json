the view which is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be\nMulti connected if you like into connected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big for type creatures on in the same location and timeframe a site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point last in West Virginia or in the

... 'cause I'm not entirely sure they are\nCreatures or animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of saying a big foot vanishing in a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle entail with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got Wolfman going man ... uh we're ... we're cat ... a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nOr is it possible there all the same thing\nA lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities um or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different [laughter]\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full\nMoon has changed into a wet well from a regular person you know that\nSort of all the the Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seem to have the ability to walk on to limbs unfold limbs um\nI've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never got to reports of someone you know literally shape shift the liking you no matter how can we have over in London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I did receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dog men type creatures I said is intriguing it very often these ancient burial ... I'm Native American land um some of the their the mysterious mounds in Wisconsin and so on um\nSo I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one a werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah this was um at a a British a bicycle royal Airforce help to break and ah I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\nA ... an American guy but it's working I'm overseas are EFL can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of bases which had\nI'm an American presence there she was a hike to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ... and\nWould have sort of kind of looked like a big for type ... was it not\nJust the the face was very different to how you're describing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big for about a with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should create a story like metal fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess as a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so where\nAre you got a lot of stories in this book instances where people report these huge dogs I mean right out of town to the ... you make that ... that comparison in your book ... as well as these gigantic cats\nAnd the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal\nScape from the zoo or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside and some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the dog\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal that's you know clearly is not well in England or the okay we have what are known to find some black dogs now\nI'm ... ... who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel back to the ... he actually face his novel on a pre existing legit\nBut Cohn adore who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the ... he actually base his novel on a pre existing legend I'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k.\nUm that typically I'm much log much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes\nAnd then a lot of the old legends and traditions if you would just say one of these um find some black\nDogs they would either made that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die um and the and light the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um\nCrossroads graveyards I'm vice it like that in moderation is I've got several reports of people saying to find some black\nDogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like the okay she's going back centuries\nThe dog was that one second and then what literally gone the next second you know just vanished into nothing um and again it's hard to determine what based things all you know\nThe cliche not normal dogs I mean are they the spirits of dogs but once lived um I guess the only downside with that is that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life um\nShut and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there\nWell now you're right and the fact they become known as a bases I Am big cats and I guess every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the ... now\nThe occasional sort of ask guy\nHas got to pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where\nI'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats robbing around the a K which simply\nDefy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland needs hundreds every year\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be in charge colonies of these creatures roaming around about is if they offer flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about is the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature that this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween ACDC hell's bells we'll be right back\nIt seems every fit in each brother comes through you know at various times and this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody it's saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure\nSort of literally flying or a soaring would\nBe a better term to use over the woods or at a high speed um\nYou know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of point classrooms in the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect than there were\nThere were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press and one of the name and spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it but it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this by too weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light that dog mine and uh the find some black dogs and also a large black cats as well do\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services at a windshield of all places in Sunnyvale, California\nOh yeah that that's a really crazy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story I gave them to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like\nThis is a story I gave them to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with well I can only call like a man in black and not demanding black has that been\nPortrayed by Will Smith and tell me late Jones in the movies but the rail many black much weight that I sort of very pile and skiing a and don't and look entirely humans I sort of almost ...\n... and ... like\nI Know a lot of paranormal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies that some sacred agents you know of a sacred agency\nBut Terry told me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend on this creeping mounting black ... came towards them shot down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm\nBasically the the future of the the rest of her life and it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking guts or somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was you know how big was the sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating always this old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\n... didn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of folk after that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really for garbage or last ditch and I think\nYou know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm gonna come true you know I mean you could understand how we would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the ... men stories of at least the movie version of one man is that this creature up years ... different forms the different people at different times but as a harbinger of doomed come than it predates a bad things that are about to happen\nIs that sort of how you'd think it plays out in the ... men so I think the point pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt that um you know when you look at them off my story that it sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people that don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI wear papal started seeing this\nCreature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud and um but whatever that I was seeing people with clear that they were saying something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the sightings were that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity\nUm the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like a pro child money in black and also a lot of other amyloid they unconscious and also reports of women and black turning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on of the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter\nOf the muffin flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called the ... was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a poet license on one side of the Ohio River in Ohio is on the other\nSo it actually was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a port pleasant someone side of the Ohio River and Ohio is on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal on various research is um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the law firm on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have that was really sort of two

disasters and an by law\nAnd that's still very much ... if I took upon you know to this day but I'm also an English equivalent of it known as the our mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings into a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John Diamond Suze looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race or any investigation they all my stories\nAbout things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just stop it started doing the research that he realized from his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into if any quite literally\nI've actually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting his claws ain't team\nWe enter a resurgence of interest in marked man in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way\nWhether it is wishful thinking on the part of the people who follow this sort of stop and wish it would happen or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange\nPreacher waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just seen in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania\nUm there was sudden spots and outbreaks of big for its activity um some of these like bumps the stories you know the the ... and then suddenly those you know a two week period\nWe get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of um angle they feel like you see sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be you know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that\nThat way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interested in ... from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison

living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nAnd I felt somehow that

I have the theory of society preoccupied George King was closely watched 'em by the British a police force because I'm George King ... society we're very much\nUm by the British a police force because I'm\nGeorge King Lear the area society but very much I'm On the nuclear weapons I'm so falls were opened on them so in other words you actually have files opened on the contract to ease but predominantly because they had this political slant\nA in many of their claims but at the important thing is at the end of the day what it boils down to the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on papal who climbed close encounters um with non human entities\nAre you in a report in the book\nThat's coming out first of\nNovember top secret alien abduction piles you report something that I had read before it's about a very famous case a ...\n... the the this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female ... and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance to all different levels until that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can even call it a conventional\nUm aspect to the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where this young man named Antonio village ... claim to be taken onboard a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking\nUm alien woman and I'm I'm for all kinds of purpose if he was taken on board against these will show he was\nAbducted you know he wasn't Eileen abduction case\nI'm within you follow gee you know which are the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Antonio ... or you know it was a really\nWeird aspect of the phenomena and now there's this little uh known aspects of to the story or which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio ... a report that he put together for um\nA Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named ... um he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down on these started to feel weird to see the pain drugs somehow\nAnd he said he was taken aboard this craft which you described as being sort of long rectangular on\nI'm a I had like something on TALK like a dish that were spinning around very fast and he was making a Beijing noise and I\nFind that sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the the shy they the spinning disk on top of the road to the beach in noise says like the classics and you get with a helicopter now\nMine came forward um\nIn the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publicity is your name was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies and um he told a race a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um\nThe the abduction was a fabrication on the door but he really did evolve a helicopter but they targeted um Bayliss powers he was actually working in the field lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of average ... Lucia Jenike average so er which incapacitated in Tokyo on board the helicopter or on the the a woman was really bad and the power was played out\nChoking on board the helicopter on the the woman was rarely that and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was that sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was but the\nAgencies within governments\n... rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad I'm On the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like this the plan was to try and determine to want to extend the human mind to appeal to and you know in other words\nIf we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim but um\nBut they they the abduction if you like was played out and buy kind of just then sat back and wait to to say\nHow much of the story was taken and and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done in\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they see where it gets confusing if they're you know throughout January in Iowa and abductions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind\nCan be altered and they use the UFO angle is the most taste to try and you know um to see how it works on people it doesn't work so you know it gets really confusing when the cookie rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling you\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's so many abductees that I spoke with said that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually being\nVisited by military personnel and he wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more but the military personnel were actually approach and they have to taste quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't and some of them have but they basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where and why they were being done but in other cases there is good evidence also of um\nSurveillance of the of the object ... a good example on somebody um it was tied to coast to coast Greg bishops\nI'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay it of correspondents in the Nineteen nineties or with duck to call it ... who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself on Greg told me how you know back in the early\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet terra I'm all of the lectures that I wrote to each other back and forth were open on sale back down with type\nAnd I'm now they can clearly be done you know a family without\nSo each other back and forth were open and sailed back down which type\nAnd um that is clearly be done you know age late without making it look like they have but I was taught to open a race failed\nIt was all about Suzie whoever was doing they want to Greg I call it like to know that someone was opening their ... in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who\nAre not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know that there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which\nI I think many papers show Shiite them with capital ...\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons eyes and making Seventy one\nLosses or a livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's pretty substantial and when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he's clearly a rail one and it does seem to be tied to both capital mutations and\nUm the Eileen abduction phenomenon or one of the things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWherever flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up right outside of government you know it may actually\nHe may sort of do research and work for the government but it's not you know by the CIA or anybody like that fly valley cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program\nDesigned to do the work and\n... and most piping government don't know anything about it at all because he might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it may have been even sort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the faith ... when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the fate of information request so in that sense I think\nYou know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there are so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously near the homes I bailing abduct taste and and I can kind of light with college entering drag base might\nBe a degree of um intimidation but also it may be an attempt to just have an eye on the abduct taste um\nAnd be able to to respond to that high speed eighth in in the event that base that the papal climatic helps his were actually able to\nCatch in the ad abduction going ahead you know in the recession that very time\nSomebody who's tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation is black helicopters and we're saying yeah this happens but the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things that someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on there there're agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this stuff\nAgencies different agencies and government ... small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why ...\n... well yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we're dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm\nSure that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of an characters that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... of and I'm\nBorder of the United states in in the latter part to Seventy five and ... and just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so I think we're seeing a pot and\nOn and I think the violence\nAnd intimidation of sort of the\nThe mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out it's tough to\nFigure out what someone else is looking for when they put people through this you mentioned you bring up bubbles are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the ... corps bill's gone coming out in December and then there was a book I was going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on\nOne how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\nWell yeah I mean I you know what's on stories always intrigued me or I Know a lot of people dismiss you I ride but one of the things I've always found about law is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat can you follow Jay ... you know when the story runs out of fuel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on um you know they\nAre and I think that the big difference weightless or is he never embroidered on the ... the the original story be told as it was she's never expanded on it to the tells the same stories at eight Thirty years ago\nHe's hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't\nYou know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average hoax\nSo that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections between the abductions and people who claimed that in some way or another they\nThe the graze the Iranian grays new to the abductions that somehow they have this\nDeep and sort of sinister and disturbing interest in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read I had asked\nAnd they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to rate out and asked for this portion of very fifty while he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that would they\nBe aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the ... had some sort of obsessive eating trashed in in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct Hayes who were approached clandestinely by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still asked questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of your cell leaving your body\nUm did you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of do child with the story that was always tell him as well\nYou know you you look at a recent developments in regard to\nUFO topic in general and and of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the\nUS military the air force they stop project we both they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true that there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably as ridiculous topic um in light of the kind of\n... that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's a you know just information and things that sort of do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that\nPeople who are suspicious and are wary of this you know they were some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know they they shy angle of um rail abductions stop ... abductions the surveillance\nOr the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um you know a ... a rainy sort of a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um\nAnd again that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says\nYou know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why might they be fabricating and abduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events you know it's it's\nIt's not what we know where um you know being a ... just black and white you know it it's the the lines of rarely blood in

there is the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the end of the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real\nThey can't exist and therefore they don't know the disconnect between centuries of human experience and rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous\nIs there a way to reconcile the seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips\nNear death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book that offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nMath mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the going back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about why how could there be another direction or dimension to reality um\nYou know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant\nAnd they find that they find that it works um [noise] they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that uh the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations with cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on so and in fact just to skip forward to today\nToday you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even that's six Seventeen and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if\nYou are your members every audience her string theory but sure\nI'm using so yes there string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern in the universe their string theorists and I'm\nA theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem and it really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seem to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and so on 'em and these are Einstein's theory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of\nEquations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are assuming that there are\nAdditional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other questions that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the quantum version you know things like spooky action at a distance which of scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely\nVersion you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mystery is right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know\nThey're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having to set that equation that don't fit together and they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of\nOf quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well right in the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is about scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm\nA scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts and says I\nOr maybe we could use flat land as a illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land it I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah filing the great little book I'm so filings kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nBut it has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so that you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces\nAnd kind of dimensions we live and so you get to a great little book written by a I'm an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century\nI'm coming to come into age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant the religious and scientific at the same time um you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine with Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of um there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people\nTo get people think more about the possibility that um other kinds of worlds could exist um embedded in in our own make maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but\nHabits flat world was that was a two dimensional world but the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat\nAnd his populated by two dimensional objects objects with just linked with some of them were flat square some of them were by circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of the flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in in in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks out on his is filing the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I I'm\nWho looks out on his as violent horizon sees the appearance of this mysterious object and starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another another world and the worst as this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere\nRegards to a more extreme measure any he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and of course the\nThan the square looks around and look down on his flat world that can\nFor the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them though the square it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't\nCan't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... it's forbidden it's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher dimension so he has put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of year years and and the story ends with the four flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that uh his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of like\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts\nBut ah but the square character did have these wild often and even at the visionary experience right where he saw that there was that there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to think about the possibility that above our free spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the most diverse it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I can tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and\nGet into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea are very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil or you're trying to get their head around it as as

higher dimension of the new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual level level or worlds to reality ... in terms of an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he raises mathematics and geometry as a kind of a he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that was the way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his\nStory a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed as I say in the book you develop the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics\nLet's say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know well what if these what if these mathematical variables in my equation you know these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence\nSomehow um you know what if the math\nPoints up to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he developed over way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses\nIn order to catch glimpses into this into the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and then they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube\nYou know it's three by three by three um and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then hill and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative um exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself\nTo perceive beyond than the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think ah [laughter] you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while but he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um\nAnd doing your research but instead he he was doing things like\nPutting this is talk of the skew these cube sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gun which is one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure prints and he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that you know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these\nYou know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are seeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a priest and mistakes and I I Would think con men religious leaders who grab onto a do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of um as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so\nI ... ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both\nBoth of their um you know their writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas or spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book\nThe chapter seven chapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning the ... the fame\nFamous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he had corporate ideas about higher\nProbably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer\nHe uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he had corporate ideas about higher dimensions to rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he incorporates them in a number of sermons I'm at an end his writings and then of course\nMany people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um\nHe goes off to war and become disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situation OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings sort of an ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences you know disillusioned them turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about a chapter six which is a chapter\nReally about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like the chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit you explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else on higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah no drinks are fascinating and um your dreams or\nSeemed to be important than just about every culture around the world um you know and then many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the ... with a psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who is\nIs really important for people as they think about it are putting their dreams and so yes up people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams\nUm [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British aeronautical engineer also a soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too and he starts to have dreams that\nDoes that surprise him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin you know as he's camped out with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was\nMaybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but you would have\nYou have in them and he at first they wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress of battle and these kinds of things but you would have dreams\nAre and then he would wake up generally what happens you would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill\nTowards the ocean he's obviously on an island recognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in the streams\nYou notice is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the ... are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French but he's panic he's he's\nHe's tried to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows who's going to be a volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nKnow a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island of Martinique the French speaking island of Martinique 'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um\nAnd some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to thing I mean how could this be how could how could in\nIn my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google ... W done and you can go go in and check out his airplane design to his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it\nAs a family owned and local media group we look forward to help you this holiday season please contact me James Burton the director of digital marketing and monitoring media dot com today\nAnd window depot we want your home to be warm safe and ready for winter with options in pricing that's right for you we offer energy efficient windows from several manufacturers premium vinyl high income posit more real would and you'll always get honest advice from our local experts\nWindow depot is not your typical window replacement company right now say fifty percent of the triple main goal package when you buy more and more and more signatures series windows Charlottesville replacement windows dot com\nHi I'm Frank Emory with windows deep I'm saving America's energy one home at a time\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard\n... seven five and am twelve sixteen do you have\n\nGood morning I'm Brian down with WC H ve local news first\nYour top story on Sunday a domestic dispute forced Charlottesville police to lock down home an orange Dale avenue officers responded to the scene where a woman reported being assaulted by a man inside the home reportedly the woman was able to exit the home safely but police were unable to determine whether or not the men\nWere still inside the house according to the Charlottesville police department officers established a perimeter to investigate and confirmed the suspect had already left the scene no arrests have been made at this time but the investigation is still ongoing\nMore than a hundred volunteers will make sure Charlottesville area voters have a way to get to the polls on election day car to vote is a nonpartisan\nOrganization giving people free rides to their polling locations so their voices will be heard at the ballot box a team of voting volunteers served Charlottesville an album rural county that are also available for transporting people to the registrars office for\nAbsentee voting in person ... votes cofounder Gail ... said that over the last five years her crew members have taken hundreds of people to the polls car to vote runs on election day from when the polls open in the morning until they close in the evening for more information or to sign up for an election day ride call for three\nFour to six seven one five for seven or go to the Lincoln this story on our website at W.

capsules like a excellent you know enough it made me feel so much better\nAs a character that suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um you know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and\nOthers talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death and writer in a hospital setting others talk about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see it's a different route I'm In the hospital so\nOnce again another case in which\nUm you know you're you're raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this these incredible powers a vision that you didn't have before you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um so yeah people\nPeople and Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes uses language of higher dimension to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do a address say on this and the people's attempts to reach a\nHigher a ... hour or an another world um you know\nWhat's going on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not want to pass judgment on ...\n... yeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] yeah I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so\nYou know I Know deja vu\nI have had deja vu for sure yeah sure I've got 'em or so in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are having a you know and I try to put in place\nYeah I'm so in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are happy and um\nYou know and I try to put them play their voices and and how they understand what's happening um but I don't I don't know about finances you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing\nIf this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah and amazing really that than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these or does this is a cosmologist and read their read their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so\nI really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I I I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to sit here and say oh you know\nYou definitely there's no way that anyone can have an experience like that so I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would count as happened in and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond that\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book you know the bucket has all of these big questions um you know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and ghosts and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibility there and personally I I\nI Do believe that there is a world that we go to after the world and me personally I Am\nA believer you know I'm I Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I Would line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities on like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different opinions and the reader kind of decide what they're saying you know I'm a\nFull trying to take a call

B. briefly I talk about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads hints and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who we've talked about um and he comes up um and developed his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one of the young person and as um as an injured um and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of\nFeeling like he's out of time\nUm and he also have um he also has a unique experiences of\nYelling like it out of time a feeling like he's out of body and then he writes the great book that the caller mentioned are called man and hina\nUm and in the book you have all kinds of testimonials from people who have written about their pre cognitive dream the dream that pain to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nNineteen sixty two or three can't remember and he he asked the the viewing audience to write him letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever looked at a time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letter um from from the from the viewing audience but\nWhat many letters do extend the middle of the\nUniversity of Bradford I'd been there to redraw the letters and I I incorporate a number of them in my book\nWill be a Christopher white will take a break we're talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty takes at the end of the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions in a moment\nHe faces and people and all ... chairs and hair styles and it's just lovely have you ever tried slacks and exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditations on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or reflective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use in order to\nYou know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um yeah so it's about sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWell Marsha I just wrote that down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggestion that dollar [laughter] from things to the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal and I looked on the dream that my\nMother's husband who was that was going to give me a car and all my money so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that I Dreamed I wrote it down with ... with the data and and everything and it came true like months later [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his\nBook experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses on glimpses into the future and their dreams so that that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I thought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote few in remote viewing has it's drawbacks dishes um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the call super conscious mind and you can access these higher world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons weather's healing whether it's neat a loved one or for other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different beings how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is a is not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nA writing and ... it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shellfish I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYou know a guy I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions of it as a\nAs a dimension of consciousness right I'm In ... and you definitely have less than\nTwenty century psychologist and call you on that and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in and you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end that consciousness sort of\nUm occupies this the sort of a new direction um and yes
