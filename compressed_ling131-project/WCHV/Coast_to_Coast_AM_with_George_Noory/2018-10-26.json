empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning went to a hospital in Kansas City\nHe was administered a very controversial drug by the name of ... gland Ari G. L. A. and the generic version of it ...\nThis is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense for something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase you began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this all out of the human body\nAnd at this point Ralph took his life\nOver the course of a brilliant twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life to take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain\nBush and uh he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain\nAnd from what I understand the form

occurred since rough tragically passed on Jonathan ...\nI Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better or one of the things that's really help to me\nIs to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own\nSimple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability but I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for\nThe anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought in thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nDuring the cultural lead in we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the Hoover drivers situation what happened there\nAre so about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it on a look and I looked at him [noise] he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that in a ... he said I don't know\nAnd I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said he popped in my head\nI Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning\nAnd after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it and the mylar balloons state inflated for many months or two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n... I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\n... gets timing and secret city again and then you had to the currents with some strange bedroom light\n[noise] well I\nMoved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me and turn the lights back\nWith the light switch back down put it back up put it back down they went off\nThe lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off\nI don't put it back up put it back down and they went off\nThe lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off\nAnd at that time I left the house and just let it be a chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before it\nWas a point where you got angry about all this\nYou know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing um I don't I don't fault him I\nHave a struggle to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nOr they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning you\nKnow Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask is friends they would portray just the most honest I'm\nA likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay out of all they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood or die with\nHis friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there how did you get that call\nOh well I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh ... okay let's go to some culture for you Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question of story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's a relevant to\nA ...

Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile with a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build a huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes they have stores are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's with that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program could see community solar expand nationwide even globally\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter lately it's been two and a half light days\nOr two and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebelled and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nWhat was it that made you an astronomer realize that something\nQuite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nWhat was it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system really came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto big travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away\nAll sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should there should be randomly round the sky the fact that they're all off in this one direction you can only be explained by the presence of a planet that protecting their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October twenty Eighteen are about is one of those smaller objects that being swept off my whatever the masses will called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixty\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you need to people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through the ... Marion in all of that because it does come up a lot what exactly are rogue planet how can a planet\nBe wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planet and they come about\nFrom the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out\nUsually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one and in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if you could have gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely ejected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that\nThere's a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and things like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something massive like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize\nIf it were really coming it would be so bright that you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret and\nYou would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy\nGroup for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth were even out past Pluto out in the Khyber belt what would be the obvious observation all changes ... ... in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of\nBut it's nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets ... and you can figure out why it's ten\nWe actually think more like seven\nOr seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is Jupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system\nAnd nobody sits around in his worried the Jupiter suddenly gonna come destroy us planet nine is\nReally far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so its effect it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nYou if the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point we'll announce the existence as soon as we can confirm it\nOr we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there and then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\nUntil January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nOr it's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt or he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take us one you're so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\n... there you have it during an right from the man who discovered this uh in terms of those ... nations of those half a dozen bodies\nThat are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the uh or cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing these research\nProject with these scientists is that I have no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive that was trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the sun and mercury out to where I'm now Neptune and urine is our because Pluto as a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt that there's nothing they could be out coming this way\nDumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt that there's nothing that could be out\nComing this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity [noise] ... that's the thing about gravity and math at it it would have impact on every single thing and that's\nAbout all the way I would've loved those ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him up up at the bureau\nWell [noise] I don't know how much time we left but I can start up my own or ... that I\nHad a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations the lender because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\n... ... ... ... even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planets out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive planted but when you read ... let's say about the ... through scholar and you do the translation that we're a carbon Don\nAnd you look at the carvings one thing that always is confusing to me he talked about at twelve planet but in the tent a form\nDebt free and you don't have to pay the entire amount you oh there are debt relief programs that help people like you escape

forty six\n\nAnd won't go back to coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten whoa whose story next we'll deal with climate change window\nYeah you know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change and\nReal potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blankets around the earth and at the United nations\nMany countries especially those worry about being Ireland and we see level rise could flood and display population they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change often known as the eye can see the\nAnd the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis to help project some of these impact on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change many small island nation were so worried about disappearing ... rising sea levels\nThat the ... the committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty country to the question was\nHit him into restrict global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is stricter one point five degrees Celsius\nEqual to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit ... the the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now it's right because if we don't know if I planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees\nYou said from now because if we don't if our planet continues to warm\nUp above that limit at one point five degrees Celsius scientists warn there will be a catastrophe mass die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs\nAnd if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island the coasts populations to move\nBut to swear or the twenty Eighteen I PCC report said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity\nCoal gets as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author of the IPC the report says quote this kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend\nThat this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago in twenty Fifteen because\nHe is professor drew Janelle ... professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nations in the world that are now islands and other places that are most impacted by sea level rise\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries in large part of why we have this new report those countries want to the United nations to investigate lower warming target thinking the\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are the most ... I live in the south Pacific also older you've seen the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lawyer countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population rich very close to sea level Nigeria has huge population east ... street level but you know those photos most of the world\nWhere you go in the United states also has enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska in Alaska\nYou have an interesting problem where it's it's one of the nation rising sea levels and melt the ice\nAnd the ice protected shorelines from the waves from the ocean and without the ice the way you can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight\nMore easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already\nHaving to be evacuated and move to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coast and who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events now becoming quite common so I think that there are likely to have to be evacuations in the next couple of decades of at least some places\nThere's an island in the peak for example between Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nThat we've seen the water come up through the drain skin to Charleston South Carolina\nAnd Virginia where nuisance flooding that went very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments have had to put a marker so that\nMotorists can see how deep the flooding is just so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst flooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade to cope\nAnd dumped more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing\nOver the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models and then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of one who's been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic went like two or three times faster than the models projected\nYes the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen\nIs that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in New York\nWe've been observing\nFrom satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating so that is definitely a worry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized\nBased on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the dead below you know we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty eight team what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability is drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions and receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nMost respected radio sales team we're looking for excellent communicators with

may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams dreams of having relationships with an entity\nThat was giving the instructions I can describe it and the two as very thin very white pale density I couldn't see your face all I Know I Would very skinny it hadn't very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out and it didn't rain\nI remember the environment and being very luminous very white almost to where you were squinting your eyes but I remember this being listened to the strangest thing about it I was standing before it it was sitting in a very large\nRuin like chair but it was so then it seemed like a rope weather just dangling from mid air with Robie arms and it was just really creepy\n... you've had this as a repeating dream yeah and the ... that you were describing needs stream shouldn't use it possible that this very white being used in fact a reptile snake\nI got more that it was more like an insect than a snake because\nIt had a texture to it ... it was like you know what a insect wings look like they're kind of transparent but you can see those veins or whatever going through it\nWhen I Lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived there for a short time in Jacksonville and I was always outside and I love collect the animals and things like that but there are a huge praying mantis as they would hang out on the bushes the stand the same boat arms and the shape of its neck and it\n... says they would hang out on the bushes the stand that same day with arms and the shape of its neck and its body\nAre you standing in front of this praying mantis light and are you standing in front of it and it is in some sort of a crouched are sitting position\nI Want to stay in the city position because I see this big huge thrown like chair and its feet and then it's very very very large\nAnd so this is perhaps an eight foot tall praying mantis\nPossibly could be\nAnything specifically coming into your head from it as you stand there\nI think I can smell it I think it smells like rotting wood or something to that nature like the fence it to the nose\nDo you have a sense that there's any kind of closing or garment\nNo I don't think there was any clothing\nAnd the caller that is just praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like albino Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis issues that can be white\n... I don't think I've ever seen one\nDo you see anything in the I\nI don't remember the eyes it's almost as if I couldn't look at them\nI think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in partying something to me because I wasn't afraid it was almost like it was giving the instructions very strange I don't remember a boy's it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic\nAnd on the being the praying mantis essence seem to be blowing like I'm sure why\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was very white you can tell that it had a lot of texture you know if it was why it had like freckles I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had brought goals are almost like\nAn albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing every Chilean skin not a praying mantis skin\nThe texture would like that yeah\nBut the form was like a praying mantis into\nThat's how I Would describe it because of the arms they were ... and they were long but you could tell that they were joining could very strangely as I reach puberty I remember I started having a lot of glowing pain at one point I did find a spot on like when I\nWas like a puncture area that blistered I just had the dish and that maybe they were doing something with me to recover sperm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis what would you speculate could be humming further\nI think everything is speeding up now something is about to happen that's the feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of it's too late\nTo do anything about our current situation in something it's coming to either fix it or maybe help found out that I don't know\nBut whatever it was you would put it into the category of something positive and protective\nI Do absolutely do I've had many drains over the past few years involving a lot of water mostly\nAbsolutely do I hadn't many drain over the past few years involving a lot of water mostly how does the water emerge\nI've had many dreams that you know I mean he's from the ocean I wasn't surprised when I saw that film or the Indonesian tsunami that killed so many people\nWatch shuts off all of ...\nI have a feeling something to do with the ... the urge to get there's gonna be like a shift or a jolt\nKind of like you take a glass of water and you accidentally knock your elbow and the water splashes out from the rent them to go out that's the feeling I get from that I Am to foreboding feeling\nThat everything is going to get more violence in wetter\nYes I Know\nOf last night's real story well it is and things keep being woven this started with the\nIssue of a ...

a real whistle blower this is science\nWe said that he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six in which there could be some either a natural cycle\nOr something that is going to snap it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause tsunamis in tremendous amounts of flooding and I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural\nStrange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system\nThat could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis and that is how woven\nAnd a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading to answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information

child I Am fifty seven now\nBut at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five or Nineteen sixty six [noise]\nI was in my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to sleep here now\nFrom Winston Salem North Carolina to tell his own voice what's done to him as a child and haunted him to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nI Lived in Dayton, Ohio I was about four years of age I live with my mother and she had a best friend that she lived with a two bedroom apartment my mother had\nTwo children and my mother's friends had two children and we were all about the same age to two bedroom apartment\nAnd it's two levels\nYou have to go up to speed as we get to the to the bathroom and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brothers and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just in the dark\nI couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up I'll be ... no one to the window and I was just looking out the window where it was very quiet\nI decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window and I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet\nAbout it and hearing the cars that's how I knew it was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your car goes by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up just look up in the sky and you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between a park bench\nAnd so I look up and I see a light up a light light in the sky high soup that was an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky\nI notice something was coming down and by the time my notes that he may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet\nOff the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was an or what I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert and then they had the glow sticks\nAre neon green glow stick right\nIt looked like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it went in the innocent where a perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle a white lie in the lime green light there was no bleed over\nYou could clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall white began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYou know I could clearly see through it it was known metal nothing like that it was more like a balloon so the and it's like you're looking at a seafood for long\nI'm going to be seen what I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing that gal and he's looking up\nHe's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that that's a person can keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from the\nOnly reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out the screen and go down there you go on the beach\nYou [laughter] you know ... ...\n... what I was like man I wanted to go but bombs going to be nearby do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand that the key is the significance for this\nOkay so this is very close to you if you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular form\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this person looks like guy\nAnd then I thought I'm not going to say that unless the actually tells the God right\nThen I'll go man he sure looks like the guy the pitcher at church describe everything\nThe gal and he was wearing like when you're looking at the small white I noticed it was bright or brighter colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall white and bright white\nI can clearly see that the gal was white very bright white\nWas looking up and he was Caucasian and he had a brunette hair\nWhite ... very bright white he was looking up and he was Caucasian and he had a brunette hair and it came down to say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and it was just standing there looking up\nWas kids' hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say it was straight just like you see when you see these motion pictures of Jesus ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color of his I\nKnow I was a close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of the gallon\nFor I'm bored I could see it looked like it pulled over his head that all look like one quality and they went all the way down to is that you\nCould you see his feet in this your uncle craft\nNo I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his feet\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was standing at

I don't know if the word is to solve a but transform into gold or sparkly light and what you were describing it reminds me and the the people who have had this experience they all say that it is a bit like seeing your skin your body your hand everything\nTurning in to a like very fine gold sparkly dust that is a phenomena that I'm curious about and if anybody listening to coast so night knows anything about that specific it's not you're not dying\nIt is a transition that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then\nAfter they have gone a unconscious or whatever the missing time is they are back alive and remembering that memory extremely vividly I find that also a very interesting and wonder George if you ever heard of that\nWell what's what's fascinating to me is when you think about the biblical pictures that we've seen paintings yeah almost all the characters in Syracuse double or as around the head with sparkly lunch with\nYeah sparkly gold often [noise] that's true and what is this and I don't think that it is something being made up I think\nIt is a physics part of the universe and other dimensions that we have been denied or had never been told or ever educated about it's always been a thrown into the bin of miss solid G or something else\nAnd that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new cosmic understanding of the physical relationship between the ... the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have to be protected from another dimension\nMore and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions\nAnd if we cycle is this so is the important part and at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not all souls we'll go to the same dimensions\nThan recycling back into matter universes has to be a huge and common part of that cycling and we have been left dumb and blind about it\nOur first time caller Steve in parochial high Steven going it's or\nA hot Georgia Linda my question is do you think up to Seventy

maybe they're not returning but the government of foods using this national security and that the school you could do where people are at risk about safety that we would learn it could do a real good\nLord that you're doing and I understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years um where I began\nMy first investigation into animal needle Asians in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's\nTwenty eight teams which string charged was ... strange harvest\nAnd uh it was a a well received a documentary was awarded a regional Emmy\nUh so I was dealing from a chore as pure fact based journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself with the question of going out into pastures often by myself together to issue in and various things\nAnd my vulnerable and having to decide within myself that I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me a ...\nAnd I am still here\nAnd I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where animals mutilated animals are now what I'm trying to do is set a different lens and framework year\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet as well\nThose animal sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence that is today in the twentieth and twenty first century\nOr doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do an animal sacrifices but\nWhat ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular\nI think that there are many facets I think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without\nHelp from something else why the hell does it make it self front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact that humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet in the solar system\nNow that doesn't the fed and\nHumans being cruel to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible but I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human\nCreature that we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is until all of us know all of the truth\nThen animal mutilation that human abductions and all of the facets which seemed very disturbing may not be understand and be understood in a correct relationship to the intelligence is\nWhich seemed very disturbing may not be under that would be understood and correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting and

appreciate it by the host audience all end up my question is about CERN\nSpell the ... are and who neither yeah oh yeah exactly they have drawn collider yeah\nHe he far and yeah in Geneva\nYeah yeah exactly be hate drawn collider and job wondering if you've spoken to any of your whistle blowers governmental military scientific who have talked about CERN\nIt appears to be triggering some people say that that's triggering planetary\n... phenomenal throughout this operation it appears to be be area fifty one of the earth radical quantum physics and they appear to be doing some great work but they appear to have not just a public persona for perhaps a covert\n... you know side to CERN ... white Gary of fifty one\nWell I have heard these kinds of rumors but on the other hand I've interviewed gosh\n... by now I at least a dozen people who have been doing different experiments at different times it's the Large Hadron collider is the way that they refer to it\nAnd I think it started to uh because I have interviewed one of the physicists who was responsible for a proposal to see if they could generate many black holes in by getting the\nHadron Collider up to a certain speed but here was the reason and it makes sense to me\nYes they can generate a little black holes that could sustain for a certain period of time and they could make a measurement that there were any gravity waves moving in to the black holes this is the key\nGravity waves moving into a small black holes it would automatically confirmed ... another dimension\nAnd that was it seemed to me a legitimate to ... uh just based on all the reading that I have done with on foreigners work and others\nAre I at least ... what it was that they were proposing now that's one of the tests that was laid out a in paper or to do two or three years ago\nAnd there were headlines in the u._k. daily sensational newspapers and others that CERN was going to be making black holes that would destroy the you're the me black hole we're not going to destroy the earth in any way shape or form\nThere are probably many black holes being generated and proving away all of the time everywhere it was\nDesigned and that this is what's important\n... the Large Hadron collider is a great tester of hypotheses having to do with gravity and dark energy and dark matter and dark black holes and all of it and that's what it is designed to try to do and it's not very easy\nAnd so when there were these really\nTerrible headlines about many black holes being generated that we consume the earth it was just to me it was frustrating I Can't imagine what the poor scientists feel like\nAnd it's not true and therefore we are constantly getting ignorance and the Web that in many ways is turning into a cesspool where people are making a quarters in pennies on clicks through on any hits\nWell that that in many ways is turning into a cesspool\nWhere people are making a quarters in pennies on clicks through on any hysterical headline\nThat is not base with any kind of sad and unfortunately we have an administration that has been pushing all kinds of attacks and their claim on false ... a fake news is causing fake news\nAnd so this is a very very difficult time and I'm just going to the to the best of my ability try to keep putting one foot in front of the other\nAnd amassing as many facts as I possibly
