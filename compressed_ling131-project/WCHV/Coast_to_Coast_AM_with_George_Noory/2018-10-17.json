totally couldn't print a word to show he took refer refuge in the United states and became a regular contributor to the Washington Post your\nHe started before he got in the twilight zone user writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine\nI'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into was that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writers job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors were getting this way\nAnd he it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for a ride he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loves fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff\nBy if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a TV series that just had a\nCruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say that has to say something about something\nAnd you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice\nUm rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning in ... that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea that um we have this\nUm this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction is all television series and the only black and white TV series\nFiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced\nSo well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in what we had was called the after dark newsletter\nIn a bread bridges loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about by ... by shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I've got\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nWhat rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific that is\nThat's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty Nineteen Seventy five that was it\n[laughter] he smoked a lot though didn't he yeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got that\nIn in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did him in you said that brought the ... do well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's\nYou know this couple of things that are really really impressive it that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so they do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with him about a about the twilight zone and Nick ... with us his book is called the rod Serling his life's work in an imagination\nIn an age at hackers and data miners never been more important to protect your personal information now you can with my the that the only ... you live\nOn the way you do like safely and in complete control nice you know combined secure communications with private browser virtual credit card security features that you can start shopping sale\nSocialize put out and I think you're paid I met her get out of south email for credit card again usually like to do I need to stay safe secure and download my sit down for today and get one year free\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHey and welcome back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick per E.

example it's a good life in praise of pit long distance call with a guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfields\n[laughter] yeah they sure yep\nThat'd be the end as a matter

still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we returned to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it's still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got six notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd we knew you were in those episodes and they were being done was runs surely around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah and he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nA twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up and the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know everybody\nGets a little uptight though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around them\nDid he talk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd that's how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe in these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James shelled and he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet\nI Want the guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days what's new\nWell Angela car right now I have just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing in time\nAnd go charge on purpose it's called the devil Sikhs with her and she kind of an old adversary has weapons\nWill use your cell phone with them or for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm you know throw an ancient aliens and you know I'm play on the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music too\nYou know keep ... thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick ... and I was thinking George so that was great\nHe was a I did run certainly for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] he may my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to read the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he's written a you know so much of it that was great and I I just wanted to collect all this information\nElect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually I'm done this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete\nA list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced or television or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what she wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been there haven't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know dealt into in ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you and your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly in some is in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman\nAnd this really just\nDestroyed route certainly wants to sell some version of the story\nAnd Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of the script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these in a interference is came into play\nAnd there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television wealth but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because I'll I'll spoil it for you and now it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that noon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated and he was um you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just kind of it just took away his faith in humanity\nThat something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it throw them into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was\nThis could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that one of the producers on the twilight zone\nWere contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we've got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the\nThe assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruit said listen that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through a pretty quickly and they had it they have it ready\nJust texture ZIP Code to eighty two thousand\nI'm Amy Carter director of development for the American Heart Association in Charlottesville\nTake the first step towards a healthier lifestyle at the Charlottesville heart and started clock on Sunday November fourth at ...

jak caught me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote or called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming [laughter] you know there any way we can\nMake this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know this and we just can't you don't have the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm just gonna film whatever he does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason going nuts are\nWell aware that President they say why like radios theater and they take some of the old episode ... ran for radio and they also incorporate ... date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when they had to do with\nA nano robots eating up um oil spill in the problem is that Greece and and I just thought that it thank you and I think with the ... they\nCool did you know about that Nick\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no it wasn't aware of a of the current one now\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first cells were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that era and I think on CBS um CBS network\nAnd the road you know for radio or in college\nAnd so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work\nIn Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you and it was a series of Thirteen um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or well he once he lived in most and Pacific palisades where most of his a professional career and then he always went back to a if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was it a prolonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it\nWas pretty sudden he you know he had\nLouis or did you go suddenly um [noise] well\nIt was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\nUsed to ... years old wasn't even something like fifty yeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypass procedure which was who was in New York at the\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take of the artery from this here and play here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains\nThe surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were showing 'em up he had another attack on the table\nAnd that was pretty much a Steve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi George or I get a little trivia but a ride a uh I live in central New York from Seventy two to Seventy five\nAnd I worked on a military\nBase called cynical army ... we are close okay and I would say a big a big arsenal that had nuclear weapons are quite a few actually it's been on the news\nAh anyway rods home woods had bought two or three miles from that day\nAnd a a little town called ... up the road by Mao and a half or two miles was a little post office where are you ... where I used to have a ... and that's where rod huge Sendai yeah\nWhen he he had a a swimming pool built on its property there a couple of miles away right next to the a base ah oh it's actually an arsenal and uh I used to talk to the or\nA postmaster sort of like a one room a post office and I had a I heard ... said yeah it comes to and once in a while and I always wish I had met him but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he is the uh since it's taped to Los Angeles to or the or contrived\nIn too is a TV program and uh\nYou know he he already you know as I say you live right on Lake ... uh an in Ithaca and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the some of the tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started the sink a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it or where it somewhat than a little cemetery called the inner lake and right on the lake in much the love that area in its wife or when they first got married they had their honeymoon there a\nOn a lake or a ... a her relatives parents probably owned that property and he bought it eventually and they live there and they always went back there on\nA summer to uh write and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is he used to do a little radio uh promotions for uh people he know in the area like she or whatever\nMight be on store I mean that was kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out yeah absolutely\nSo I mean it's kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely in every ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a negative sounds like he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah you absolutely and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to the wire rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received\nPersonally or you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he

blow to root for you or you can go directly to a university press in Mississippi website um along site but if you Google that I'm sure you'll uh you'll come up with that there as well\nTell us about the rod surely memorials foundation\nI'd love to hear some of I'm a member of the board of directors of the foundation at say Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for rod Serling has a legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we call them Serling fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention or people have come and spoken and throwing his daughter and Jodie Serling they've both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had pal discussions and radio perform scripts radio scripts performed um so I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for 'em and bring him in his home town he loved his hometown a and that should come to come across through\nSeveral twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue before and they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton so these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I Would love to have had them on the show necklace\nUh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so\nIn a class of chance or would have been something else what a great interview what about oh yeah oh yeah he always was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Lynda Barry\nMining mc ... Tina and I'm going to carry\nA that was a classic one of my favorite episodes also the man and the radio\nAre you talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found the ... on the radio in\nThe in the attic and how it played music and shows that only he could hear the plastics\nAnd also George I wanted to um\nAnd how it played music and shows they'd only he could hear the plastic\nAnd also George and when they do um I went to praise you for um how you thought up this show tonight I mean after after lick is that is a guest talking about holidays artifacts and they're they're tied in together so many twilight zone episodes about\nHighly doubt Oh absolutely I've gotta I've I've got to give credit to our executive producer Lisa lion and Tom Dan how's your producers for putting that together\nYes and also make I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw\n[noise] you know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what toilets and upset with the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um ditch hiker is one that I I think it was definitely one of the one of the first ones I ever saw but whatever\n... right\nYeah going my way and these have been chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing up and it's just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip um that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land and then you we do you look down and you could see a the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just it kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know ... you know Raj brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd it was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually uh consult Iraq consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they did it ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother offer advice on those so he actually got a technical consultant credit on on that particular episode\nNext stop we go to Brad Bird in the angels camp California Hi Brad Bird\nHey Nick was I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling\nA tail it involved what they call the frog die that was and a half so um\nIt started with a guy at a bar looking kind of despondent or whatever and and uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up and gave him a a match but said call this number\nAnd uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to take it was going to a place where they gave him this capsule and they said but the the one the one caviar is\nYou cannot drink to get money not drink because he's a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very\nVery uncomfortable I'll give you a really bad stomach reacting and so what it was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it said on alcohol ... it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up and then if it would just you know\nCrave the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause it was growing\nThat sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I could tell you that's for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not necessarily\nOr are they does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not a certain like\nThey were so many classic shows no they all these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at the racetrack board and you'll get the winning divorce and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera was called an accent is one of the you know your previous caller was talking about a pointed artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of its own you know they they had plenty of those the you know the telephone that ... movie was talking about they talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the\nYou know where the Gulf and sort of you know so to speak of that particular episode\nMarion Rock Hill South Carolina hey there\nHello their yard was always a player that next year I was where he is a God of our ... our love and the ... and ... and so for that matter of fact I got to a ... one of my favorite story that you are just before that\nHow 'bout that Raj serving as Logan those nasty cigarette\n[laughter] now it's unfortunate really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never you never could quite do it\nAll the years to either here really low cigarettes or Darla the rover player here a lot of them are just ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the set smoking wouldn't he\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just there was it was it was attached to him it was given a constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it\nWas the thing sure crazy let's go next to too many well in the San Antonio Texas I menu well\nI Do enjoy good morning good morning to you too thanks
