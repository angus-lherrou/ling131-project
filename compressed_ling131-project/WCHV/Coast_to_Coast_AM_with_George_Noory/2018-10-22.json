else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it was ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoopla project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAnd I knew that there was Native American history with a topic that ran deep\nAnd I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California and I coordinate down the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you could break down some doors for me I'm not going to\nI'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey you can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started\nAnd uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town starting to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans\nAnd I found a diamond\nUnbelievable look an individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just quick like brothers and when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery\nAnd draw the sketch or the suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due to schedule the suspect that is how accurate this man has and so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we took a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury and I'm\nKind of how it started\nA you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps and the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most local the most\nCamps and the big world right oh bingo or\nSomething I started the most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who drew the sketches Harvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were set in stone disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah there were huge yeah they had hair all over the body there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say\nHarvey you nailed it that is the sack Lee ... you look like and when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribal people aren't animals or people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least the coexistence right\nYeah ... ... in the tribal area and met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe a and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there\nAnd this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see I'm\nThe only thing about the ... areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nOr has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through Hooper from willow creek\nYou'll notice that there are more Barry Bush is on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seen eating at a lot but\nIt's just an odd coincidence\nYou or I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm\nLiterally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there is sufficient evidence that something is real here that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo\nSeveral years of walking down that path I knew the DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life and there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible\nMany of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a PHD name Melba catch them\nDr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to issue\nDouble catch them Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blooded cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to\nTest to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of 'em were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came forward with a tissue sample blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what the showed was that the bypass it went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side\nTo the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan into that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ... and\nUnbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation and they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written\nBefore I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nA very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um eh observations that didn't belong in the paper but the the DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results\nOr it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nThat people are saying going to say well how do you know let's pick for their well big for heroin looks different than any other mammal hair in the world and I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big for her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs\nHair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA but if you pay attention\nBig but here it's an entirely different so if it if they didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that number did to extract this DNA and to get the results and\nThere's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's going to like the you up all world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes the cake their passion to different levels um to the point of Roger let 'em material um\nAnd ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part of a second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual\nBut it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human match on gender thing and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that are big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe that bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study\nThey've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it and they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online\nAnd see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figured this out um it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got gonna thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um you you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\nWas well I'm ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles or from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories the having the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight now did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seem to admit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description\nTwenty four years eight gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a\nNew article and the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentation just genius is a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of big\nFoot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same location that's the big\nFight [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement\nAbout giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nThe big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... and showing the legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed and they came up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWhy did these articles pointed to a some universities would get um\nWell why did these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidates were all these went and it set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't how\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Maryland that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an elder a witness sees this on the self worth of a rubber an animal between twelve and fifteens de tie\nIt's a shape resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the seat or two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned\nBecause nobody talks about it but when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except ahead which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so\nThat Julie hearts on head of the bullying prevention center a nonprofit pays or does it takes a lot of courage

these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nYeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that has a lot of injury to because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual\nThey have a lot of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it\nAnd it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just cuckoo it fail you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they ... and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just bone and get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio and Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because I mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties\nWhere the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there were people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived a\nPlug factly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish civilization\nAnd cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's ... with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me\nThat have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts and then when\nYou think about present day fighting's again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the uh descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot and how it's kind of strange\nIt was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's a similarity um some of the descriptions I I I wouldn't have to live through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing\nWhich suggests to me maybe they were humans maybe read they really were literally ...\nMen have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe ... maybe read they really were literally wild men out there\nWell then usually\nOccasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but\nYou know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared\nYou know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm ... if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico on the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact\nWhere there's this association between big foot in UFOs even in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and close time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars\nAnd they're they're not once they have your trust that will tell you hey you know there's this association between us and them and there are different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people to die hards don't like it the UFO diehards like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all but\nYou have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are in the wake you up those are where they're from but um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are\nReputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo\nThis is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends\nTheir parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that and he goes you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in a while\nOut there and talk to them and that's all I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in a wall Mike how will come back from nowhere completely milk\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my TV and Rowley and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got their\nSo called dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust somebody to dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot ... a cow sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take the earth or they're an omnivore\n[noise] [noise]\nI'd here we go calls where am I guess they ... the first time caller Gwen in Pittsburgh hike when\nThey're um thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome back involved\nDavid I have had many sleepless nights listening to everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time\nSo good job on your finding um I Want him to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you were saying how it's related to wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or off though is that way that we could find out more about wild man because there are Amazonian tribes that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea is revolutionary and I feel like within the next ten years will definitely have an answer if he has his own and my question to you is easy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding their foot that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people uh hasn't worked real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the law and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush go onto the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have kind of touch on it for the people here your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big like can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounter them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal browns they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and uh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was\nA just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you can hear it it ... I mean it was just taking these giant stride it in October garbage cans you had alarms going off then the police officers chased it\nAh I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I should call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we describe on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the bowl of light started stretching\nUh that was floating just off the off the ground in the middle homes that they are on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um I've seen it\nOver the you went to Beijing so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know um west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program how you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph stealing sniff the one who talked to keen on his saddle\nUm he thought big foot it happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another town the girl across light and here's an awful lot of time that the prophet and he ... he ran into ... and ah he described Cain as the\nAs a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle and\nAh just until the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm I'm there\nI'm personally wander here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or that destroyed their souls says you brought that up I just thought\nThe Mormon culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two stories are really famous that story than just chilies this too is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and that then lay Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one\nUh came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand [noise] uh uh Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest into calf\nCame out and so he loves his hand and they just crashed a cashier and king [noise] and so it's interesting you say that because in our church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush like let's not talk about it but\nAs people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot you thinking like he does he have any idea what's going on because like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you ... everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person\nNo expert in their family and then there are certain social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely the go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that\nLikely a big what type encounter or is that something else\nWill the description that the Smith gave was would match Bigfoot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big foot may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nNow Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about\nThoughts and things I've always stated that I'm a man of facts\nAll of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA but\nAgain if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands\nThat has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening now\nAnd I should point out that you know you did address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for regarding people off as far as you\nWell know killing them I I think all of them okay there's there's a story that John\nGreen wrote about a prospect that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit\nI followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came came to pass\nI remember that story no yeah that is a good when is it there are some other held in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nAnd ring a bell you know they

year I Can't think of anything I have read in the last five years\nThat affected me as profoundly as what we're about to discuss you know I saw a review of this book months ago I knew we had to check it out\nAnd it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rubbing the writing is superb the research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours for anyone who's not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to one of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Roberts draws character went delivered a moving powerful\nSlightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shifts and I'm\nA small park that's a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle is over an hour where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the faithful journey\nHad that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters um victorious at us and now as well as nine other major battles but instead she went back to their island California for repairs\nAnd that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan projects including President Truman\nDecided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb little boy which would later ... to head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time\nUh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport these ... components of the bombs she did that are made of record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on Tiffany an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those needs the from Guam for the Philippines and all my street west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or stays in the middle of the Philippines the\nOn July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight or she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she noticed how she might have fired exposed for he does it Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely lose a foul off the shift Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down in twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick about three hundred men went down with the chefs are\nA little under nine hundred made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds\nA little under nine hundred made it into the water alive\nAnd when they made it into the water those who survived their ruins were very optimistic if they were going to the rest and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've gotten hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis she was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights and four days in the water and only three hundred and sixty men survive\nBut Sarah secrecy plays such an important part in this and every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and it did did you did sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr wanted to share with us the how secrecy or a ... which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to go to the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that held secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days and\nYou know first of which being how messages where transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first things I'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was\nProtocol that noncombatants ship the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive tenet thought well I guess I don't have to report that either and\nSo he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then\nBeyond that you know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines see\nReporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes had been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so you know he should not have been there without an escort he should have had you know taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns\nAnd so she should've had something you know first of all that so in our in the second of all that had\nAny harm or ability you know the armor too yeah and armor I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruisers so her armor was exceptionally sin compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she's saying so quickly\nI remember was exceptionally sin compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she saying so quickly\nOr you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy of this mission and why she was out there and why this information was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions\nKnowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTold me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of that they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know\nAt the screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the accurate story however hurting however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was uh it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're using them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a A R stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back to land on the Indianapolis story because really the man uh before I get passionate is just to to\nCircle back to him the man who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army named Robert an army major named Robert Feldman\nAnd who has spent the last couple of years after the war renting down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb\nUh on the continent of Europe\nSo once that missing was completely and then burn and carry decision about components of little boy attending an island\nUm that is the final grading gathers every year and and if the if it conflicts and so in writing the whole book we tried to pull back that lands and bringing in a lot of and either a characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view so in addition to murder we had him for the call and tell me you've got to leave and come highly commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where to begin to recognize it even those men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing well\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make ... um\nWell it was it and then more for published after the war first in Nineteen fifty two Japanese language\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men or had him at a point of view and there was a chapter on it voted Indianapolis\nBecause we were looking at the larger or in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nHe was a commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors after ... radar and more technology for his that marine because\nThat means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his rather than commanders go down to\nThe end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of it is rather sad commanders go down to solve the grave for lack of technology they're carrying had a wife he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun\nUm we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and get even more information about his later life have before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean you you took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court martial for captain McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to uh the moments right after these torpedoes slam into decided the Indianapolis\nOr chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yeah\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if we would say it's lucky for ... the clouds just parted and the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nGetting the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations they had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so\nWith the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt first to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to his skate from their compartment and limbs and mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after the ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out for over a mile and a half is what they believe\nAnd you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in ... they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who could help them you know a fellow ship made or whomever\nAnd others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead sailor and put it on them I mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just\nI mean this was incredibly chaotic so scary and these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or months earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there are just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship at the last moment\nWe tend to read ... actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer and you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel\nSo no one's in really great shape you\nKnow by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe there's a shift in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nThat and there wasn't you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly to um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding it because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place in these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there was some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe current they move about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will and so two men that we'd be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled Sundays it's it's clear as glass says on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve twelve along with these current so\nOver time over the course of the the five nights and four days the men become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote that from altitude\nRescue plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they\nWere invisible and you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one at one real hero was I'm a captain parks he was the commander of the marine detachment that was aboard the ship and the largest swimmer group and the water's the they did\nAs Sarah mentioned the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nHappen and they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men and kept in park was in that group and he really than\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep the men together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets was a single line that was about a hundred feet long\nAnd so they formed that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd captain park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from a dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times and he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations\nAnd and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all got to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nThan men are even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place\nI'm worse there was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and there was hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nAnd reaffirming their being taken seriously and action plan that also helps and it happens again there's much more he's or

interviews Sarah found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted was that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had been kept in the day\nHe was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander bills or um started captain bill Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... any\nAnd bill Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do with talking with him you know\nBut he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter explaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty\nAnd you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a group of survivors\nAnd captain McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because you know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from family didn't veal he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how was he received a when\nHe was received with open arms he he's very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it that when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they just they would be playing right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nAnd when captain make they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs someone shouted attention on deck\nAnd everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the class and and ... came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were re feeding him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSarah talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records to share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past than and if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us paint the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so we tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nWe would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist and so interestingly enough you know a a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grants\nAnd it doesn't exist and so interestingly enough you know a a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and saved fifty three men his ... his grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I was trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed\nThose final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed in so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed and the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because\nYou know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the life of media Lee after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves but for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue only to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort carrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nI actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them ... got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise] um\nAnd you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholics and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families and they held it in for years and years and years and um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about that today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that Robert George character in jaws you know you got that story bottle up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys\nBut the Robert ... character in jaws you know he kept that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm a that's a very moving scene at it and that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in in the book oh Sarah did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when let and I've got across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know\nOne of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from John So it's an essential part of the stories history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home\nSeveral accounts came home saw the movie\nOr really impacted by it and especially this thin and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about well so yeah it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way that that you know how your dad served in World War two so\n\n\nZero here with me your thoughts when you heard the news I think it was last year that the Indianapolis had been found a there's a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill ... who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the ... group which was the vessel that\nRecently responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts and they were the first ones to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their shift had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened in that it happened in their lifetime\nWhat mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a famine Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nOn winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt and\nInland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they were they were not entirely helpful and every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from\nBoy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Sam Koch who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we said while through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and\nAnd give the entire history and draw new analysis that various things that happen in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think oh boy we were we nervous about that that he\nIs it director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think a boy we were we nervous about that that he really really has endorsed a story and as we meant as his full court since he saw which is what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm hopeful big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in ... California as a personal connection to the story I jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... uh to rescue those shelters in the water and I still have been one car being used in shorts and still you know\nAnd I never saw him I ... years past ... years ago but I never saw him cry until you try to talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he a whisky on the USS that peace will take the oil or the path that you know the name of the shaft that to me I\nDon't know I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone and I was just thinking about that before I call not hot yeah what was the name of the ship but he said the ship was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talking you know it was horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about\nEgypt all that and all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just if you're part of the ethos of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he he was in World War two and Korea or he was governor dream dinners made for each class you know but he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years but there is an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he would support the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same case it didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he needed it at that had been found could probably buy a submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um\nA sailor his spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and head of the captain ... they tried to get everybody out of there said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene\nAnd his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with the rescue so they'd be interesting if your dad this had been on that ship\nThanks jury appreciated wildcard line running used in the morning on good\nOr my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de oil he was twenty six years old he was the end soon doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess she just you know of all of his memoirs\nAnd I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the ...\nAnd I witnessed account a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea and it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks\nIt talks about the fact that the polls these guys up kicking the sharks off their rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the view of the doctor and it was my dad and he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this\nBut the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account\nIts its history its historical I Would love to share this with a young ladies if I can get out of getting information and\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna O R R gal there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing\nThat I I'd like to see that myself things you are so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClams I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think they can arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um\nHow how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but
