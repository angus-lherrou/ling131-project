I Would lose money in a bad scene that you would write a book about consciousness how the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was\nAbout two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people who've talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bottled up things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body\nSo that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in finance and consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense\nIntense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days\nAnd ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a cold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nAmong the perfect meal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture of reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nArrived without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no\nWould science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggests that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences [noise]\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just a loose nation that happens when someone about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and\nThey're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark ... bird

implications for everyday life we're going to take phone calls next hour with Mark I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSound like a nice ... pre cognition so let's see how that all

about his work in into upside down thinking\nMark ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very right here that uh but I think I Hope people that the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until I put the pre cognition tell like as a psycho couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science they controlled study that hadn't been done on this topic and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation\nWhen they should my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating to look and then she came she came out with some ... things but what did you find\nIt yeah it's a lot but he's a very important phenomenon it's\nIt's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like to laugh at the and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective does not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo ... the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should\nSay that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the results\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section and his book called six sigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds that the that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and intellect to the we have six sigma results\nSo the ... experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experimenter Z and the experimenter say Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture James looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow when we ... the law of probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent so from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it\nSuggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because\nIf we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time you're instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you where they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender having much to do with it\nI I I think that's a receiver\nMight have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications\nIt worked communications with the deceased through medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room in simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them what do you think would happen\n... well I think\nWe'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies in uh the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me on the program is sometimes referred to as Stargate Program\nAnd use psychic spies for national security purposes many of marine I've been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which have been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one but remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocument um say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter] [laughter] so I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's a page on a science channel and there's some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we looked at these uh tell a path to studies\nAnd I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used a ... I'm not sure what the government\nHas found other people and they've continued these kinds of mind the studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote\nThey are confirmed that remote viewers were used to find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether\nIt was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful so you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark a very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens and they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a pre pocket and dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nTearing quicker faster and more tailored were pulling more collecting morphing into community and then through the sensors in real time they found him\nThey kind of getting credit and get care if there is any injury\nNielsen said the department will be able to alert state and local officials to hacking attempts quickly\nMari and everything can dial a I've been around the country talking with different secretary\nIt hit the year for the department to notify state that Russian hackers had screen their systems during the ...

previous life and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and\nThe researchers call it a third doctor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On the go ahead\nHi George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how\nHigh thank you for a ban on the show\nSo I'm back in two thousand and one I experience actually I told comment was seven but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nAnd I had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian and an instant now\nThere was no one around no um food now animals that I was by myself and I guess I'm\nI like to know people that are tell a path that now you said that people are are usually good with meditation I haven't done a lot of my pet meditation in my life but I have been on my own a\nTremendous amount of time I'm at a deep thinker I'm spiritual and I think I'm an empathetic person so I wanted to know\nIf these qualities allow people to be more\n... path again in addition for about twenty two years I've seen\nDouble and triple digit I'm On the clock on email addresses license plates and whatnot and nominate has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um\nI I kind of thinking that this might be a tell a path experiences well\nSeeing something like two two two on the clock\nI'm thinking important message it you know something important in your life seeing these signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nNo awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe the Bible or some religions it's the body and mind spirit soul and so I kind of\nAnd so I kinda think that what your home is that for ... the tone [laughter] they're\n... or the other person is it's outside and inside her or either or but um I I kinda think of it on ... what what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the same what do you think\nIt thank you for your question on ... um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a world tool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body dies that's like a whirlpool dissipating and the water does that leave the stream it just transitioned into a different state\nAnd so the water to me it's consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a whirlpool or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or it's a supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if from consciousness meaning that\nConsciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life what's your brain's off it's over I mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that\nConsciousness does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body so I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences\nWhat people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain is either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through chains eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods so it when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things through consciousness cognition selected the ... and things like\nYeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's the subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained I think their abilities\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nAre you doing sir great I'm an ex\nMilitary and I will tell you I don't believe in ghosts UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was assigned to a multinational units two thousand six in Iraq\nBut by the way we are trying to preserving first night wearing\nCase that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nWere able to use what I understand if the remote viewing from a section of the S. three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a bus and some buildings were able to find that three you Avi and\nThe person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in a was ball and I believe he was an albino which is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli defence from what I can get\nOf who I dealt with over there mhm my\nQuestion is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more in tune ...\nNot ... not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers\nAll over the planted a dozen skew anything specifically\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research is deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ah he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that's outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing but\nIt's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nBarn unfortunately with me only because of my

welcome back to coast to coast our final segment with ... market can we concluded that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nIn that it survives outside of the physical brain than physical body but it's there it's out there in the east or I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we've discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like telepathy psycho Kinney says pre cognition\nNear death experiences children with half life memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt gets that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show\nContinued lesson you thinking as wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my uh my question is all you can get other got tons of callers a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us\nAnd so they can consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil how this free will play a part in for a fact consciousness and I'll take my reply on right to free will have anything to do with a mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the body having free well are we talking about the consciousness itself\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is consciousness so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps at an individual that is\nConsidering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concepts that we are talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can't conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists but what can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit of trauma understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to deal with is how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might have interplay with consciousness but from the bits and pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt that the ability of the mind in the ass\nThe the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in and he said it's uncanny suing somebody goes into Las Vegas upbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results were uncanny\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before a make a statement I like the uh respect of this to disagree with a that a the as a bill about the effects of a drug this Bush and the on the mind uh you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ...\nI'm a you know as you the person speak him into a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be a consciousness\nAnd uh the play back of that tape recorder a you know if the papers wrinkles clinical those something will end up playing it just started a voice a distortion that would be an example of the drugs mind\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus is I'm\nBringing about a distortion of what consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in his two clarity that's you know the wholesome of consciousness that went into it\nUh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a a spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a example of a active consciousness of this ... this thing outside of the body that\nUm you know a little ever paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise a telescope nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhat do you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can't communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind ... Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chant information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this they just think that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be to the east and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think of some mediums do you think are some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think the\nThe point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nHave real abilities\nAnd the wind bridge Research Center as one example where they they heavily screen the mediums and these people are able to do things you can explain\nI'm also looking back historically there are many cases back sometimes from the Eighteen hundreds of people that were studied rigorously one is named Mrs piper\nAnd she was studied by William James ... ... the famous psychologist and a detective follows her around to make sure that she couldn't get information from normal sources and she was able to do things that were amazing so I think it's possible that some people have extraordinary abilities\nLet's go west Steven's with us in Eugene Oregon now Hi Stephen\nGood evening you know George were always saying there's no such thing as coincidence rage I'm ...

and the board with completely reset up there was one\nOh I went up to it you know just in money and I I I find them yeah I\nI'm barely hearing you Matthew can you get closer to your phone\nYou hear me now [laughter] there you go All right so um [noise]\nAnyway there's a lot of the area that they transport sitting on a table and the author was completely reset with one of the pieces move so I decided to you know just\nTo be funny and I decided to move on the other ... out an accord\nOh boy do totally another one moved\nUm I didn't need my round and when I got back another piece of rules\nAnd there wasn't anybody there that was playing around with you\nThere yeah the lobby was completely empty jeeze and it happened like four times [laughter]\nNot where they're making good chess moves\nOh [laughter] really the game had just started I wouldn't know\n[laughter] well I only goes\nI actually got my cell phone I was like I'm I'm finished [laughter]\n... you know this is a little like a\nComic Denise ... says of course Ron have you seen objects move when you've been on the case\nAbsolutely it of course I just told you earlier about the book that flew off the shelf yeah but it's still oddly he says that there's a famous case of a a Boston sports writer who was friends with a wrestler by the name of who was the\nThe who was the angel French angel or something like that and ah he used to play chess on all the time and eventually this this wrestling died and he had a a a death best mate or or or a buster is his head\nAnd he bought one of those like trying to chess games in so he's he like chess or continue playing but then he realized one day the chess thing was never plugged in\nUh he actually called it a couple of people from the uh the at the University in ... in Boston and they couldn't explain that they moved to the bus to ... and everything in or if we continue to make these moves even though it wasn't\nA plugged in and uh he swears that he believes that was his friend he\nA fringe angel ... still playing chess with them in the afterlife\nHow many of these events in a entities are mischief makers as opposed to trying to hurt somebody\n[noise] I think it's it's overblown as far as trying to hurt somebody um I mean Maureen in line so I have gone I'm On an extra systems with the Catholic Church where we're talking demons versus a um you\nKnow spirits yeah there there are some ...\nThere are nasty and or to\nBe quite honest with you or having a trance channeling channel is sometimes like Maureen can be a little\nA nerve wracking because uh there was some ... actually don't like me and when you give them a body they for\nYou know they they use it sometimes she's drawn on line [noise] she's throwing me across the room before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so early in the air it can be nasty but I I think the the most of them are really not\nMarie in not you've written about Ron having your back what does that mean exactly\nYeah you know one have made that we've worked together for so many years on and then the beginning you know if I started to trans channel you know he would try to call me back meaning weight you know whether you're weightless I'm an opera him army and what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that written on on where I Would talk to Iran and say you know in my mind I Know what I might appear to be out of control in my mind\nAnd actually you know talking to the spirit or trying to you know to connect more or get into more of what they're wanting and what's going on\nSo now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out to help me in a situation that's not safe\nUm he's right there so that having my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't kind of touched me and go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to them\nLet's go to urban and a state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing\nLove your show um along because as a I live in the house gets to hundred and five years old\nAnd my age I have met Monday haunted experiences that house it's crazy it's actually kinda funny rarely 'cause I I ah really only have any like hope the guy's activity when I I'm trying to fix the house\nIf I buy Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I spend doing your ... the majority in the house and I come home and uh\nThe there was a cop adore about three feet away from my style that have been ripped off and driven down through by glass off though it was like if\nPart of their ... and I\nGo into my bedroom and it takes\nIf I go into my bedroom and it would take him to one of my TV say strays and you don't like the guy and set off the front of the couch you know if they can that set it off on my bed\nAnd ah I think I ... I I my wife and my kids have actually seen a kid and a lady uh I I actually I've never seen that those that iceberg them I've heard like the footsteps iceberg slamming doors\nSo you're pretty convinced that are there\nOh there there is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh I guess my question is is\nWhy why when I fly to do something to fix the house is that when they seem to get banks\nWildly they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nYou are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best I mean it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually started things out\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do summer fun summer having a good time other evil what decides whether they're good or bad to Ron in terms of that\n\nI think it's it's who you are and this this life and if you don't change you're pretty much who you are on the next life so if you have to deal with the court accordingly of there are some times\nWhen I um don't speak vice lead to um as as some people like in ... but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if there are being and knowing or being\nA offensive to to those who are running this realm now it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respectable\nScore to Giovanni in Los Angeles alone Giovanni\nA outgoing jarred it's well thanks I'm and I'm Glad to be back glad you guys defy coughing again truth thing a wrong\nGreen ... up there and be careful with with uh with all the stuff that you guys are you know you guys are exploring with uh I Know it can be really dangerous I just wanted to share a little story of mine is really quick [noise] uh I ... truck driving right now but I I still do security from time to time\nOne of the places like the security with our cat was a um a building called the malls that building and here in downtown LA\nIt's pretty old building it's one of those buildings that kind of have stood the test of time you architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's definitely haunted I Know I I Am one night especially I was I was working we have these monitors that have cameras set up off the route every floor building and there's several floors dozens of Florida um\nAnd the monitors are set up to the motion sensor that so that every time somebody comes in or out as long as the cleaning lady or something like that the monitors will switch on and I\nHave you ever caught one on tape\nYou know what I mean shadows I've totally seen shatters I've seen and it always happens on the corner of your eyes how does this quake darkening\nYeah they do just like that but that would be great if you could get that caught on video\nIn an age of hackers and data miners are being more important to protect your personal information more you can with my the that the only way that you live on the way you do ... safely and didn't complete control nice you know combined secure communications with private browser virtual credit card orders I security features so you can start to shop\nFor life without compromising motor get out of south\nEmail for credit card to get used to do identity to stay safe secure and how\nThat mouse it as a last resort to get one year free\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe are back with Ron to collect Ken Maureen would our final segment here final calls more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a so everywhere Amazon and uh all the major bookstores\nAre still enough Maureen that our dear friend Jeff ... Roche you're a forward to the bar\nOr just a a yeah go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went in to go see a thing on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the site on it was goes village a since then we've become really good for\nTechnology continue\nDid you continue to make ghost haunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better better quicker than it does a lot of\nUm things out there some of them are really junk science but ah yeah I don't know I mean\nSpirited been around for you know hundreds and hundreds of years\nAnd ah they didn't have a water technical stuff back then yet people still had experiences though had great experiences and and seeing them and everything else I don't know we need to ... you know it reminds me of you know all the physical meaning ship stuff the weeds you boards\nAnd those were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people want to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic\nDevices doing this there are trying to get the ghost tend to to deal directly with her and not have to go to a meeting or not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but\nIt's yeah I mean there are there are some um\nBetter pieces equipment up there and there are some that that of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good risk I our camera a good record\nAnd Maureen how 'bout you will technology you change things\nOr you know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human beings you know then what we can sense ourselves on and we may be getting close with some areas that they're they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigate any types\nOr not [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nAll right let's go to a lot of calls here let's go to he seems Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there were done hurricane headed your way\nWe're on the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one\nOkay let's pray that everybody else is going on\nYeah I had a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida where you were at a a paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in St Augustine which is known to be haunted\nAnd while we were there a ghost um this was in the middle of the night that goes to actually made a table moved slightly up on the second floor\nSo we went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the ghettos and wife Susan and I and some other people that were there\nAnd we [noise] we had a a mini man flashlight on a table and the ghost could answer our questions by making the lights blink and uh so risky and various questions and to some guy\nTo indicate that its name was Murray and then it was a was had been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish\nPeriod and she's saying oh I just think\nEnd up at the time my auntie um I had a brief case with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year or so from time to time it would hear clicking noises that goes just teasing me that he was opening the briefcase\nI Love it now while I'm gone for the oil would happen is um if I drop like a little out of camp falls off a chair\nOr something I'm less last about a not last July but the one before that in the middle of the night having a little tiny bottle campers something fell off the side of the chair and\nOff the side of the chair and it's fun and like a high percentage speed for\nWhy are they mischief makers Ron ... what are they trying to accomplish my playing around like\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am here to pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to\nLet you know they're there and have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut ah I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I elected to my next door neighbor and ... and the next day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said here take it back she says we were reading the or the\nFirst chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shattering bucks who's doing the same thing to do anything really what they want to do I believe\n... tweets Tom what do you have a this woman from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to run or and Maureen can recommend ways to prevent ... from coming to a person's life ... into someone's why let's give that to you Maureen\nOkay so I don't even leave it to the rumbling [laughter]\nWe'll get home they really ...\nI'm honestly I'm a big believer with the with St Michael so I Know for me there's a few things one is intention if you you know you're looking for that and you're believing that evils coming into your life and you know it's very possible that your credit invited in\nOn the other thing is I print since I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up the actually she thinks spirits are ready\nUm so what we're doing is we had to St Michael's prayer card that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have different varying crystals around the room to how much energy\nOn and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's an belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you have to believe in yourself\nAs well on you can tend to have bought out bought out most times which you Ron what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurry came in your intentions sure\nMake good yeah so and tensions is a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion of course and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four\nDown to two don't do well and you know who's the sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what your word works\nYep crank Korea hundred percent with the judge sneak\nIn any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho ... west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead\nI'm Sorry to say first that are on I think we should all get centered in our heart and then ten to dissolve the circuit yeah I agree [noise]\n... ah question is probably more rain I have been serving the land for the last six years here I feel is time for me to go back to serving man\nOf attempted to move in April when I had a series of events that showed me there was a time yet so my question is would it'd be tough for me now to to move all\nDid you do a quick little reading here Maureen\nAny one moment okay well you're pulling out to lunch chat when you were on on this what's what are your next project Ron How often do you get called to investigate\nWell we had quite a few or you know I Would say you like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now and uh we only choose to once we really want to do basically uh uh\nYou get flooded with requests you know what\nWe do get a lot of them to be honest with you judge so uh yeah it ... you've got a screen 'em somehow so which is you know difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\n[laughter] All right so they'll actually public ... couple of cards and one was aspirations hang you know\n... to go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual card that says you know you need to be empowered to this um and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment as right\nTo actually make a change and it seems like it and working behind me off and kind of a nice I'm working really hard and it's time to kind of read some of those benefits and actually to look for when I'm obviously I Can't tell you what to do but\nI think that if you were to make a change now with the good", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "10"}
