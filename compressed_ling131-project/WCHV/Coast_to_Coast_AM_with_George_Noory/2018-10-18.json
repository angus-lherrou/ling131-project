I mean that the Saudis look you know there there are serious over their drug or repressive you notice about these these Middle Eastern countries there\nYard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans where they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we've probably at it and I think I was about a year ago so we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting up especially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you you've got an auction here and that is going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know at the end of the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of\nOr is that in nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nThat's been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy rates are there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans or and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nThought what if they did something like this that and they had a guarantee that a student\nIn ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available they get that discounted off their student loan that you know that was ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there [noise]\nUh but I can tell you what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day uh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution ... when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to\nSituation actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers\nAh so the ... you know they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan that's all they were going to take calls next hour with Alan in those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us or want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn alone and lots of the world that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them on a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nLots of defining hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the service or as the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than alone the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on into fall\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm\nCompelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make a three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can tell the bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... there's a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really what are your lungs have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nSnowy spleen to process all the defaulted alone in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows the thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure does it does a good case a good easy numbers to start with so many thousand lawsuit alone when the student graduates let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars [noise] what what penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty bucks in the lower is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will be\nThe escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive years in the lower is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what\n... what the Chinese system will do will say oh you're into fall on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed do stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the borrower\nSo ultimately they will wind guts um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those famous go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh eight\nThis rehabilitation and in the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well he's agents and get his sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that they compel them to do this on rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus he talks about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would or rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone that remains and just said and I should probably said here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these\nDefaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four oh and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nThat are often worse than the original disease or condition check out the cool articles videos Dr wallich and pharmacists been

critical Health News dot com human eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas Jefferson once said there are two ways the cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're gonna lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nIf they don't get the sun and then they become subject to arrest\nShow in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to ah to come into court that way to deal with their student loans\nAnd and and and forced to uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or primary process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy and literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interest in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat genetic version back again\nWell that's right you know uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war has raised an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying there's new loans\nThe whole fifty thousand now they want to pay them the let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these ... fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the ...\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that a default that\nLook kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place uh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan when it's a false is free unrealistic for most people [noise]\nUh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice taught orange so many years ago you know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this is the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly upstate here\nAre you seeing that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because defaulted loans\nYeah there is about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses a man across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired ah from this public employment on in the for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening\nYou can literally be fired ah from this public employment on in the for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a barn party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it but as President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it [noise]\nAbsolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really has only made the problem worse under Obama or Obama essentially federalized a lending programs so that we're before\nA bank such as was mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where do they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year which is more than any corporation on earth on blending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why the government property not student loans this is my own sense of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days\nI'm so unfortunately you know those ... Donald Trump's rhetoric was really good but since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy divide us\nWho are self had stock in going collection companies [noise] ah and you know I I frankly I don't think President Trump has really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Ninety Ninety eight you could file bankruptcy in white students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable [noise]\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed\nAlong is really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of cut this is a problem to Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is website is student loans justice dot org linked up and goes to goes damn dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of nationwide tour these days only what you doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code\nThat make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed a we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nUh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program a so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nGreen broke

okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally impact because it's not going to an arm of the state government college and were being offered tax that don't\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's not going to an arm of the state government college and were being offered tax\nThat don't know the role as a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and hear them saying okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only ... those things a little bit\nThe on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money or that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece remains loyal and Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of a large group and I hope I'm I he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much in\nThis and I I Know of the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total lettuce college debt and and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if you get rid of the lead and get a credit card\nOut okay with that loan but right um get a credit card it'll take the tax dollar and it'll save the state of college will drop like a rock and the look out my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide thoughts in hospitals and police\nLooking here it can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look if he can get bankruptcy repeatedly pre millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich bank in these colleges can get their written on the students looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary here and\nThen okay and they use these are All right we got your point there Gordy Allen\n[noise] you know I I got a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion her show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices back down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but in but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nLow you with all the debt right now Alan would you uh just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if you had a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge a subtle that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a non partisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there or able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum of the bankruptcy writes the founders demanded aren't return\nWhat would you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they're currently wrist\nYou suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they're currently receiving and she'll be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today\nSo I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\nSo yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFor some color mark in Provo, Utah Marco ahead\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they paid promote books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling\nSo I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that\nOh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon never pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark [noise]\nNo I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor in some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen yeah these these loans are\nOn the students way ahead of any scholarship for any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay it back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually out on the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program\nSo bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but\nWhat all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you\nWork for a you know if you work in a\nCollege or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left going far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount forgiven under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nBe our program and actually get loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that center the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals right probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not benign altruistic entity that is you know she can help us citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nGoing to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that are running the place now so\nUh they are no public a benefit a inspiration they get it and all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're going to come back and take funnel culture with you in just moment

from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices\nNot long afterward I decided to take a chance and with no experience in industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five

E. R. dot com\n[noise]\n\nAnd ... him back this is our final segment with Alan colon just we talk about the student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I think that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation\nA auto over you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nAh so certainly it's hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels\nIt was sort of a precedent type of debt I'm this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do I'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them and um\nYou get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them I'm graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those worked in that case who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given\nI uh got thirty four thousand thirty seven thousand but I got you know\nThat I owed forget wow how'd you do that graduations\nI received that thank you well I I did a little bit of our way um [noise] there's something called\nA the hills binding and what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a courses you cook or trade that trade show yeah and it is is ah\nIf they are of course uh the reason they're in the situation because they all by job quickly so if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school\nI'm pretty much that's when they committed a that brought\nSo it actually took me from I Would have to say December to dealt with it seemed to around August of two thousand and fixing to get a little given\nWhat I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email oh jeez privately responded um but that the avenue that I went to get all that ... had to write a cover letter M\nI submitted up pretty much over the cover that had to put money on that I had to pretty much just I'll put it all out there but I had gone through that does the transcript to a\nA cover letter transcripts there had\nPretty much all the information that I actually had the group that I went to college\nYou know what it was the fraud that they've done to reduce I guess right\nAh yes that's one of the main thing that book there because if you see many of the college commercials looking they promises life long drought waste so let's highlight false advertising\nYou have to exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your all in the ... there goes your your last night long outlets that got that right ah interesting Alan isn't it yeah that\nYou know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up as some other point of show there's or biking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... ... you then at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen this works successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were in light to buy you can only a for profit college\nOr you may may may possibly have some avenue for record\nWhereas before so if you're you were light to buy you clearly a for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWell you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credits and indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the new and they don't provide it to you there are a creek aren't\n[noise] well that's right and you know similarly per student loans we find a lot of private loans the underlying no uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned a note and they have no business collecting on that long I'm\n... now there are other there are some news that the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the new was lost and they have other avenues to prove that it is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of and I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have a statute of limitations so somebody comes up you Twenty years hands\nAnd starts demanding money from you for a private loan than\nAlmost certainly that alone is not\nLittle ... little suspect um and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up a lung\nGo to pat Minneapolis east of the Rockies Hi go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at least one of the agenda is is the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with signers\nGrandparents parents and still none of them are ever going to get any Social Security for an eye on a question and I think Jeff ... All right if if I own a house\nI call a fine on one of these student loans does it does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes into the loan first doesn't it\nWell that's a that's a great question um to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being tarnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now and I was in past yet by the legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in ... in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one other thing did your\nFamily is already where multi generation the grandparents and parents or their kid never going to get any thoughts that scary but my question is that if you have if you want to help with it and tear the LA you write a check to the school or a money order aura travelers jak or whatever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "18"}
