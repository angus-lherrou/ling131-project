Jewish ... I missed this as a\nMystical writings about the call them\nThe goal of them is in some ways and means by which the\nThe rabbi demonstrates their spiritual ask him and it's it's almost like a half to show that they are prepared for greater mystical and magical knowledge but the goal um itself is was understood by the rabbis to\nBe just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal and then the he says to them well what can I Do tend to speak\nAnd they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just\nIt's just the toy\n... ... which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures are writing and so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that\nThen we're just pretended to the throne as it were\n... what about the Sherman says well you know in Native American tradition and other types of was a cultures ... seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nThe sound and\n... light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states of consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism with spirit cabinet send the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet ...\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state of consciousness in the audience said so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be\nYeah so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in ... we want to invest in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced\nI think it's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... stick your experiences ...\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was\nYou know and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have a very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists to rationalize it\nAnd it's not that they were the monkey and because they wanted to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth this is true of Houdini Houdini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium or who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his dearly departed mother\nBut he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his\nBut he believed that it could be possible and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where let's just for a moment\nPretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves into\nThose are new Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right it's gonna be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had two days equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] navy but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you set of\n... you know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraptions in ... but we try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper goal his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House\nTo make it easier for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest to the super natural to stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions\nMore to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCoast insiders the new version of it goes to ... am at ... ... phone in now Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nPeter of all these incredible inventors and engineers and seekers who are temping attempting to get some kind of evidence about the existence of the other side\nWhat do you think drove them why would they so obsessed with trying to get these answers\nI think what Dr that quest is what Dr ... a very human quest to take control of our own spiritual\nMaterial destiny I mean it it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist wanted to go ... used to talk about you know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that have been about the Protestant American there it is something whereby we want to\nProve our rights and as we want to prove that we are loved by God by\nBy being successful in the world by being innovators inventor and entrepreneur is right and I think that that it stands even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something it's a very human I think typically American often and say you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existed and open it up and re purpose in it and so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people practice magic for millennium right\nIt's just another example of magic of a\nOf a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience\nDirectly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool like\nYou could we put you Peter in that category\nOf myself while I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\n... why does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[laughter] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it on the Internet is\nA ... you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we\nOnce used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce\nOur we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working with these themes considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular argue no mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that\nThese questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nGonna open up this radio when I'm when a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that even made this radio or something that you can find the store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits donate yet\nAnd yet we can take the things this technology and somehow the force it from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world that's underneath it and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences\nIn scientific understanding of the world it's underneath it and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there ... about how we can think about technologies in ways that the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter I hear voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirits and all these strange things he's out there he's out there\nAnd you of course who never had a radio you've never went online like to listen\nYou're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or what\nMy voice is out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right time to receiver\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when a spiritual is a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had\nStarted to develop had telegraph technology and people called the medium spiritual mediums\nSpiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this this new burgeoning technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit are and that the human being could also\nBe this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology tell me why\nWhile I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah\nAt the some of them is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company\nAnd they actually\nSaid this is how they advertise their television this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God so they and they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right\nUm and so the the fact that you know we that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate Jeffrey VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically\nIs is filled to the program right with these supernatural when I called metaphors and I think that that's really important I think you'd even when we talk about technology for not believers and and even if we're just using it we still use these this language to try to make sense of ...\nAnd I remember those days to dump put this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely\nMy dad had an old field goal radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was ... it was in case in this beautiful piece of wooden furniture and had\nAnd this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was and it was in case in this beautiful piece of wooden furniture and had silicone written across it uh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same with the TVs and in the stereo suddenly started coming out with\nIts right these are meant to be central pieces of our home right as they can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pulp that guy's comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists you\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live\nIn a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about this about technology is it I really believe that these ambiguous states are in chanting steak when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nI get into your time machine\nAnd tell me what you think things will be like\nA fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but that we

media was making this possible some record of all media whether it was a tape 'em or in this case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some

talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was the Hungarian born American illusion is than stumped performer noted for his sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S\nAnd that is Harry him ... on a tour of Europe or he challenged police forces to keep him locked up Sunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape Roman hold his breath and saw the shield\nMilk in the water in Nineteen oh for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups\nCommissioned by London's daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour and another ... buried alive only just able to claw himself to the surface are merging and the state of near breakdown\nNow what many suspected that these escapes were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge are fake spiritual as he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her he was not successful\nIs a website and he has some great information a bunch of doctors came in and\nUm they decided that who guinea a you know die from this punch\nA lot of doctors nowadays say he just died of ... from a ... ... so it's the battles rage on and on and what really killed him and it goes back and forth but I think he was had the onset of a appendicitis\nAnd that when he was hit it actually broke\nThe bus to train all the bacteria comes out and just ran through his body\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had stuck in seven days to die\nWho do you have one of the substances that what happened\nYes yeah it was a ... so it saps assault through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work during those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds\nOr since before Nineteen Thirteen they had this ...\nIt's a two way code that they'd worked out if one of them died that they would use this code ... ... attack each other\nAnd so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code\nAnd then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget the code what ah usually you know a a medium trans what happens\nIs Arthur forward with a ... medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory or you know the er which\nFrom rice and where will be watching like was he was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a ghost\nDo he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey alright he goes into the trench\nHe just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens\nAnd then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses and in one of them he contacted Houdini some other\nAbout a year before this and then he starts having these than says and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has Bible\nThan a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says\nBack to him uh-huh now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to about Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side ...\nOne word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but\nAgain it was sharper than who he said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code that she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five or ten French that she gets back the comeback to him so this was an ingenious code really because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wrong\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually or to even let everybody know what was going on\nAs well as you know Harry had to be first\nPerson had to escape\nRight here with us the sky apologist you had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane in Australia\nYesterday was that's true I heard\nHe had to be first it matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game\nSo uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career mogul yeah it had he survived she invented what they call now the dailies\nUh in in the movie industry he invented that it was rush cuts right\nYes so he was a you know\nAwesome and all these\nDifferent ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was going to\nDo and he was going to do and do you think it was successful\nI I Know ... I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nDidn't know that for a fact didn't comfort professor Bess his wife the\nBest was in tough shape should best was pretty depressed but you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some\nWhat I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and\nShe uh while he was alive in Africa and died while\nHe was alive and after he died\nAnd so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when a message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses\nNot only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was arrested in the stock market yeah for who\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending\nMoney like a girls on trees she just\nAnd I get Siri left are nice little sum home\nYeah he left her a part of the uh\nThey paid double\nN D empty or whatever for his insurance\nInsurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money to\nWrite a product that costs\nThe insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money to\nWrite a product that's close to a million dollars um\nThey doubled that because they said it with an accent because this guy punched mhm and so it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court\nSo she got fifty thousand or so she was rolling in do\nKnow and then she they put it all in a market and she lost at all now\nYou have heard of the curse that killed Houdini\nYes what is the correct\nNow Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was magic ... the second part was the ... gives you a scape he would do an escape that was where the water or the Chinese water torture cell or the uh the\nMilk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual less than he would have to have this um\nConfrontation with them punch the ups and\nSelf like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party you would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a a that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be fought on them and he'd go in and he'd find a couch\nOr something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark or sometimes see I found it I got to\nYou know and then they're probably attached to a string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the mediums would just what are what are you doing that I didn't have nothing to do with that\nWell they honestly didn't because I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call in out there's always a way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works\nAnd that's something the healthy switch to the next one and you switch to the next one ... and and at work\nSo you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in his escapes of course I'm not guaranteed got two or three keys in there you know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T best would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate key in her mouth\nAnd just split it into his mouth exactly how\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was exactly the same thing for the spiritual\nSpiritual is because he had an agent and she would go into the town and she would find some low hanging fruit she would ah find some of mediums that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't\nFind what they're doing ranch couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch and so later who gaining he had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere put the curse on it\nRight so\nHe did this with Marjorie ah he Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor we're we're in a break but we'll come right back and talk about the curse that killed who do you\nHi I'm ...

E. R. dot com\n\nOkay welcome back to coast to coast professors slim king with us as we talk about the life of peer review Deanie we'll also talk about magic very shortly as well professor back to the curse you were talking about the Marjorie and Houdini and explain a little bit more about who Marjorie was\nOK I'm Marjory his real name is Nina ... and and she was a socialite in Boston she was married to a doctor\nAnd they had kind of a mysterious life she uh was set to be really really a sensuous\nLady uh all the pictures I see she looks pretty average but everybody who met her I thought she was just devastatingly beautiful I don't know why but they did uh and uh it had probably had something to do with the way that she did per se on ... a mean it\nWas that they called her Marjorie and she was the which appliance street sometimes they called her the blonde which of Boston\nAnd that wasn't a complement and those days to call somebody you're which I think so I think it [laughter]\nI think they uh they got a big kick out of it because I I it was a a lotta people during that time period during the spiritual this movement\nUm a lot of people were having families circles they were all kinds of people that were Catholics are Baptists or whatever on their on their Sunday afternoon or a Saturday they would all get together in the middle of the day and hold hands and somebody would go into a trance and they would try to contact their\nThe feast relatives it was a common back in the twenties\nOkay but this this curse now\nRight so a Henry does and he's going to check out mean a ... and he's going to go to Boston and they line up about six fan says that he's going to attend\nNow the Scientific American have a twenty five hundred dollar per se por anybody that can prove that they are a real medium\nEarning her normal and\nA kind of like the J. R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never had to give out\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] um well they're all like you for that one\nYeah a while they can they can just like me all they want I don't think they play fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want\nA that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead so anyway the ah\nThe Scientific American have the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to a Marjory say on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em was Mac and ... that's the agent that easily sent to head what he does he builds box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box and he has um James Collins building forum and he builds all of a Houdini props\nThis box and he has um James Collins build it for him and he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get anything so who d'nese going to make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they ah do once they aren't in everything goes according to plan and\nAh they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box and if they push on the ... the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now ah and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first chance the bell rings\nSo the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it and they put ... and the second say on the bell rings\nSo now he's\nSo now he's got a picture and remember we talked about before about there's always a now you have to he has to\nFix marching ... Marjorie because these are actually already written a book about her how he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out so he has to expose her so she comes in uh everybody gets around the ...\nAnd of course Marjorie has a spirit guide\nAnd his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother so Walter ... she goes into a ... and ... comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why do you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nConditions every new scissors and this was the spirit saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie\nAnd the ... puts a death occurs because inside the box is a ruler one of those rulers pulls up into three pieces yup\nIn one of those all kinds of this and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini while and a\nJames calling how soon ... was the curse a professor and then Houdini ended up dying\nWell the ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that's\nYou know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally that this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\n... does it scare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd could die at any moment\nYeah and you really have to you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy\nRight that they have prophesied that he's gonna die\nSo later when Houdini gets sick\nMaybe this is in the back of his mind\nAnd so he doesn't go to the doctor\nBecause he doesn't he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my\nViewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to him was that\nArthur for\nThe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur forward what happened to him was that\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or\nDid he outlive Houdini\nHe outlive all a few lived until Seventy one oh wow okay harbor poured\nLived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini or tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the\nTable ... and then he had some drawings made her leg is reaching around his leg\nSo he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like the drawing\nA little little trickery by Houdini\nYes Houdini once again is doing this and um\nThere was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one a expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with down injure and then he worked with ... and he makes a statement that there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting\nAnd he gives this quote buy gifts and it says when will magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the mediums he purported to expose wow\nThat's pretty heavy ...\nThat is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ... James Collins in there and that uh\nThe roads Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done professor if they had television in those days or\nWhy this election day Fox anchors won't talk about exit polls it's now the Fox news butter analysis and it covers voting in all states whether in person or by mail I'm Dina plant and that's your whole parade\nIs coming right now we're getting into the big wave a fabulous fall events come into your flu county library due to in friday morning story time for the little ones free movies of all kinds of every Friday for the kids\nEven no schools today movies the moonlight madness and we're reading programs for kids teens adults who prizes too can go now of\nCourse we'll get down to write on over to your fabulous Susanna county\nTo county book sales so\nThe it's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ...\nSeven five and am twelve sixteen you don't have\nGood morning I'm Brian doubt with WC age the local news first your top story agriculture\nIs Virginia's largest private industry at the U.S department of agriculture has announced more than half a million dollars in grad funding is being awarded to promote specialty crops and increased economic development and Virginia\nPotential recipient projects include one to expand the use of Mason bees as pollinators and another to research and develop ways to optimize maple syrup production capacity other specialty crop grants went to broccoli sweet corn honey tree fruits\nMelons and strawberries on Monday afternoon US Navy captain and NASA astronaut Scott tangle appear to UVA school of medicine to share his experiences as flight engineer on an expedition to the international space station\nSingle was launched into space on December Seventy two thousand Seventeen for close to a six month stay at the space station conducting hundreds of experiments some focused on advancing medicine\nSo the experiments I participated in were one of them was metabolic tracking and if it works then we can limit the want to get through Europe original trials on people to just two or three weeks four weeks much shorter time\nDespite the challenges single said the motto he likes to live by is work hard have\nFun and dream bake Charlottesville area transit has announced that voters eating a ride to the polls next week and get a\nFree ride on several cat bus routes\nAccording to release cat will offer free rides their area residents to and from\nTheir polling locations including alumni hold you for middle school to cover and key rec centers Clark Johnson and Walker upper elementary schools while there are no direct cat ... elementary school ... university transit service does have two groups that do close the outer loop and enter loop bus routes both\nStop at fourteenth and working on streets cat\nWill also offer services through a number of polling locations in album Raul county for more information and ... match called cat customer service at for three\nFour nine seven zero three six for nine this has been your WC age the local news first I'm Brian doubt Fox News and you're CBS Nineteen whether authority forecast our next conceivable one seven five and twelve sixty WC H.

he was in town before he died was he not professor\nYeah I think I think that was one of his one of his escape\nYeah it really was they dumped them in the Detroit River I think he was in a straight jacket upside down\nOut that he loved doing that and sometimes he was in a box\nHoudini would he would\nModify his escapes to whatever of\nYou know kind of businesses that wanted to support him so uh you know if the police supported him he'd a scape from one of their jail cells or a there was one tiny escape from a a like big fish they built a big fish 'cause there was a fish company that was

Copperfield to I assume he has people on staff like you are right exactly\nExactly um\nJames Collins was the guy that Houdini the built in all of them for them but Houdini would say I want to do this\nAnd then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the HIPAA Jerome they walked in Alison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then the shrouded or cloaked it or something and then the trick began a ... it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\nFor a while he probably the same queen that's there in Europe but I don't think she was that there are\n... okay I I don't know for sure the next on it I don't think she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\n... let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis site where else go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away readings\nA New Yorker for oil and his last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died ...\nSeeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found them question for you or what we what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs who Danny this was in Nineteen twenty nine\nOkay with a three part code by the code was the middle section and the first word was Rosa dollar rows\nAnd then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe and then she had dry words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his code I'd gotten through\nNow didn't he she later denied that later on you\nAfter she loses her friends she loses all her money a man called Edward Said\nComes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nAnd she fell in love again yeah so\nHe didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she went in the same kind of way that you had to engineer's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... promises to her\nThat ... make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead room\nA wet year than they cheat deny that the the code was correct ... well the first time she never denies the code was correct uh she says that she was full\nBut she never denies that the code was correct but she\nThat's correct uh she says that she was told\nThat she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages she having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she's she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he saver from the depression\nSo she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math depression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with there every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh Arthur Ford was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know\nShowing her this pleasure for that than Edward St comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket cheers\nHe made a ... a couple of movies at least ... ...\nWell Houdini made four or five Bobby\nYeah but they also all they do they do well\nOr they did fine but he was he was the star of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThat they he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking co star\n... his real name Eric Weiss yes\nHe was he was a pretty good looking guy to\nBe a kind of a sudden my guy he was only a and\nEverything kind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a a compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes in all the movies\nReal name Eric white some ... I guess\nAn ax Eric turned into Harry and then Houdini he got from who Don and he added and I called it Houdini and er so to this day they called him Harry Houdini\nBut I don't think he ever\nA switch his name and he was born in uh Europe you know he wasn't born here and he was\nHe was born in Hungary\nYeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't\nEven actually\nI'm a U.S citizen if you\nThink wasn't there a magician named Blackstone ... did he come after hearing\nA blacks almost after Harry yeah\nOkay I guess he was pretty good too was ... he was great\nHe was great or there was with him and his son also there was a junior\nHas has a techno who's who's the artist who\n...
