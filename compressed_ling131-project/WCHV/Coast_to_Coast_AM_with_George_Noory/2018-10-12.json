they've been using for years they've they've had seven hundred and forty five flights they had Twenty one failures that doesn't seem like much but it's three percent and you know you're flying out\nOf the international space station at three percent fail you around your boosters is a is not acceptable because it I mean most of the time you do not recovered the crew most of the time of year like

said they call that I I think it kind of our version is that I mean I don't I don't know what else are you and they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it seems\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct is much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're well what did the indicators market the last two days is really taking it on the ... the concept is just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds shoot\nUp I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen and we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating in a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a down turn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and it's been waiting to go back and we said look it breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first black these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy would tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes gross to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do\nPlus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes gross to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose one happening like ... we had a couple more D's downturns tomorrow's another five hundred point drop then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we're we're just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we had a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling ensuring the market it happens very quickly\nYou'll see you know I've seen this the last seven stock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash in every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two\nAnd a half months when people get whacked and that's\nThe sign that that's the only way you know the the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so we did the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the Dow if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty were fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous\nUm uh you know the Rothschild guy ... Ross trial once you know when somebody asked what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that level to this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nCorrection a nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this this is a once in a ...\nHalf the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the science to me are building we'd been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden and top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year that we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] what will this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like\nWent sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred and ... trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world [noise]\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is flowing and and like I said they have the biggest debt bubble of anybody in any time in history when China blows a weird we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the tub backup with money that was draining this time more debt everything's\nMore stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\nSe she was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back here he is dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff syllable lifetime and zero\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to ... with the cherry so if we have quality companies that have solid earnings and they've got money in the bank their stocks could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\nRight again well any time you get a major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions a bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company to survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years the bill but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times\nKind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not end well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued and above all like this but they're also go down I mean General Motors in Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down\nYou get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flap instead of declining\nThe valuations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock for an hour forty\nIn in sixty or eighty for the best taxed on those collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of the danger is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know how it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's not a secret well I Know I Know believe\nMe Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there the ones to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are over bought in stocks or about they're the ones that short first I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action whether there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's going to open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour end of the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crack now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that has been a strong\nWarning signal to me in in recent months into our subscribers are you in Puerto Rico on them I Am in\nPuerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable uh to watch everything\nI mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico\nA temper tantrum don't you moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ... to islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there and and I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming in I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality and\nA quarter of the price of South Beach Miami where we're used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport\nWhich I get to twenty minutes in advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt\nBelow al I'm not sure I liked that part\nWell it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing in landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realize I I could qualify for some tax advantages here which\nAre very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto geyser coming down here because of that and businesses that can qualified

Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and ... down here and I actually love the banks are by banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people either just because they think\nWe're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nMy name's boom in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to ...\nThat's where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they ended up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people ... why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and the U.S\nIs better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always ... best people and again it it's

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight\nNear the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans you wrote in a democratic\nBig deal ... ... what what was his point\nWhile he well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling ya in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting devote all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republicans and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate they're both courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election\nAnd they didn't use in that one democratic ... isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nYes my question George and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidized they're red states and the and the state that receives the most was Kentucky with an idiot McConnell with the stresses me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us an SOS the mid west\nNot far I'm for your guest\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying as as a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying ... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement for like thirty five years almost forty years are entity which is nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost obliterated yeah we have a meeting with thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks or entity\nAnd I don't trust any body on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and Franklin Roosevelt should should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what do we ask our financial\nPeople who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to anticipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nPeople people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYeah you know real quick they these two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nOr corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock the evidence but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down in interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stocks the worst place to be for a pension plan is\nTo do what everybody's that run into stocks and collapse and you're also write about blue states subsidizing read that's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that\nSucceed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union it'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in the whole EU California he Tom go\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research and really appreciated um [noise] I mean you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions\nAgainst war and\nYou could argue that\nThe world today in San Antonio\nThird world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and one global corporations cannot compromise their\nDifferences in the global boardrooms there was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea Vietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean\nA limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states into a third world country in\nA day or two you know with a electromagnetic pulse cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan [noise]\nUm but but what we're saying and zero hour we we traced global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in the world war one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty per se\nGlobal trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising terrorists like we're seeing now everything's happening like happened that this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose [noise]\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stuck there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that can really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds ... Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing powers have how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and\nEven much says check on the on line for me to find enough and\nEveryday fades dot com mental thing means\nEverything off I couldn't supply\n...

calls here Harry thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\nYup love the richer people George ... people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market at the new secular it has to do with the ...\nAnd I happened to get in and mid July just before the infusion and the canopy growth but the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value from about fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is what you um what this kind of been offered a little bit particularly and kill the uh election this November because there are several states that are looking you that have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that that now because of this age you're of a what you're talking about taking place\nOr you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chanting crypto currency are but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly\nWhen we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most cars they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best\nTed but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most cars they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop and yes I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term social political Trent it's gonna go in that direction although there may be some backlash and the downturn just because\nPeople get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good soccer but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper\nUm utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn and and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything\nAny major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nYeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then\nThen go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out of you know what you owe you how do you know when the boss back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at pass corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets\n... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the ...\nEighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range\nIs Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now if that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started buying even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and these sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get\nTo buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but\nRanch cites a Republican yup okay for them\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but\nStates are Republican you're okay but those days are Democrat Democrat I missed then did you not say earner or did I misunderstand you that you said the south was ran during the civil\nWar yes they they would have been they would have been more even though\nYou know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and helped get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so\nYou the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but that all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats it it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east\nAnd that's another trend we can clearly show to cycle so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where economists get it wrong commerce think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top now or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never hundred when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and it scares that was not a gas that science of when

I was just thinking about you right that's very common um\nAnd I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nYeah that's true someone who say let's say well my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah I in fact I had a great a great aunt had an experience where she\nFell asleep and she will cop and she said have rather had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards she found out yeah so but he died while though yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do\n[noise] but you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women and I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these psychic experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\nI Would say both\nI Would say that there's a sort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences that protest in the brain\nSo for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and that

woke up again in this time I was ...\nGood my mother's a George you don't go to bed and I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Mandy what a ... at that point it lamb ... back into my body I woke up was jarred\nAmong eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later she stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found\nA book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also it was it ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just found myself voting on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and notify the experience has there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Robert Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on like trickle stimulation on the right tempo cortex he was able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the van that tells me that the that ... will protests yet of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward\nUm they were in complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has affecting your medical student I dreamt of us ... exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam is the same as the first question in my dream ...\nYou have the answer that you knew exactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with some time off a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomenon told me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experience as well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... I mean beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nSo parent normal means beside normal it doesn't mean have normal and there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I get\nI'd normally doesn't mean abnormal and there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk film where people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyway\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things\nAnd that was really what motivated me to read the\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ...\nNo I'm not familiar with him or her oh her in a it was my aunt\nAnd she she went to a Oxford University by and she got her degree in psychiatry yet and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy\nAnd that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity or but she was convinced totally convinced that\nThe ... the was the real deal and the and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\nOh well I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very ... you know\nBreakthrough to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're in on\nWritten by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander those who have and yeah\nAnd his nearest surgeon and marry the Neal she loved to have an end back to the north and the the surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in Iraq just to go to the cause of the nation so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another attack as to who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that I mean she she just did the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in their own oh I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show no you that's terrible it was just ...\nHow did you get so interested in philosophy\nShe just always wires and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my ... medical center in New York where they were studying deemed to like the the\nAbility to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to any teeth I'm the AG could measure what we call him sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... gene state the San Diego but given event and images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to to let the when the state and it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they were under hypnosis so there are ways to augment fuzzy but\nIn my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with more Dr ... is with us his book the borders of norm [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize is paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe they're extremely common don't you\nThat's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nI'm actually happened to my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she's out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospital with dying patients and they've\nOh there's someone something you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death these visitors became more frequent\nAnd these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed visions are very common now one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying\nPatients saw and that's interesting because\nYou know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brains they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it but at the visions are shared\nThan those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction to their brains\nAnd they weren't on medication so\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWhen Steve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many that he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow\nNow what do you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know\nI'm a a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that would be no skeptics of course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ... how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the these patients who who died in ... Eighteen percent of them had a new report in the near death experience\nBut does that experience is due to the lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain not just as a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be being reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication\nVersus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't talking medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so um\nWho weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise] um people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical but it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked to him on on your deathbed the vision that they sometimes she a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician mouth and Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported seeing angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and\nDid anybody else you\nKnow so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me\nAnd I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition to the next level of the next world and they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but\nThat's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDo they see you I don't think so okay I don't think they were there for me I think there were there for my father right\nSo they didn't acknowledge you\nKnow you know you saw that\n... that's right now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions you know um\nIf they were produced by certain chemicals\nThen live with the um visitors only ... the people who were seized why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of deceased people there the person who is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... all one rather died and the other brother was near death so the the brother that was near death\nHad a vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that rather was dead and they'd rather cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre ... do the dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive games I mentioned one above the very powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know if it is a cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream because often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they've tried to process things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talked about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had the dream that he was murdered [noise] now we could say that that was a peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dreams maybe he was worried that someone was going to\nYou could say that that was the peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him [noise]\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to ... you saw standing by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard of that too yeah yeah so that could have been a ... carton intervene but another famous person who\nReported a prescribed interview with Charles Dickens really I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put out a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give a reading into a new\nTown where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself\nTo her with forwards she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid I'm often when we wake up in the morning or dream start to fade but the cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail\nSo the next day he went to give us reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... Napier so so this stream was pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or\nOr how to explain it but he he ... he had that the cognitive dream so I'm In some people for example Larry ... is a person has written about yes ... century cognitive beams and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into ... or not\nWith your schedule green broke welcomes all insurance to see if tennis therapy is right for you or a loved one visit Greenberg PMS dot com that's green Brooke T.

path but no I have not and that's very troubling\nOkay well in terms of your question uh George what causes that well I guess I Would call that a a pre cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know and I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could see on one level we're all connected\n\nAnd somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware

it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you lay back and let them try to come to you\nDeceased loved one is it easier to be\nA little more aggressive just trying

find different lectures and things about that and over the years time\nThis book written by a BYU religion and how often the professor\nAnd over the years I was just listening to coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps to give some understanding about this of of the eternal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick [noise] I'm a ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by\nA listener on the coast to coast a lot about death experiences to friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other in about twenty five days after the second one\nI had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as for

... with a deathbed ... or ... of the the loved ones that are also very I'm In\nThe death bed divisions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because\nI'd like to look at it from the point of view of the body and mind the most ally ... spiritual life so I can get for different components in each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\nA good question because so many\nBeen for you the most dramatic piece you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them I mean there's there's cases have ... people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win lotteries\nWow you know I'm I don't do those kind of dreams\nNo me neither but that's been verified [noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition [noise] mhm\n[noise] if you look at the Bible they certainly lots of biblical profits like Daniel and as the ... or if example Joseph you know who had the cognitive dreams are prophetic dreams you might say and even in the history of the church people like St Francis if a CC or Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when John was Thirteen Years old she said she saw lining white light and you heard of voice which he identified as the arcane journal Michael coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been documented by many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so\nI think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works man it's it's you know let's call it the gods factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why did the were the first place what do you think\n[noise] the ... the first thing that came to my mind is it's out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt gives us a different level or a different dimension to our lives and then somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls for you we will be un by going to Joe in Long Island New York to Joseph go ahead\nYeah Hi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the dreams\nAre interestingly I had to dreams recently that began with a preference\nOf the day it's set of October first and I ended up at the beach I go on the water to Little Rock but this other people's while they're young and it's um usually warm which would be the case had I Want but I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same day\nIn real life so my question would be with your dream about the test\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise]\nAh so I ask you about that you know what do you think and the case that trains are going to a really acting in your favor number one and then if the dream is\nNot quite calling and what and you're thinking could that be aspects that are still really current and have current applications that you could cherry pick and how would you do that well\nOf all your first question how did you notice the demons acting in your favor well I'd say is is the content of the dream a warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is telling you about something that's coming up for you and your life or is it about another person so I'd say\nIt's acting in your favor first of all if it's about you not about another person\nAnd if it's and they the action is beneficial\nIt's acting in your favor first of all if it's about you not about another person\nAnd if it's and if the action is beneficial now in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because they can be some super fluid sort of extraneous materials in the dream that's not necessarily related to the main point of the dream\nSo I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied to in which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nSo now to Joe yeah that's that was good yeah okay\nGood next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west of the Rockies Mary going in\nHigh school stuff there also her home because I won't right on Wall dream stay he's talking about my father is the most\nProminent before he died a week before he died I tell people my father walked up to death and shook his hand and went with it I'm Serious a week before he died he was talking to people he was just so happy he had been sick\nHe wouldn't tell us why you sit and read before he passed the cold the neighbors are you ready to die\nAnd she was shocked she says oh I don't think about that and do away and then he was just\nUnusually tapping the and the night he passed it was three in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning and I was so sleepy and he said\nOh my brothers and sisters and I knew most of his brothers and sisters were dead they're out on the porch there waiting for me and he said I'm going with so and I was so he said look a little kid to seal I look out the screen I didn't see anything and oh so he uh\nI went back to sleep because that was so sleepy three in the morning he evidently laugh I Know it's we woke up the next morning and my mother's like have you guys see your dad and I told her I said mom\nHe told me last night he was going with his brothers and sisters and she was way shocked she knew\nThe ramifications but I get you know and my dad I think he was part native or something but he always told me he should win\nOlder people in the native culture get old you said they go out in the woods or somewhere and they die I've heard some people don't Alaska get in a kayak it does go out in you know the water and that's\nThe way he did he want 'em to the area that used to be an Indian burial ground area and they found him like two weeks later\nAnd I think for many years\nIn the south some people are really spooky and if you die in a home it likes brain that stuff to it or he didn't want to fight and the kids I think that's I think we're kind of had us find I don't know but he knew he looked diet and when they found that he did not look like he was struggling they said it looked like he did that when we're on just path", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "12"}
