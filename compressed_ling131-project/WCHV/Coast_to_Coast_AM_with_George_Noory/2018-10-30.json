weren't born they don't exist\nKnow they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is it the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was a\nAn opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd and everyone was there see it at a church and was there Hilton was there like Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the ... the industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now an end of the\n... you know come on marketing ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why\nA ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making your room smaller and your lobbies bigger you know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\n[laughter] yeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up\nAnd asked me what was going on with their market but you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off this was Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd I and I said I'm\n... so your your sales are are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues is that the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said a Hoosier customer\nAnd they have an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he's over ... they don't fit in the product anymore I said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said black baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen\nSixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nThere was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd I said ... years and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nThey said what does that mean and actually what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to\nTwo and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from it came from people help people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nIt look at those trends you find out that you know if there were kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs you're too smart [laughter] All right but but you did that doesn't that sound like like ...\nThey go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs you're too smart [laughter] All right but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common ... said that\nYou know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers for everybody to see that the boomers all sat down and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\n... and ... and another large groups it's out of ... and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy ...\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed\nYeah what's happening with you there what's happening in the like companies like McDonald's or they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something sledding\nBut I Know you don't want to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off you know they're there and all of their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years as I said you you ought to three ends up of a food it's called\nNutrition nutrition nutrition and what is McDonald's famous for its not nutrition you know it's it's for French fries\nGarden list of what they try to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional foods\nExec like correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nA ... in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell the food\nYou can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts [laughter]\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\n... yeah well you know it it's funny you say that's\nIn Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in\nTwo thousand five and they will they will be [noise] uh but\nThey will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully

I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the er the let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then the the um [noise]\n... um the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of STDs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this\nOther group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation X phi Katie for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop I you know\nKids are age and she calls herself are cute but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to ... and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it is funny because I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics are born\nOutside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a number of marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture a where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the\nMarriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that\nHow much can you affect change\nWell you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of\nChanging what the culture is doing I think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh\nYou know you go back to forty years and you you you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened\nAnd you you you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened\nThey grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the issue of sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the the boomer hippies lip became Republicans\n... ...\n... ... in all cases [laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look\nAt [noise] [noise] I did this this is you know let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] uh between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here they were there were only about\nSixty nine million people born between sixty five or ... eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million bond between forty five or sixty four what does that mean that means that that that particular population could not\nSupport the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like\nLike a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we\nAre as a nation that has a small indigenous population of superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... were the with the you know our our strength should be in our population\nIt's actually smaller than the net result is a you know ... ... it's kind of having a\n... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a\nCushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born we're losing a cushion [noise]\nYeah well what we did in ... as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age\nAnd and I'm and\nA middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if if you're middle ages small\nThen then you're middle income as small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got\nThe billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially when I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year\nOr if we're converting these in the cells because the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\nA Facebook has kind of a strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product um as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry or\nThe Internet are uh advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go

don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative to them is\nInvolved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I

going to take your calls and your stories as well as more is when we come back that coast to coast that yeah [noise]\n... one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed\nIt was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off to bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and ah I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I had to go get something you know some water or something and then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating\nLike there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving there was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's a at my wife at the time or her hand mirror a clock\nAnd a few other little items that were on the night stamper vibrating in some of them fell off and I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this bar\nAnd there was a Green Belt and then there was another apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex and I looked directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the owning singer I Hope you know not only will just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped\nSo I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tele kinetic powers because it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved\nWhat reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tele kinetic powers because it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there that the\nThe item stopped and I got you know and I didn't have that feeling of somebody pulling me off to bed so it would that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that and\nI'm putting in Bruce that when you went through that red light and you made it through a live loser reason you're still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago with my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time\nIt was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come a and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said\nUh is that I I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that ... you know I I think the fact that I have all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does\nKind of you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but I you know I don't know but I I I Do know that I Do have\nThis mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out you know in in our\n... you know very chronically under funded because there's you know it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this the spiritual world works and it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do I I Am able to to to do it\nAnd I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me I don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow human beings and it provides them with\nComfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there in in ... and there are some real people that do for a living\nI don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed that when\nPeople say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that\nThey can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on in in there is a a a connection being made\nA ... and uh so I I I ... that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd ah there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often and uh and connect with them and and\nThe things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel that I have to do\nIt I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the ...\nPeople and I and I I feel that I have to do it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kinda like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written I felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled\nTo do it I have to do it and I'm more than happy to\n... to ... to ... to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with value waited for is Bruce up it's just a question then take it away to him as a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accidents in the intersection and job\nComment question or comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear and\nChristianity and Islam Hindu was some Buddhist some Taoism and and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supple light whatever my question to you know\nSet you metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nHow can the average man the average woman\nCultivate a few well close\nPersonal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that ... everybody has these abilities are often ... the light lie dormant sure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know\nPretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation I just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut off\nSo things kept happening but now I've I've learned to through meditation or what I call walking meditation all explain it I I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I\nI go on a walk in and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state and at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer\nA and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people are practicing a you know professional mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know um and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have and uh and and to help\nPeople if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is and I I Would say just ...\nFoot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifled but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and what my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class is to have what they call focused calm\nFor meditation and what my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class is to have what they call focused calm to be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be\nYou know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany\nOr are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not it'll it'll keep building day by day\nAnd before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens you'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce ... go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life\nLifetime journey and and everybody had their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say you know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been taking care of

I came on the air adopted Julie\nYes and so on the email is\nStill there um hopefully you'll get to what sometimes when you're putting in fact for the local media was okay\nI'm ...

I Would check the outlets to see if there was short so any where my sister and I\nAnd there's a lot I actually have two of the recording with a father ... problems if he likes to park\nIt's it's really bizarre I ... I Can't explain it\nBruce what about you what do you think about ... BP's\nWell uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I think\nThat they can be very helpfully because the ... the folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones uh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh\nItems will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign that that they're there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is\nWhat I encountered when I Do the walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kind of sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut are often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about\nThem anymore and what do you mean by it could be said\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I sensed in him and sadness and kind of ... like he had regrets and I said ah I sense that is that something you'd like to share\nWith me why you feel that way and he he said well\nNo and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "30"}
