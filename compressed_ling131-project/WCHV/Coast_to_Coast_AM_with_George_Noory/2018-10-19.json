been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the medium ship hard to say medium ship part ... where people are healed\nWhen they receive messages and their loved ones and they realize that those people are not really just dead or fixed or whatever they may be thinking because really\nI Love church and religious organizations but they don't do it with a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well so I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over you shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy the hill and wellness with them so\nThat that's really important for medium ship brings in that ability to let people know that their loved ones are doing fine\nDoes the spirit never come to you and say the monies in the bag on the shoe box\nSure they do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and spirit or if you're out before you go for this applies to everyone before you go to sleep at night you ask say please tell me if you continue to ask where is it\nUsually you get an answer if you ask me maybe three times four times you get an answer just it really hang in there with it and be diligent in your request\nKeep asking we were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or they're just been given to you\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures here we've had a camera eye to eye on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of very photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of weird things going on and it's so interesting George maybe can tell me that the reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference do you think\nIt is and why where this comes out on film but it doesn't come out with just the human eye staying at a wife has such a difference do you think\nThere is a huge difference and it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up goes or just about everything that you can't see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to just see things in a certain level a word that camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right it's so odd and it was a cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would would a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirit has not tell me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photographers scientific photography has the ability at the eyes just not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far\nIs not good\nYou know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is to train the deceased person somebody\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing for our skin tests the spirits you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone's saying before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is can come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that they will not get past that barrier\nAnd if you're religious you could say the name of Jesus Christ of whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board\nNo and I know your feelings about to reach abroad and I agree with you I have a picture in my seven steps to having book about\nMy ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young teens ah\nAnd my brother that we're using a way to broaden my living room and I was sitting on the couch watching them and we were all very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside\nA demon face oh really that's in my book seven steps\n... to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety two fifty seven bridge got a birthday coming up\nI grabbed out a way Hey Greg pointed to test your ability because over the past few decades have met the psychics and maybe a handful\nOf actually came up with predictions by saying like a you know what what's the Toyota Corolla doing around [laughter] that's how I got there and all this but the the others have worked off of the ... thing oh you should be speaker and this and that so that's\nHow I should be anything but I'm telling you to death I Will say one thing about you [noise]\nUh you have at the time of your breath you had more as a sign of a Scorpio so you love secrets\nAnd you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the solving mysteries I Will say that to you and you know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you get answers and true so great to somebody I can do for you\nYeah I'm Wondering if you see predicting wise or something coming up for me career or my income wise change or to make it better [laughter]\nWell you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detected work\nAnd so that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detective work anything like that\nNo I just watch a lot of these uh\nGame shows where you're going to guess the words [laughter] oh that's a good start well I just starting a new career\nAnd that really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance or independent contract work with a you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you as if you want to find out what's really assault purpose and I feel that it's discovering mysteries you should really follow it along those lines out just kind of a study forensics for bed\nAnd when you're not doing construction and you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain it's it's really exciting [noise] you're an honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field and honest so thank you for saying that gray\nGray coat everything works out for you speaking of honesty Joyce you see something bad will you tell that person\nHas to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bad like\nMainly like it down now shining accident in action and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid it\nYes I had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen guy\nTold me not to go out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but someone came along and said no no we have to go to the beach we have to do this and I had to really horrendous accident so guides will tell you and if you're not told and you have the accident anyway that it's supposed to happen like you charge I don't believe in accidents\nNo and you know when you look back at the movie the Christmas carol ... looking in the window with the ghost of the future says spirit or these things that will be or could be and that's a that's an interesting question do you think we have the ability to change our destiny\nI think as you raise your consciousness and grow and are aware of this and you grow in truth and love and light and understanding you absolutely can't and that's why we're here with the it's a school this is one big school charging you know it\nAnd a chair for lessons you too well you know you don't have to experience something really nasty can bypass it\nLet's go to bowl in Wichita, Kansas ...

bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it we let ourselves to rush style to sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs don't deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to back on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and said no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dream because we think that our dreams are giving us a little ring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right girl of the right guy and sometimes strangely kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic dream stays\nWhat we would like to see in our waking life these are some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the simple suggestion that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake the world around you will speak the language of science and symbols and good is if you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert\nTo the pop up so the pop ups in waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you had some stories directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream as coming again and again and as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same as saying dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's\nYou know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation and trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on they've tried to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I it might of the stories I I picked a sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked\nHow I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if\nThey had to keep on making the same time but just in not getting the message of not taking action from it\nThat's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box\nWe do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe it very strange women who sat down next to me and the plain old reality and mentioned me at a certain point that a dead house than to the ... he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn the news that he creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects [laughter] the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might you the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you've become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self maybe a site they why is there and fight the highest self\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you\nIs not alien to is not hostile to you and is probably being run by someone with a slight why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock us awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current understanding the understanding I mean the really ready to revive quite ancient understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells a science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with a ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discovered that we have ... doorway into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information my getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical you can do dreaming basement beans use at an intention to get\nFor more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this they simply practical you can do dreaming ... beans use at an intention to get guidance on anything that interest even probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to list the dream on that subject as well because he's got some grass nearby to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history a lot of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of ... narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology in the aughts\nEven in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can\nTake us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it it can take us into the off the lights the UCs the hand walked the job opportunities some living environment a like\nA beyond death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the ... the other venture killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show

life they can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know for certain show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death and page will load accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file\nOn the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship\nWith the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we leading a power live this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power lines\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time will\nBe guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in ... places to a part of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly

twenty fifth publish the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\n[laughter] a short of that that's still pretty\nProlific no good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them in dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAnd you just listed some really interesting areas for example in terms of the health I mean one of the things going on in dreams is that that body talk as well as sold to another words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center the idea is that a dream my gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms\nBut that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay relevant ended with acting up on those dreams and try and bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were you know till after the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or\nBy common colds or whatever I'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dreams\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal they're not supernatural but that beyond the normal I'm Talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to have to see things the distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things dreams will deliver them if you can't find a solution to problem ordinary life\nPut the question to your dreams and see what comes and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for the U.S not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence gold is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a thought or preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver an incident or citing\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is put your question to the world go down the street or go to the talk of ...\nWhat is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is put your question to the world go down the street or go into the pocket go and your morning commute without question in your mind and received the first time usually\nThing that enters your field perception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd ah what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I\nConcentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I like this tape and I've got something for you to come on down it works doesn't it\nYes while you're send to Europe be met and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental to leg graffiti back in his day when people said telegrams he'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in\nContact with and not mailing it he just right on on the edge that I'm that person unnoticed walked followed that he said that actually\nAlmost didn't celebrate that was the response so you're practicing a game that is an age all day and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing\nThey're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they shielded again being reached a menu of reaching a but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be able to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical ... what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by\nDoing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then you for some reason they pick it up\nYeah yeah ...\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments of microbes by which one of those degrees the bell said to him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor it's a non announced image to the group and people have to guess in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent my to beat and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people about\nAscend to another but this is just a focused example of something that we do automatically connected with each other where to turn into weaving field of interaction and it goes on and on dreams overtime\nRobert you've talked about synchronous city explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this when we go dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the ... or re I'm standing in a consensual elusive nations and we get into a deeper space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including that of powder than our ancestors\nTruth synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence to live on the other side of those cook in the walls of old really understanding come pushing old poking or tickling to bring us a weight to give us a message to some kind\nOf this is the thing about ... meaning folk could that you gave us would sit in front of the cause is set up

all celebrate the love of radio this holiday season and one of the greatest ways to do it is to treat yourself to a new radio or somebody you hear about from sea crane what I Need a radio with the best reception an audio that's who I turned to she crane because they're always there for you they know radio they continue to make good products\nBecause she crane loves radio to the CBC Radio too we is the best damage from radio and with the two week you can hear our show for example with amazing clarity the CBC Radio too we is designed to receive long range aim of FM reception and make those weak signals stronger\nThe high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted as well\nYou get great voice clarity even even for music it's really something so important to choose radio that has the ability to bring in those stations crystal clear and you get that put the CBC Radio to eat from she crane ordered the CBC Radio to eat for yourself or a loved one\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one big light in the middle for\nOn each corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away um I Know that I'm going to get hit with either a missile or something\nLike ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't even have to employ soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you would dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest you it sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary reality yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a Luttrell meeting but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and dark and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic of something that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional for being emotional pools\nOr something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me preparing me for an emotional situation which were not all the situation which I Need to be ready I don't know but that comes to my mind the upside down cell phone you know I just want ... holding that image I realize it might be something larger more scary than a cell phone\nBut I sort of want to reach into the dream and grabbed a ... vote lead the cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this is the way that I Am about treats I probably would rather liked it\nAnd then grab that self I let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this is the way that I Am about treats I thought ... rather liked the idea of the upside down cellphone yet scary but\nIf it's my dream my actually however many years that he has since the dream I sort of want to reach into the dream grad that cell phone or hold it to my ear and say who is that talked to me why you see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nIn our dreams where often people are often talking to the dead on phones are receiving phone calls from them I sort of want to go in that direction with that tree\nRobert wiring dream sometimes can't diluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream sauce or the dream sources of many sources of freedoms and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily is not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted or confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the ... take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick you determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get\nWhen you learn the technique of green reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing the something about living a whole life\nYeah imply implicitly in your dreams I mean once they understand that\nWe're having tremendous experiences and couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream and a few minutes to talk time we can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back to the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our first memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nWhat is more prevalent Lucia dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people are dancing yet to understand how to come loose and dream is the idea of listed dream has become very popular since that movie inception and and the ideas how to you can make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe ... the fat solution dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it to themselves but many trying memorize ways of wake you up that you're breathing inside of dream because your hands if you can stick a thing go through your um that kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to lose to dream is to start up loose that stay that way\nSo I don't know how common listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having pre cognitive dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not\nScout ahead of ourselves some aspect of consciousness checks up what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dream stand the whole spectrum they are big dreams are little dreams a little dreams that I'd rather routine protests they could walk on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams which you feel that you have received a message for those you might kill yourself in the presence of the highest source of wisdom all you've gone travelling you know you've gone too distant galaxy or different time period or a place with a dead or alive so\nPoint is that all of these avenues\nOn traveling you know you've gone to a distant galaxy or different time period or a place with a dead or alive so the point is that all of these avenues of knowledge and adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life too and then the more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that basic practice keep a journal writer don't give it a title notice you'll feelings around the experience to run a reality check ask\nWhether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do some simple things like that you're on the way to becoming a more active treatment you had to find it's getting to empower and ... and those sorts of ways\nTo go to Thomas in ... California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call Robert great work that you are doing you know I wanted to tell me Robert I'm you know you talk about you know we get tired at night we close our eyes when we go to sleep\nWe have dreams and in those ... mentally travel man maybe even mentally time travel but then\nThe night of solver we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is that we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in prom night\nTo a white cane dream during the day a dream and watch reality is maybe plastic malleable I'm ...\n... where we can not just mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the shopping men and women around the world physically travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality as a white can dream as opposed to a night during that\nWas wondering if you comment on that you seem to allow that I\n... I Love your opening statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out as a dream of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think that\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and malleable and we make allowance full we talked a bit earlier about how your your your intentions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel all shapes shifting et cetera is of course is is his feet on the debates among scholars and scientists than and their traditions of it in different so many lineages\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility\nEither for certain kinds of primal Sherman or with the technology of the future\nI don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of the sometimes\nI don't know where the shapes shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central is physically possible for those people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an early stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today\nBut anyway leaving aside those are areas which fascinating to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas\nDivide step from what's up it's up from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another I have the sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that ...\nOne room into another from one landscape or from one will into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back in the body and the bad\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things for the better make healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality or we sometimes to level\nDreams are just so powerful Robert I think my gosh I'm dreaming of\nThe way that we wake up this is one of my postal ... when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when it had bumper stickers on my car I\nMade I made one but said wake up and dream because for me dreaming is not fundamentally about what happened during sleep I valued sleep very highly including the ones you don't ... do not want that night show you exactly what you need to know but we can dream\nIn other ways to wake up to the deeper reality in other ways waking sometimes without dreams but like sleepwalk was doing with other people tell us to do try to fit in with their expectations trying to to fit in with our schedules and forgetting that allow us to all

conversation with the name of the lunar yes a lot of people a little scared about that what's what's going on\nWell they might be I mean ah it it might be scary to think that there are realms of spiritual beings beyond our human plane\nOr who are operating in territory that might initially you'd be a little daunting to humans it's an ancient understanding the astro plane of the moon and I'm Talking about the physical moon known to the Astros realm of lunar\nIs a place of much traffic where solar spirits coming into the body in this world trends that we're so last third leaving the world after death might also spent some time but it's on the right track is going up with Rob Dunn ... some of their beings off this plane\nSo I gave voice to being of the asteroid realm of living and he's

voice to a very interesting culture should a creature of this of this realm and read it and judge yourself\nExcellent listening to calls let us go to Joe in Long Island New York Hi Joe go ahead\nYeah Hi Rob a couple of things so my first question would be a I'm noticing some trains\nThat seemed to have a scene with moving parts it's clear that this moving parts\nAnd I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio as are trying to find his way out of the ship this all is moving parts and they still has that theme of he still wants to stay with us all friends in the movie or you know it still has also about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now [laughter] I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on shopping and I noticed\nA couple of times like block shots that word near the top of the black board so I had to be shopping high energy good jumping Joe yeah and\nWas correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know I was basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assessed so I Can't having the stream about shopping and I never really thought of that\nBut getting a lot of assessed so kids having the stream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping one I played a lot of basketball so what's\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot\nYet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a drink to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or in rock at springing up another type of a second you had a\nVery interesting ...
