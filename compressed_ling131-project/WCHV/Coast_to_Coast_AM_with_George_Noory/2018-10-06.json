you concluded the ball\n[laughter] well I really believe it's pretty easy\nAnd you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is I mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you're ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go on his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me\nI Will say a prayer for exactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't deaths yet\nKnow him that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\nThey can eventually but remember karma you know ...\nWhy is this is happening to them in to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you credit for one or the bar ... you never know what\nGoes around comes around that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curse for example\nOh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get that done with enough intent or if you actually go to some one first cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationship\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problem dating you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second data it's All right down the toilet so something's going on\nBut if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he had the instructions and how to remove negative energy one step taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone

into ... want to talk about the dream state what can be conjured up that way but when someone puts a curse on an individual mhm does the individual\nWhat happens to them do they feel something do they see I think some would put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down to two but you'll lose your job and you can find a job\nUm then they start thinking that's when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head\nOr if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and people don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life and everything gets going down the tubes and\nEventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go she bit ... luck for the last year what the heck's\nWrong when you then you start thinking about it and like I said you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr\nDo something about it have it removed it's not hard to do you can do it\nAnd as long as you know ... actually the person doesn't even believe they have a crush on him and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job yet and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything she's great girl\nAnd but strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day it's a papa ... I think somebody put a crush on me and and I said ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh ha and then they said ... couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to her even though ... war off right exactly so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\nThat's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words did you have an affair with a married person\nBelieve you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody ... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person\nAnd because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the virus\nOne and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off and you do to solve you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every body susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy in positivity and they put up the force field to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something on every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were ...\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have their say never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going oh lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap if he does\nIts negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's going to be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers and the slump let's say a damn\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time\nAnd the other thing too is specially ballplayers look at the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep\nYou away but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you knew exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOnce a person has crossed into the light they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a hog\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they look half the happy they look healthy\nAnd but if the person has not crossed over you will never dream of them earth dumped spirits can not getting dream now is an earth bounce spirit is in your bedroom while you're sleeping\nAnd never dream of them earth bound spirits can not getting dream now is an earth bounce spirit is in your bedroom while you're sleeping you're going to have bizarre dreams

love the truth so much\nThat maybe someday you'll be as\nGreat a justice on the Supreme Court as judge Judy could be\nInteresting to them all of them would you vote for him\nI Would have to do\nThey do like Murkowski yet he's not ready he might he might someday be the greatest judge we ever had on the Supreme\nYou may you may end up that indeed\nMight do that as well because he's been through a

tonight with with the tower oh because uh uh tools like a heroin cards uh believe it or not [laughter] um are very very helpful for\nRemembering who we are and I'm letting go of all of the [noise]\nUh [noise] beliefs and programming constructions and opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff\nAnd taking a deep breath and receiving um through images through pictures that come to us from a\nReally a mysterious place nobody knows the origin of the terrible cards tell you the truth we know some things about it\nIt ultimately the child is a mystery we know that ... it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something I'm universally relevant for everyone in the ...\n[noise] how far back as we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence\nOr fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the accounting and renaissance\nBut no one knows who the first desire was actually ... I I really like that I think it's part of what Cairo is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from above\nA from above or from beyond or or below [laughter] below\nOr within and you know I'm a union psychologist so ah we've then is the place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is right\n[noise] um it's a tool for\nLet's explain to people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not bought a to Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first ... started to emerge a in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe\nUh it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways is it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the terrible cards and actually\nIf you think of a standard set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are Connor of the ...\nThe ... has an additional twenty two cards that is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly\nUh think of when they think of tarot cards you know they have they have the magician Ryan old card and fool and\nWheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd that's your favorite car George\nYes it is [laughter] see her because I'm fascinated by\nI Know I Know you are\nAnd it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the jets card as is the devil card\nAnd the tower usually three cards which people think are the most uh uncomfortable cards at the major are coming up but every card in the tower jak has a positive and negative aspect\nI'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it became very a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot are really was birds with the weight jak or the Arthur wait\nThe writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of Jericho and that [noise]\nFor the first time the minor our economy which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners are we're finally illustrated with rich\nDynamic pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the pardon the expression Trump Card\nOn where we are going to talk about that on the right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and\nGet an impression of ... and kind of just kind of get a sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um just had geometric design so if they're forced suits\nYou know like like hearts clubs diamonds and what's the other one\nA day each right\nAre equivalent to the ... the ... of a cups swords tentacles ... won ... and all of those miners\nSwords\nTentacles ... won and all of those minor cards she's had geometric shapes on him so if it was a seven of cops there\nWould be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by now there\nIs a very rich and dynamic a image that goes with the meaning of that card and uh there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot decks today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention so that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my deck is pretty after\nThe nine you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect so you know the card is in the car has an image and the idea is that with an archetype an\nArchetype is virtually any exhaust double but\nIt's only known through an image or archetypal image\nSo uh like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the uh what is it called the uh uh can thousand names of the uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to put the idea is slate George\nA late [laughter] I Love it though [laughter] but the the idea is that uh\nEvery archetype like say the cherry edge or where are the hero here with us and with the housing faces with whatever the name of that book is\nCan be a illustrated and many many ways there's no one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so terrorists also originally interesting a\nVisual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype but it's the same\nArchetype Britain it's the same a principal I'm In ... when we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union since\nI'm we're with tomorrow we're talking about a special group of archetypes and these are called what Yom Carl you own the great a Swiss psychologist and philosopher center\nCalled the archetypes of transformation\nNot euro with a thousand seasons that's thank you thank you\nUm [noise]
