the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so what's going to happen is the presidential race is going to start right after the election on November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big deal to people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nUnder Cuomo and you know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election

but you know who came to our district and President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWe also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on\nThis isn't the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican\n... and you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise\nYou're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat and Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you ...\n... ... absolutely and by the way they are racing incredible amounts of money up and talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're jumping into this race is to try to deceive the voters Israel\nAnd by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money up and talking to my colleagues all across the country or the ... are jumping into this race is to try to deceive voters is really I I it's outrageous my opponent is star outspending make\nI've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly on still you know one of the conservatives but we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to win these elections to fight the fight because we got a ticket to Washington\nWe've got to support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gang even an upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping our small business community are small business humidity\n... it's about Ninety eight percent of my life the businesses in my region and they create most of the jobs and that's his name health is alive right Nancy Pelosi is somehow the wealthiest are the only ones benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo all\nShowing the federal government over the tax cuts it because his wealthy donors want to leave New York because they're not getting a lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight it says this is a tough battle because the\n... the Democrats have the money to deceive voters and full they meant to think even if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote at its most important we can beat them all the money but we need a Republican voters to understand the need to get out and voted really really important ...\nAll right ah Claudia Tenney are running in New York and an important see this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main ... you know ground

voting for policy to stay home that's a half a vote for ... ... ... in the Senate if you stay home and a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican ...\n... ... then you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve I've been at this game a long time of had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shot the world in the media ... ... you know I see three scenarios that could unfold ... I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full\nObjective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win it people identify the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\n... I mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote ripoff\nTake it seriously and get out and vote ... I mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career I wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won\nEspecially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff a Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country\nAnd we're not going to go away we're not gonna cry we're not going to be the cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want endless investigations were going to be there as a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's going to happen we\nKnow they only want Obama Care we do they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open\nBorders sanctuary cities sanctuary states we know they want their crumbs back you know they want higher taxes\nWe know they you know they don't ... they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the\nTime not exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nIn or we can win at all or we can lose it all listen to all of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity or you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feels smell my best your best and when I Love even more is the fact you know what I I\nI hate going to stores I really do especially ... by a razor and it's like a you know an an act\nOf Fort Knox for crying out loud to find somebody with the right key to open up the shaver\nBox that they have half the time dollar shave club will deliver everything you knew your door the executive latest far superior to any blade you'll ever buy in any store ever and it's about a third of the price delivered to your house they've got everything you need doesn't matter what you're getting ready for your hair they cover your head to toe your skin your face\nYou name it they have a doctor Carver shaved butter\nBut it shows up right at your front door you only pay for what you order they even now have toothpaste and toothbrushes and then you order what you want\nAnd you know you pay less and it's a better product and you have the convenience of never going to a story get and you can try one of their starter kits no obligation like their oral care kid or you can restock whenever you want\nOr or you can start with a shave her kids and that gives you the executive Laden Dr Carver Shay butter dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity it if it will change your life dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity you're going to love them\nWhatever your life's passion immigration at our lady of peace return\nSupport it was just a\nSpecialized memory care individualized nursing care you can experience\nLifestyle love there or not for profit faith based community sponsored by the Catholic diocese of Richmond slid more lives inspired come home to our lady of peace gall to schedule a personal point today nine seven three eleven fifty five\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard\nSees will want o seven five and am twelve sixteen\nWC Ajmi and traffic brought you buy S.
