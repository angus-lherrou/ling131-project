we had a doctor a banner with\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives as they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts\nOf a nation divided that's what the ones that the way the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house or I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing the president literally has been going state by state and then out doing everything\nWithin his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term\nElection history is going against the tide ear if we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats are two oh five\nRepublicans a two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are a vice to people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignored the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nEverybody ... me you know I make a living for people not ignoring mine and I think it's not your except it okay but I think you're right\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls by Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years the last published poll in a midterm election showed him trailing by Thirteen\nHe won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election where turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean I talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every targeted than in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to his view is twenty three hundred a\nUndecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelical for pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of a week\nWe had the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us ... and ...\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThere's races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power but then I say that and then I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on\nIn eight days in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide\nAnd get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right and now we really see the house is on the bubble we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now\nA hundred seats in play and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and what you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had all of a you know two three four five in the last five four\nAbout turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had all of a you know two three four five and he lost by four it's all a matter of who does the\nBest job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they worked play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking an election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody bought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally when I read the exit polls are five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and at that moment reading the exit polls Trump lost Florida\nLast North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania He lost Ohio he loves Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost at all\nI Do I Need barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls the five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly how do you get all these people involved\nThat they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with you Sean I I got to give credit where the creditors do first of all a to President Trump\nFor providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nomination\nTrying to smear and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen\nAnd we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood we had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted a and a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her she sent me an email\nLater and said not only am I not to target and that I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country you know at times like this Sean when people wonder you know have that kind of\nDecency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yes it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is to use the social media ... I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nThink that's right I think ah you know Brock Obama was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you trust has mastered it\nOr not only in his use of social media\nPlatform but also the thing is that his campaign\nDead in twenty sixteen to\nCatch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms Seventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook\nOr another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the ...\nWe're seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get\nDropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted [noise] um I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic and you could see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate and they'd like not\nDoing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but there are three virtual outcomes here one is we shocked the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republicans get seats in the Senate ... become speaker\nAnd then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and it's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want because we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote for ...\nIf you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the ... the as the gap that one separated the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different holes with Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there\nThat I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we have a very strong organization out there\nWe have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me she was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids bay filled an arena\nThere were over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watched it on the jumbotron ... they stayed there to show their support you simply cannot want it to quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nOr a quick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security that's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access\nOr destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security is layers of protection spread across computers networks programs and realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices like keeping software updated in staying informed on cyber safety\nSettle the buttons you walk for music set Lee's for new seed bill ...

picking limb and ... goes out there remember three year old kid he picks up a pumpkin about\n... about his size and he's really struggling to carry it and then he dropped it in the road and the pumpkin roles away and then you could hear Linda saying only believe we have ... aren't you going to get the pumps ... pumpkin you gonna let it roll the way it goes yup\n[laughter] when he said I

Robert but I'm a former it's around ... ... out there on the island or um uh the reason why I'm calling and I appreciate your taking my call but the reason why I'm calling is I think you Rush Limbaugh and went back down playing this red wage I don't think it's the right way and I think it's a rich nominee\n... the Democrats are getting fed up with the lives and the and the ... to ... pounds you know or ... and all of them and that's really getting sick of\nIt and try to hide like I didn't mean Trump\nSo I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats ... ... ... if the election were held with the Senate today we're we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely holding the father\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana ... and we'll win North Dakota\nOr Florida too close to call a Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit me of history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight we've got reticent in Tennessee\nWe've got Claire McCaskill we got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they planned to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing\nAnd the case of Tennessee got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day are Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can see pass or angry or Sean and the less not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and when the media had two scenarios out there\nAre one of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet\nDonald Trump still one now we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors of come out contrast after two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to ... mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back increase of regulating Mm watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent goes to talk about that\nThey're hiding behind ... a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for ... really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some ... some people in November six and\nFirst and not running for ... really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some ... some people in November sex and\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is ... you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing close he's Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district a million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in the high value in Pennsylvania attacking made\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth what are the polls latest numbers show or in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're going we're gaining momentum ah we've we've debated several times I made an average debate she will not agree to any additional debates are we caught her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about\nSupporting open borders actually correct herself who say no no no I support a strong southern border\nTwice you said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was\nRunning on about ... eyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is and\nAll this is a really important race a now Marty no Stein is running for the seventh district of\nPennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district volley county in Pennsylvania a it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for\nDollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election boards you know this is a mini presidential election is what they've told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned in so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any orders feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat and\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who I've been meaning and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes and I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be laws\nAnd there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise] you know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country more jobs\nLower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they won knobs they want freedom they want liberty they went opportunity that is what we want ...\n... what we have and we must continue it and\nWe wish you the best Marty all the best thing I Know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of Pennsylvania and Lehigh County or will be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote ... ... it's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that if everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now ... and you made a decision that you're\nGoing to get out and you're gonna vote ... and you're not going to stay home and you got to put any effort and you're not going to give a half of ... to ... below zero half a vote to Schumer it could be a shock the world again kind of night ... ...\nTo stay home than it's you know maybe we split but the baby in the sense that you know it's like okay we ... we\nWorld again kinda ... happy to stay home than it's you know maybe we split with the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our\nBusy telephones or let's say Hi to Katherine\nIs in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just I absolutely think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us but because of your\nCourage number one arm hearts and prayers go out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with\nThem I have a point to make about courage\nAnd by the way you are right up there with President Trump and his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country and to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but\nMaintain your credibility by being shovel and stand up to all these bullies\nAnd oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lives telling about our gear president\nI'm comparing him to Hitler and Stalin which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem is we've got to a lot of\n... a lot of very frightened people I think a President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then some ...\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner who had to call it a surgeon five years ago and I'm Still fighting it today that's that's fine but I just want to say if it's the conservatives had some shared risks and stood together and consolidated\nGot to let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they'd been so wrong Ben Sasse\nWas one of the bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them you know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh it was Donald Trump that did it you know it doesn't matter\nThat he transformed the economy all things that they say that they use conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation or energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of these things it doesn't they hate it all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they want somebody to do it in a way that\nThat that that everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old the ... way of doing things get nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington\nAnd he exposes the swamp but he fights heart\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know ... they're the type of Republicans basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be\nFriends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and I don't want to be civil that are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs that you know so I you know it's it is what it is the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work\nI Want the forgotten men and women\nTo be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that has benefited our population and then I Want security a in a world full of radical Islam is and people that\nWant to wipe America off the map and chant death to America I Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest battles military and then we can handle any threat to the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil when evil you know\nRaises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven\nIn the meanwhile you know basically a temper tantrum politics\nOf never Trump or his they're they're still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we will not have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards the energy independence we wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers
