background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you from\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know your your your match you know a lot of very interesting things and one thing or you remember that the president\nHe may hit hardest Sean uh but he always hits second any often hits last I've never seen it unilaterally come after anybody it's only after the attack him\nThat he ... down and starts to counter punch you know so all those with war and attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas\nOr a Republican candidate in the primary tacky and then he fires off the nickname you're sort of the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's gonna hit you were ... or ...\nOr ... is a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nAre let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House or a pretty short period of time and he he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and he and a and I do both I mean\nWhat about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and they and a and I know both I mean\nYou know yell and yell at me he yelled at me after the cursing gotta remember like the guy Ryan Lizz is always a total liar he basically said\nTo me in the recall but then he's asking me to do a profile\nWith them and then that's when I responded with the exploit it but you know what it is what it is ... ... what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony and I need more Harvard Anthony but you know what John what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both have a little bit of that interest only when you were a bus\nIn ... when I was washing dishes bussing tables I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I I think a lot of us in that are blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just style and so it's not in me\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story or a where we were in these aspirational working class families and our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way you see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently ... similarly situated the way we were in the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks are never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe this horse in the right place and I really believe\nThat uh you know she is the right\nBut that is in line the proof is in the ...\nI mean when when you go to Robin ... ears adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more poverty\nYou can't get three the only president never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter this GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter\nYou know now we have four million more Americans working eight million out of all the food stamps and out of poverty I'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women the the young Scaramucci's on Hannity's are now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of

the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible job that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know stop brown one when he ran again with a ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race\nThe last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist ... she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in ... when you train\n'em no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn there's no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage\nIs what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean because you're one percenters but she also herself detected fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes that journalism is on\nThe thousand dollars at old clothes I played the Clinton's did ducking their use the underwear as it has to go through it did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear and they put a value to it\nYou know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money and we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom\nAnd he said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pay forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they wanna lemonade eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warning supporter about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanting to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people know this is right after Congress ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical or she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump is just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I'd actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years from Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this is by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports ...\nAnnual hall then up by bend a boss and lots of beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\n[laughter] we'll look Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race to Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nBy the way we're the home ready he needs to endorse [laughter] and we need to get that had his locker Tom Brady is the most hated man except for\nThe New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like\nThe fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight [laughter] well look at you know Sean a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's where the whole country the Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs\nWage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that and raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent with the the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on uh MSNBC\nA few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and of course\nShe wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six trillion dollar price tag attached to it and of course\nThat was an aircraft between you and your doctor or as you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement linked Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nHow do you think so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they'll get better care of that\nHave to wait for hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nHow do you think so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because then you better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs wants government becomes the guaranteed payment just like student ... you know it wasn't as Warren complains about the cost of college course she\nTries to hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or that you know the fact is when government becomes a pair of the loans or whether it's a student just also not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive to a ... year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it as competitiveness then that's when Cosby can completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to\nYou know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here for her to become president you got to re elect her and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an eraser\nSanction if people want to get involved it's not too late deal for Senate dot com TI eighty eight you know F ... Senate dot com if you want to get involved or help out\nTwenty days till election day just promised me won't turn out to be Ben Sasse if you win okay\nNot at all and I appreciate it\nEight hundred nine ... toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program right let's uh let's say high HDL loyal in San Diego a cocoa radio what's up a ... loyal or how are you glad you called\nDo show a huge fan of yours Trump's order a thank you what's going on\nI gotta I got to kind of an idea that might help her out on the uh the midterms what do you think about getting Trump to your address to the dish and televised address that ready to fake news can block anything showing all of his accomplishment on TV\nI Love I Love the idea I'll tell you what would happen in the media will uncover immediate that they're trying to blackout\nAll of the Trump you know literally put a ban on all the Trump or rallies that are going on and by the way they do it to their own detriment because people want to watch them I mean boxers run run a number of them we can't you know run every single one\nUh but uh I I Will tell you that this pretty popular TV for a lot of people and there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty good message why would the media want that when they're in the pockets of people that the slant solidly democratic solidly socialist left\nAbsolutely totally agree with you I think I think that would I think I'm doing that would be would bring people out of the woodwork bill now because people people would watch it if you do to address to the nation just an idea\nWow I think it's a good one I like it and maybe should just do it on cable because you know everyone forget how this was the most surprise remember Linda when we were battling that weirdo pervert late night host what's his name Jimmy Kimmel\nAnd I've heard of Howard Stern talking about it I Know that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel and why is he battling Hannity on cable you know Jamie's on a network had any probably wants to be on a network\nThat I've always known stern he's a genius when it comes to media I ... I don't care that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel one bit and I don't care that he's defending his friend at all but the fact is is that those days are big ratings on on these networks over it's done any big news night\nWhen there is news that's covered by the big three networks we are show Hannity beats all of them you know the premier of whatever that big show is that we'd be", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "17"}
