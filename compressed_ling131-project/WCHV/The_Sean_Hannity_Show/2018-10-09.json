B.\nO. the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the capital issue but the bigger bomb that come out\nOf the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI has to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously\nRecord Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicle by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that's\nPeter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word\nThrough intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nAnd it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force\nAlong the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAnd you folks over there you ... you got you got remembered the way the northeast at fighter Florida shape\nEven though to the east Appalachia cola or that we won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably going to get wind gust eighty Ninety miles an hour and they are not the power out in Tallahassee during hurricane Kate which went very\nClose to the Ninety percent of the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm now I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least the gusts with this and we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon\nLater tomorrow afternoon tomorrow night's possibilities tornadoes\nAre from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so when are we get landfall and ... what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on the coast I've been down there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water so\nHow between three and nine PM tomorrow thinks one we're going to have landfall and I think things are really going to deteriorate\nVery very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday and afternoon in there you just got to get out I mean you know again with sports you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and a lot of folks\nYou can see what's going on with this\nYou saw with Florence Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the clock photographed the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter\nAnd that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nThere's look there's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote\nI wrote on this weekend I I Know that sounds pompous but you got people saying we've never seen anything like this it's already started with the climate ambulance chaser\nThis has been telegraph so far in advance\nAnd even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and if it was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then\nAnd we are fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know it was off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do when given the ideal situation and that's what this is so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own but your website actually so you have it hitting land it's really going to start getting we're up about noon tomorrow we'll little before\nRight and that and then the the the landfall I think sometimes between three and nine PM it Panama City will get that down in ... I Believe that may be on with the on TV Tonight we will be honing in on this we got a lot of people in that area of course you know as you've been harping about what twenty eight days away\nAnd we all we want to know people that listen you know I I appreciate let me be beyond here want to take care of your down there but we want you to listen and get the heck out of there if you're ordered out of there because it's a bad storm\nRight to Joe above started the official weathermen of the Sean Hannity show please you know whatever your local officials tell you I'm what I'm hearing from Joe is if you're a coastal person you're going to want to move inland probably a little bit more\nUh westward rather than eastward because it's going to make a right turn it looks like it's headed right through the Atlanta area\nRight into the coastal areas of the Carolinas and ah and then straight out to see maybe getting is upward as northern as rubber Ginia but look at whatever your local officials tell you if they tell you got to evacuate don't be pride full just suck it up take the day or to\nMake sure you're safe and secure put put that as a top priority\nAh All right thanks so much for being with us job is Arnie whether bell dot com thank you uh eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the program president now even he's saying what I'm suggesting is that is that the U.S would end up ah like Venezuela if if the Democrats win the midterms\nThere's some truth to that there's a little bit of payback I see for Senator Lisa Murkowski the geo ...

O. J. all to destroy your duly elected president President Trump and last week the ... of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting\nThat is wrong Greg Jared you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the DEA OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this\nWas the Hillary Russia connection\nAnd conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed they doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe memos evidence seen this soft coup attempt by Rod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people

John Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure miss some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the blaster and BS in Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nThey sustain an investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part that Baker divulge as in the middle of my story but I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky a\nFake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after ... when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the dossier coffee coffee that's different from the one the FBI has from steel and gives it to Baker and then Baker turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why\nIs that important first off it's not a job of a reporter to beginning evidence the FBI where we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but\nMore importantly the timing of it is so important\nThe FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um ah the existence of the investigation and all that dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court are no longer using them and hear it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor\nTo continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not how the eyes of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I

that's a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer in in turning on evidence pressuring the FBI think of what happened in that time from\nChristopher Steele July fifth twenty

usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start building and the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people\nThat literally set up an entire phony Russia investing\nAnd the Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her\nThe very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer courts and the very same people that after they lost at an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary\nWe're going to get Donald

again the title of my book is I went through meticulously the FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on when and how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American

counterintelligence probe importantly\nThey had no probable cause and yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen\nThey officially a launch this investigation Peter Struck signed the papers he had just finished meeting\nWith Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long run toward the end the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had composed this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this dial aiding investigation to damage Trump and then\nThey violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information the gain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen\nAnd they never had it verified Rosenstein
