J. I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why isn't\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them on ...\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenas McKay memos and the kitten that most of what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that became memos and we've asked ...\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played shots he he talked about trained he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our rule of law and justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that committee has shown weak leadership and I've I've I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nOr Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agreed that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and good literally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that and they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running department should not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires give them call me on the seventeenth Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the huge already ... happen in between there\nRemember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks strategy\nSo that when they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWhere you're writing I think not only were they leaking been aired of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department\nBy the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony it is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they failed to read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result it was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Broussard knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification\nTo actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick thing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll records from a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there\nTo answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got a subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan

Vegas Golden Knights Wednesday night at seven on the they don't want to seven by well sixty\nThree [noise]\nAnd as we continue with Greg ... both of you been following in a part of a unsolved ... group of us is not a lot of us following all of the deep state movements\nNow the issue today and we just had on Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan talking about a Rod Rosenstein is now saying he doesn't want to appear before the\nA house Judiciary Committee on the issues are before them and that is the latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president of\nThe United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoked the twenty Fifth Amendment those are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have an redacted and released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller ah why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nDoesn't wanna transcribed interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does deceive and live with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy show what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr ... let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't ah he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're gonna have to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more left to this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia now there'll be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour at ... you will escaped the worst of it\nBut I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of Fayetteville by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then we'll move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia\nVery late Thursday night on out to sea to the south of New England just be a glancing blowing the I Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas All right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of\nCold long siege brought in as six to twelve hour period\nFor much of the interior Carolinas they're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour that's going to cost power outages three to six locally twelve inches of rain will aggravate flooding situations in areas that were devastated by foreign so I'm I'm Sorry to say that we've got to call it like it is\nAs this comes through tomorrow into tomorrow night so it's a multifaceted storm with this park Sean as you can definitely say it's all it's a when a storm surge there's tremendous rain right now I pray to God it's\nTo God that nobody stayed in the past is that this whole thing I don't know if anybody ever read what happening Camille in sixty nine where they they they try to get these people to evacuate passed cause Sean and the\n... the storm leveled at Ford apartment building so I I'm praying that people did it you know cut out of there and they heat it the warnings you know the president has been awesome what this FEMA has been absolutely spectacular in this rough period we've been going through over the past couple of years and if you if they listen you come back and rebuild later\nBut uh you know I I fear for people who stay in the way of\nWell I Do too that's why I always tell people just just listening to authorities I Know people have said because I'm I'm looking and seeing on line and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that they're ...\nThey're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody is live streaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty miles wide bulldozers wherever it's coming in directly it looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall\nAnd you know I guess this port say porch saint Joe it's gotta be you know I I fear for that area and there it\nIs called the perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction that the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and ever since Sunday that the angle at which this storm was coming in and made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all guns blazing as far as intensity goes\nAnd it's one of these cases where everything came together but you could see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday ... as you do I do do you know a sudden that email out so he could play in the show and see what's going to go on this week I've got some good news for you we're not going to be talking about a more hurricanes this year hitting the United states once worked on with this one\nJust got to be the last one of the season a lasting\nImpact storm on our coast yes I Believe\nYou know why it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but\nMore importantly with the knowledge that you have you can import that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example\nAnd the ability to actually track and follow these storms and all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane and they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you looked at Long Island is legendary their those people had no idea what was coming in\nWhite Joan I'm old but I'm not that old I wasn't there for the thirty eight hurricane in Long Island in here\nIt's legendary out there and you can ... it ... to\nI saw a hurricane Gloria destroy my sister's house so I did watch that and ah it hit pretty hard back in the day but our job is already whether bell dot com or will have the very latest he'll be joining us tonight on Hannity or as we get updates uh let not your heartbeat troubled I Know a lot of you are going to have a lot of damage\nYou're going to be in need of food and water medicine baby formula costs blankets\nA I Know that like in past hurricanes that the government has gotten their act together they pre positioned a lot of the supplies that you will be needing a I Know a lot of you are going to be very devastated by the loss of\nOf the our homes et cetera but I'm the American people\nUm the American people the most generous on earth and any help we can give you I Know that will be available as soon as this thing passes I pay attention those that are in Augusta heading up to Columbia South Carolina because that's going to be in your area tomorrow with eighty to a hundred miles per hour winds that's pretty devastating\nUh All right let's get to our busy telephones here as we say Hi to read is in Charleston South Carolina Reese Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you sir thank you for taking my call I'll be brief out which is calling it I'm Wondering what the possibility of getting the president to\nEither director suggested the OJ that we'd go after these false accusers whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs for it's not for a criminal part but for the civil part and the cost of the wild goose chase is they were sent on\nAre trying to investigate these things from ties and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it\nAll of that information was disseminated to the American people\nTo lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they'd vote a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost in spite of all of these efforts all of the line that kind of always takes place\nWhen and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years in spite of all that then they use this phony information again and again and again I have a media leaks strategy\nFeeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell to some and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russian collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends in the media that we're willing\nYou know accomplices and all of this and then they talk about undoing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they get and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished\nI mean that's what happened here\nYes sir and all these things are again being being paid for by the tax payer and we're basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately you know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal corruption in American history\nI Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there's a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs in every aspect of all of this\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing isn't the literally the well the eye of the hurricane if he well all\nRight ... thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic song things people are asking 'em for small like to get my thoughts and prayers and everybody around the coast going through the hard times down there\nHopefully uh everybody has the right thing in places saved and got out there I was saved by the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that I I was a a number of Trump or back in two thousand six Jean\nAnd I'm completely changed my whole point of view on that I didn't think he was electable and I didn't think was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow employees in mind over it paid him up\nWhat is your mind over it paid him up the next day the pretty much since day one I've ended up sending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job here to help my family and myself so much I remember three things in my entire life that I've noticed the federal government actually do for me\nFirst was the Bush tax cuts and now this fabulous cut from other GNPs and Trump this time around as her so much money my pocket you know the other thing that affected me\nWas when my count like plan was cancelled because of the sea and Obamacare and costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company jumped are Cadillac plan where I don't think you down grounds for that and things you Republicans for more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land and they won't recognize they look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nUm it may be that there is at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "10"}
