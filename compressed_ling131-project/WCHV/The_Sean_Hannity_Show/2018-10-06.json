Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\nI think for taking my call there sure how can I help I have a question but we are my wife tired\nUh my wife and I are just getting started in baby step\nTo [noise] ah we've got about Ninety thousand in ... and we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a commuter car that I use regularly on most\nDays of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to pull a trailer [noise] her car she said ah it was about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest we could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise] um\nBut we've just been no since the car loan is is there a ... percent interest should we just sell it to\nYou know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to

of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay that that that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a

talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking to you for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college mining from my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old\nI'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash ... um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and kind of picking out some\nGrow stock mutual fund\nTo I don't see where it goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my what do I deal with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses her for um you know every any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter]\nUm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how little that every year or should I\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund\nOf three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case and so twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plan\nYour retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a any tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nIs that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published it would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred\nOkay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the elbow and high hundred\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart faster Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... investing business so I don't care what you do okay I don't affect my income at all\nBut I people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in growth stocks mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a fourth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that\nYou could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit force Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different the ... you know number ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your two ... and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget or any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy or which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget um ...\nAnd my budget them all the ski jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right that's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't that a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been a dishonorable from a service academy at three years ago\nAnd that the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I\nI'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact it will eventually end up an collections account if I'm not able to pay the amounts and fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile I learned you guys are on the Internet I'm sad and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can who got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections\nOkay when you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go way really really fast you make a lotta money\nYou're going to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nIs er so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either at the surf through and lip service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death\nAnd it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving as an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with is I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nCommon theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nYou have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full\nShe's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know of of her checking am because\nHeart when I got ... and got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I\nRest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of eventually but if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back\nThat to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you let go of the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't\nShe's going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially\nHere we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\n'em now she outweigh the Medicaid if she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they add controlled or she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen or as as a semi mentally ill and she is she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nHer ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nIt happens to people all the time\nThough what did she say right now when they call her\nOn the show you get nothing\nSo she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking ...\nTelling them either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back more than ... negotiate\nAnd I aren't going to negotiate after two months\nOh really yeah okay\nI think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months\nOut there they're going to hurt pliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any ill so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say I mean she'll show a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under their did she say look it can we work at a deal yeah or you know they\nAre Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your\nChecking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a film industry\nSo you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are [noise]\nYou gotta really tender\nCovering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake in Africa she starts making some money\nYou got to warm weather emotionally on there\nBut you can you can give her the cheerleading support the tree nice without giving them money\nAnd I think you're right to do all of that\nThere's good news show she can make it out if she makes good\nIt out if you make good choices [laughter]\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info up half\nOf all
