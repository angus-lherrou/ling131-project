just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball\nWe have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans and um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um we have a baby coming\nAnd yet when he's maybe to a um April nineteenth the the duty great\nYeah third excited so with that I Would initially gonna use you know get the thousand

worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nYeah um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know ... years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then to use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at a student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and the other day the boy

how are you have better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent impart term and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nOn the insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor inside we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about the whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent\nInsurance which is what you have to do is it still bad shall we still didn't get the terms\nI heard on the way he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I'm real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would so you need a new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay showing you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money we were because it was like three hundred dollars a month which are a lot um and just go ahead and open up Iraq Roth are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class wasn't\nYeah so you already knew what she said\nYeah he just\nLanguage tells me one of those things either this guy's a lawyer or he's ignorant\nBut [laughter] he's a family friend who's in the\nUm actually one of our friends this apparently gave them our number ... than for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life\nTold someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description\nEver\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were eighty with hand\n[laughter]\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything is so true\nAnd see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything he sold you\n[laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\n[laughter] that sounds like well Oregon ... around in the end of the weight\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are\nNot happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nOr basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nThat's what Dave Ramsey is always at four twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is liable and myself I have never owned\nWhile this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from\nHim I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked\nMarried and we bought this crap from\nHim I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shop several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that show that while there's always told me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple it takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again\nYet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with could get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major\nForeign nation wide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIs one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them home with a mortgage\n\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way\nBut the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece in great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in downtime ... enjoy\nTo not have a ... named country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just oh I think I Would probably like I have an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us and Pennsylvania Hi Carl welcome ...\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping it will give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free or which one we paid our house off yeah the way to go\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to you know fell off the map vestments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nAlthough it might not people's money you're low interest that's right and I tell you what\nJust to do that people kind of said well why would you do that well the people's money ... low interest that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great but you know have a good problem I have is we were able to\nSell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollars that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few that about the same amount in four one K. which has to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing this amount of money in the market and I'm\nFive foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental property you know outright mhm and uh and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... and I wanted to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yup it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out on you [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it I'm most by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market and got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires management by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent return I are are\nNot casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less in some of it okay\nBut uh I our our total with increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the real estate ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund\nBut I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean it is um you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on them and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\nHalf mascot follow question I'm sure\nHe'll he'll say might play point was a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm uh I'm all in a hundred thousand each [laughter] now so I don't I own them out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else to wanting to buy three and four fifty percent\nYeah well I don't ... you you know I don't I don't think I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nNot going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two bath for about a hundred maybe on it and twenty some kind of single family home yeah\nI I'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three\nThree one fifty one Seventy five is right in there\nA hundred maybe on I'm twenty I'm looking at some of the family home yeah\nI'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three\nThree one fifty one Seventy five shrouded in there a rather than five ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is not above Bonnie lies with the higher the clash renter\nOr the more they pay in rent or they users are dealing with\nGenerally speaking as a general category it's not always true\nI mean there's some wonderful people they rented every\nYou know people ... a month [noise]\nYou know it's a different different type of folks that you're dealing with somebody\nI've been both myself I'm not talking about somebody shut up to me I don't want to do\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they\nNever live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nRefund called eight for for nine nine nine ... and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare exit team dot com [noise]\nI was born with a shovel in my hand Hi I'm ... now for the past\nOne hundred and two years to my family has owned and operated snows garden center\nIn the spring of Nineteen fifty listeners garden show made its debut right here in Charlottesville first radio station ...
