I Would say it's ... ...\n... ... it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because ... right now the Democrats have two hundred and five ... locked in a\n... races for the house the Republicans two hundred and ... now the problem is the toss up ... or almost all Republicans so you're going to have to run the table on those ... ... we put all that information the most important the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know ... ... you can find that easily at Hannity dot com\n... yeah so I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now my computer I'm of a toss up that I mean I have a ... with a toss ups one Ninety three to locate one Ninety two but a lot of them will ...\n... ... ... ... yeah look let me give me one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen that the exit polls showed and all the polls leading up to the election show Donald Trump wasn't gonna win ...\n... and the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida gun North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin gone ... and\n... same thing happened to two thousand for five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen in a in a midterm if we go back remember twenty fourteen ...\nIt was for cast as a ...\nClose Senate race in ... the GOP one nine Senate seats ... ... I mean they were wrong so ... ... ... ... um I say this with ... ... ... ... the caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize ... ... that if you don't want to answer you below sea speaker ... ... if you don't want a Chuck Schumer\nShouldn't you know probably the best thing people can do is realize that if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker ... ... if you don't want a Chuck Schumer ... to be the Senate majority leader then just to go vote and do all you can do and your power\n... at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nA you know there are three outcomes on a Tuesday night one week from today is one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate to hold the house\nAnd that's the best case scenario ... one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate ... ... they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it's speaker Pelosi's Senate majority leader Schumer Mm Mm Mm So you know we have the power to make that\nAre not happen [noise] [noise] right now the ... it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends or whether you're going to get to the polls whether you liked the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago ... all the important issues we talk about ... ... they don't want it matters\nOr we're going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment ... we're going to\n... the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats or we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like oh you're the same people that ruined the health care system ...\n... with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less ... ... so my advice is you know ... let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part\nIs if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote [noise]\nAnd if you understand the vote for any House Democrats to vote for ... below sea or any Democratic Senate vote as a boat for Schumer ... then we should have a pretty good night a week from now [noise] but the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that [noise]\nWhere every American now has the power to decide [noise]\nAnyway I I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program we're gonna get a little into the whole issue of what held how how big an issue health care is a this campaign a round the sand discriminatory candidate was on with us earlier he was really good today [noise]\nAnd we have a great Hannity tonight at nine on the Fox news channel hope you'll join us for that quick break right back well continue\n[noise]\nWe've always known about him and he stands up for what he believes in town wide and follow and it is he fights still left to weren't trying to extinguish conservative voices on Saturday [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "30"}
