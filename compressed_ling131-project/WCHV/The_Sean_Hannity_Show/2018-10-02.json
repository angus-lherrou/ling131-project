have made this a part of your life study\nUm I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes\nI just when I uh I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I\nKnow your car jumbled jerk like me [laughter] yeah like Brett Kavanaugh at a\nShower and I know like a like a rock Obama's was part of the two gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept looking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that uh I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were ultimately\nThere are intellectual answers reasonable answers and we can give reasonable answers to why we believe and were encouraged by\nUh the Bible Peter fact tells us that always be prepared to give the reader that you believe\nAnd when you offered a ...\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want or expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWill the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself civil is Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nWell even the Democrats have declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story\nBut on the original story that Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing I told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all to support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal at this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nUm and it listed who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm burning and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier\nA and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christian for it's a allegations so uh I listen I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence\nTo support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind but I don't think it's there\nWell if you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent\nThat they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her but she pointed out that he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party\nUm and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no corroboration there are a big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that that Bert Katz says her friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters dear so and so do you know anything please call us no those letters when I don't\nI Know please some core operation you know the ... case right and we're at times they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapists notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years\nTo two thousand twelve\nAnd she ... she says she's in marriage there with her husband and she tells the therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist\nThat as well and she checks the therapists notes and therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that is the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats\nNow they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college and I know this is what it's found primary because\nYou're on the trivia but that's what they say\nNow we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down\nI'm not sure if that's what they say\nWell now we have the the democratic hope or Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down now Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident I'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about his drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer than he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drank too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so this has become a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here's the objects question ... go ahead where we're told us\nThat things could change yeah from an emphasis on me the sex misconduct allegations two words he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with us sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean is
