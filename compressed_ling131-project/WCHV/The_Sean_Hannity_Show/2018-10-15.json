to Saudi Arabia immediately\nTo discuss what's been going on here and it gets almost more bizarre by the second now the allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered\nThe killing of this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day the Turks\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day the Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen member Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that cause show these murder was recorded but to Dayton audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently beauty with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying it absolutely is saying is absolutely short because she'll be was killed by anyone that can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd are reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show ... this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by an interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs animal is former U.S treasury attach to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years ah she along with ... former Secret Service agent\nAuthor as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us from Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nFor it [laughter] yeah yes and I lived there for most it doesn't ten and eleven I anticipate it something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary on paying to Saudi Arabia that means the secretary of state when it does these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world\nUm I I knew was incredibly serious done and that is so\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were purchased keep it believed and we're still going to have to because if if the records are out there as well what comes out\nOr is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim the senior leadership was not involved but that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your does know until now because how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\n[laughter] that's a fantastic question and I think the big takeaway that I have from district court we'll see what happens the secretary\nHunt pay me to them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by president there's bipartisan consensus\nFor sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nThey're very locally um an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary

fact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S than bonds you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and ...\nAnd you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again [noise]\n[noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely she'll never really to aggravating factor here one you already brought up the fact that this happened\nI'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes this even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nAnd highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not as simple as a black and white situation\nWe do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing though shocked I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veiled threats that they were going to respond you know we had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so\nThat was a bad move\nYeah they're ... to ... and just to say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on that you know the president came up to the king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nUnless there's something that we do not elevate it looks like they have like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress\nOr being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had

but I Do major hill I'm I have a daughter twenty two oh she didn't vote for Trump\nHonored to speak with you a very but I'll do major health um I have a daughter twenty two also she didn't vote for Trump She uh pretty much one against the grain of everything he used on our luckily have been able to get her to see the good and everything that Trump has done for this country\nWhere I'm Adam ... is with judge Kavanaugh um she just I Can't get her to see the conservative side of it how the Democrats are going to\nBad mouth anybody call anybody four to five miles you know our values and I can't\nYou know I mean we spend a lot of time going over all the allegations\nAnd in the case of professor Ford or Mrs Ramirez or miss what they get that cetera I mean in every particular case and\nUm I Would just lay out to your daughter and then go over you know what the allegations were how they came out whereas any cooperation and any of the cases I mean I thought the most outrageous one was the final one again by miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted and changed dramatically within the course of a week from\nMy perspective and I think you know she was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging these young girls teenage girls and boys will wind up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang rape the girls\nNow I'd rather be hard pressed you know again that the media looked high or low why didn't far to find any cooperation and they weren't able to the case of miss forward the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen or even her best friend says she doesn't remember any party that she was with judge Kavanaugh so\nYou do need some type of cooperation if you believe in due process and presumption of innocence and I think we I think the Republicans handled it with the sensitivity of\nDeserves with the severity it deserves considering the severity of the allegation\nBut I'm not a person that Russia's to judgment on ... you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law and due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan Collins\nAnyway thank you Robert good luck with that um let me play you know twenty two days I just want to remind you\nWe now know I was telling your earlier in the program today Democrats or advice don't talk about open borders in an elimination against any more it's not helping us don't talk about impeachment is not helping us even Maxine Waters admitting that they're telling or don't talk about these things\nYou know but remember this will be their agenda in twenty two days they will want endless investigations they will want impeachment they want to open borders they want to eliminate ice they won Obamacare and they want their crumbs back\nAnd this woman Nancy Pelosi would be your speaker so pretty much if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi and her views and her values which are radical San Francisco views and values listen\nI can still have African ... we had to pass it says that you can find out what is in ... in\nTerms of the ... the first things around and say and I can't sing to ... to ... ... ...\n... and then the thing that I think the issue of citizenship if not just about these young people which would be tested Haitian math for that other and Jack in in your own or anything from our country who was on ...\nToward the justification for that other undocumented immigrants in our country who was under ... should in my view the on the path of long term passing earns pot\nEarns half the citizenship\nI'd ever had to experience before that I was just ... what is [noise] and then I realized for sitting on a chair with name\nSusan B. S. Elizabeth Cady an hour a terrier ... right there on a chair\nAnd perhaps misrepresenting their can people can be harsh on settlements playground and right now that the current president but if\nThey're going to say this gives them some stock and finish the slippery slope I certainly hope so\nGet said he was like to Institute a single parent health care program and cancel raise taxes I think the main roll back the tax cuts that they pass the fear is that what do you think of that when the second part is accurate\nSanctuary cities how law enforcement how how they [noise] their\nFamilies say a great thing for our country we came here who are working who are in the military who are in school [noise] who are a part of our future I Do\nThink that if there's ever going to be an opportunity to raise the debt gas tax a time when gas prices are so low oil prices are so low it was the time to do it I I I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings over the country and maybe there will be\nThe one job to the quickest way to do it\nProvide more funding for food stamps\nAnd the constitution does not to say that a person can shout ... yellow walls and his crowded theater\nThat was thinking more of a picture of it stopped the night that these things just came out at night of empire I say the cats do whatever you have to just ...\nSo that's what's at stake in twenty two days just like in the Senate if you're in Montana or North Dakota Indiana Missouri if you're in Arizona and Nevada or Florida well if you vote for the Democrat you're voting basically for Chuck Schumer because that's who they're going to vote with\nThat's that's who they will be that sold there'll be listening to that ... they will be aligning themselves with that so they will be voting\nFor for their leader and we're already we've had eight years of this and the fact that we're our memories or that short it's frightening at times to me right back to our\nBusy phones as we say Hi to skip isn't Utah skip Hi how are you glad you called\n... thanks for taking my call I'm listening to your question what are these people run on and go see the most are scares me the most is they seem to be running on a hatred for America I'm a little bit of everything that America is known for is just seems to being destroyed by these\nI don't want us to hold a broad brush and say look left the left hates America I\nThink there is a a a significant even at times portion of the radical left in this country that literally they hate American exceptionalism\nAmerica's role in the world\nUm they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't want freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged cause I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump\nBut on freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged 'cause I think they have now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump\nAnd you know it's just it's just pouring out of them you know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we've tried bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama\nAnd he's the first president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country\nYou know we know the disaster of Obamacare no millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't paying in spite of promises a we know that at the end of his eight years we had\nThirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty you know numbers means something and frankly to go back to these failed policies now look Obama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house in the Senate today\nYou know you have one moderate that Joe Manchin that's it and the rest of 'em are all pretty radical left and they don't apologize for their quote socialist beliefs that is the emerging Democratic Party", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "15"}
