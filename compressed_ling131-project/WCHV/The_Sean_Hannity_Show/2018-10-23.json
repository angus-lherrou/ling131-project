good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nWell that's right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going for a limb um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not so much money and I'm we're not campaigning and I'm we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied the generic ballot\nIn and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter ... things happening you see this a little bit was Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit\nWho explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um and and she is just very left wing\nCinema the Democrat and in Arizona for US

patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe ... you know for example\nWhen we were talking about ten days ago you and I work but this was a race between jobs and marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and you watch the Democrats\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly in the cabinet case you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night or the\nPresident actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never covered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores follow them into department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen of Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz and now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker\nNor can I say or or elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they are running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on\nA government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine that collapses because is totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it's a really bad guys you\nKnow I agree totally All right um we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change the ... the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the at the\nTown hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big time AJ I saw a Rick Perry I saw Ted Cruz and there was AJ came up on stage with me and uh you know I I

is\nThis you always have this optimism this love of life this enthusiasm\nYou know I don't know I'm hoping two weeks from now maybe I'm maybe my ex the expectations are out of whack I'll deal with whatever the results are not a cry baby Weiner and like these liberals after they lost in twenty sixteen I sucked it up when Obama won two terms you know we'll survive whatever the country throws at us but wouldn't it be nice\nAgain to shock the world wouldn't that be nice to say that the Republicans not only are picking up houses in the seats in the Senate\nI'm pretty confident we can do that\nBut if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker how sweet would that be how great would that be thinking of the feeling you'll have on election night if you spend the time and you go out and your boat you do your job especially I put up on my website the top fifty races that this is where the balance of power\nWould tipping point and someone handed ... dot com\nOh big time that

deserves to go to the U.S Senate he's been an amazing governor how are you what's going on Rob\nHey Sean thank you very much for taking my call I just wanted to\nSay that uh [noise] you know the left to always like to paint the right\nAs being a monsters were not a you know sympathizing with their poor the poor people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a oppression and those other countries and that very bad situations where we had the exact same\nStories for people who were on the list doing it legally\nOppression and those other countries and a very bad situations where we have the exact same stories for people who are on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I Do think it's a we should you know highlight those people's stories\nAnd you know get more exposure to those stories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and [noise] or we will prior we will um disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by\nJust letting anyone come in\nYou know ... ... you cannot allow them to do this they're not going to be allowed to create a mob at the border and rush the border and violent and let me tell you something if we had the wall up\nIt would be more safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened\nAnd I have no doubt that many people not care of and they want a better life they're good people their government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid from from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we want it to get to but the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed to taking people from other countries\nYou got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it\nAnd and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they wouldn't be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are going to get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt\nNobody wants innocent people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd we can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America maybe it's just the tiniest the percentage what if it's five people out of fourteen thousand we cannot risk that\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Russia border bone rushed the border and get in and we were ... reward that behavior will the next one is going to be fifty thousand that's going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty when they think they have no future generations of votes\nWe can't have it and it's got to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job\nListen I Want to remind you off year elections are really about one thing and that's you turning out showing
