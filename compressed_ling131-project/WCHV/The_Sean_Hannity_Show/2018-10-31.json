I Do as a kid you know I'm not really an ... person through [laughter] you know [laughter] and ... that means\nSo nervous because I didn't know what you were talking about like sun I talked to a couple of days before the inauguration and I don't know if you remember but I told you that you inspired me to sit in my pickup truck every night and you're like wow what kind of inspiration is that can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nWith I'd love to told me I Love inspiring people\nOkay so I ran round telling everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous or are you afraid and and I thought no but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune into conservative talk radio\nI left went out to Willis in North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets I started my own cleaning business out there I had a cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I was in my truck because that's where I could contain the audio and I created the ballot the angel of show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rough neck sixty year old black liberal women\nWere listening to my showing at the highlight of it I had a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nThree awesome internationally as well yeah that's good for you well let me ask you this\nI'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read\nAnd do the job that we need to do improve to Trump that we a hundred percent hundred and fifty percent support him because it's massive this Trump train and ... and\nStuff that sin Newberg has closed the gap for Clovis shower ward low is Thirteen percent higher than Alison there's some really good science here for going red in Minneapolis\nThe last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in uh Minneapolis in well in Minnesota for those race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you did this radio show and you started your own business\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier to the waters are Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think this is Michael Bloomberg the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much of they poured into the race of negative ads against you\n[noise] it's been it's been ... about two to one at this point now I've been outspent two to one but the good news people know me and so you know the lives that they tell really are putting the narrative but\nWe're all male in state every all ballots have been out for ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day as election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that she needed to be a member of Congress and this march and more angry protests in Seattle and create and the district [noise] you\nKnow thinks it hating the president and somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress Bush on I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled the as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen\n[laughter] yeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that's essentially what she's running on and uh and so we're we've\nBeen doing everything you know I was going door to door or eight thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes or we need people to come make phone calls doorbell with us\nDoing everything from going door to door or eight thousand house personally I'm a second pair of shoes or we need people to come make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know ... dot com come help\nYeah what what do you think do you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we buy deed and are in our people are voting whatsoever there's clearly asking a master's we really got to get people to Maryland about anybody listening to us right now if you haven't senator but I'll do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nOf the sooner comes in the same work take after list a heartless do when you get to the heart cases who may or may not vote must we talk to him\nWell she's just writing running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants to Obamacare let me guess he wants to impeach the president he wants to open borders she wants the crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nWell that is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we don't we don't have a state income tax or state she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public are here but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know and she's actually all the time for a\nFor not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in I lost their health care myself my wife and my\nMy four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much and cover things I Want coverage coverage things I didn't want covered or twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we could possibly get\nSo you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician decided for you it was called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because they'll Electra speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a boat for sure so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi\nUh I Know you've done a good job and you worked hard and a sadly you have to take all of the incoming it's pretty pathetic um but thank you so much for being with us and we wish you all all the best this is one of those races the Washington state eighth district where this was the tipping point the balance of power\nIs right there if you're in the ... district All right sir thank you wish you the best\nThank you very much on take care\nOf the eight hundred dying for one Sean as hard toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program well you've been telling me all day that you want to do something funny and that you're not even paying attention to the show\nWhile I was going to say goodbye to her I guess the by all means let's\nTalk about what what do you all day you been threatening oh I'm going to say something funny what is\nI ... it's not it's funny to me I think it's funny I think our audience a lot of I Want to do a\nPoll whole uh-huh on Hannity dot com perhaps and I was\nThinking about Hannity dot com where we have all the tossup races\nAnd only already most important reason so if you are out there and you're registered Republican you need to go to Hannity dot com and look at the thirty most important races in the country we also have an interactive map which has all Seventy races available for you to see everything ... top when you're right it's in the carousel\nIt's the first story or a ... if you have any questions or concerns please call us ... wondered nine for one day it again in the four story first\nStory was the first ... say Singapore Singapore Singapore it's not a poor say coffee coffee coffee coffee it\nForced to ... say Singapore Singapore Singapore it's not Singapore say coffee coffee coffee coffee it\nIt is coffee say somebody said to me today talk talk so yesterday I answered the phone and this guy was calling from Texas and he had a nice comment but it took him Thirteen Years to get there so I said please we'd be this up a little bit and he goes listen baby cakes [laughter]\nThis high talk you're from New York I hear you talk real fast [laughter] and that's just the way it's going to be I was like you know what click nobody calls me ... oh that's right they be maybe\nWhat about your last person I Would think that we get insulted at anything settled baby assigned\nSweetheart dialing honeybee ... like all the baby chicks sugar bye honey bunch\nCommitted Assad right I think oh there we go so anyways so and I was thinking that it will be along the ... the good so we're going to keep interrupting your show host your terrible listening oh no you're not telling them you're on my right I can reclaim lifetime\nJust thinking about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee to think about that for one second\nJust a brief diversion so I was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see host your own child okay\nWell ... ... you're saying is which has been a fact all my twenty three years of Fox is I don't work on election I this is true and it's all Fox the news division that takes over\nAnd I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone and I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime\nAnd my six computers and I want to do what I always do I want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing now the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact\nThat I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because you know I'm sitting there looking at let's see uh uh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida\nAnd I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important racist Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means\nTo heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you want running your country then by all means staying home\nListen at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is we are going to rage their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad Republicans that they don't go out and vote well very\nVery well you sound so she's already picked out the drapes she got this thing covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nBets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been on calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know the conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nOf but I also know that they got it wrong in two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that is why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight\nKids well you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically not talking about you everybody knows you vote has nothing to do with the voting I all we can do is informed people\nHas everything to do with the\nVoting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity
