sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a Dell a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you and ...\nBut we've only got about two hundred and Fifteen out what to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental property that we have mortgages on and and those two and a half years we've had a fungal graduate high school or college we're paying about half the tuition so he's taking out loans other half and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner baby step say but I just feel like I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like a ...\nLot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand ... okay so can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the stood yeah if\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these rental property as we in the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is their wings and plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger\nBrothers that are going to be going to college to hear a lecture years\nWell ... maybe steps for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which urine or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a sixes payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three maybe four month of march they find that then yeah\nAnd then and then I stopped taking out student loans and\n'em out and then to the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we start throwing it at your\nEither your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rental\nIt was but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still their houses tiny but then and then around\nYour house mortgage must be small\nIt's about ... we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay the moral fifty 'cause you said through Fifteen yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five thousand or write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good\nAnd my son is do I take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I Know there was one in there somewhere to make the maps work All right uh yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimum ... and take care of college without that first once we got college without that\nThen we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then I'm a ... house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other one's\nA little about first we're getting back in the world when Kay or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nNow okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund his baby step three and then babysit forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it up the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack by bishops four five six in order\nActually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if it was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages doctrine is that so there's still a prioritization even though some of the news is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skip tree richer when three I guess technically\nYou're given five are skipping five of yeah yeah yeah and you and your skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you know what's your back in order that's all we did you can do it good

currently on the market right now the lifted it in July for two teams [noise] um I Know there is not an ill in our area [noise]\nUm we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter] we've had only one showing we've had\nHundreds of heads on line [noise] um what are struggling with here and we paid one fifty for the house the average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise] um\nAnd then me and said that that occasion because it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but um our military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in a house in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nDummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says is you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort\nProve resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell your other than a is there\nAnyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is or a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\n\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurting\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town and they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay can you know well number four hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like can we say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers or not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away there\nWere not client's\nLocation Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nThat 'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here on for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the law you know\nBut he found a buyer wear a mask to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean why pick another real call yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and\nJust gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself after your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area\nAnd they and they don't have potential buyers and you need to it's a very unique [noise]\nSemi rural somehow resort situation oh I'm Sorry\nThis is the day Ramsey
