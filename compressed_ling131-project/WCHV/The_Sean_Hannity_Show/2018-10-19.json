pointed out are somehow over look\nAnd not overlook they they well they do not Harris\nYeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert with the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic where the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting\nA political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know it doesn't no I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixteen I said absolutely possible that Donald Trump is gonna win then ... then the the five\nDays of on the factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and you're there even got to stay home or vote against her and not to exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say
