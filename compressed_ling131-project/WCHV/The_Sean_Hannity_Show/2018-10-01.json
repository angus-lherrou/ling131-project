he'll join us on Hannity tonight will be broadcasting from the nation's capital again\nAs this will turn out to be a historic week one way or the other um Mr Speaker thirty six days is election day and I will tell you there's something I never\nEver in a lotta years now witnessed the anger and the level of anger that exist on behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these\nTactics against Brett Kavanaugh um is that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there are three steps here one is to communicate and she just did that this is about America\nThis is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in whether we keep going forward or we return to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that work to move in the right direction or\nGo back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have a set of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected hero the next steps are all going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working\nBetween a senator Coons and not in the center of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that tastes when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold on to power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be re watched us he has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nWork right there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr ... well the James Byrd add I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the ...\nYou know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago that there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls and then waiting in line to gang in trail raped them\nAnd that this was happening with the regular cards but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to where I went to school in one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging\nThat she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the tenth one was rape herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that accent or as a whole country with all sorts of real problems\nTo address and had to walk you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time football\nAnd you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really give us a hearing really\nIf there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him the codes ... nuclear arsenal he was ... and yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all\nMember tacking Christine for it I'm just making the obvious point she\nClaims that this happens from him for people she says for president of course they didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions in the\nBook it's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of her best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor border saying but I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor of foreign identified one person and that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about\nThis Ramirez or a Michael ... client they passed it and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGoing to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it when the Graham seems to be the only person willing to tell the truth but we're the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television\nIt tastes noxious for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence like where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president Lana under giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that for art or were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but\nUh I got fired yeah um well\nI mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and as Paul conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and\nFox obviously as a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion um we do sports we do culture pop culture\nIt's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show they're only job is to find new things to flushed out\nInterviews I mean I you know I I have been in this my whole life to all my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts to light\nEvery night and I see are dropped more than any other kind of explain what this means it's a really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never sent sorry and they never learn anything and so voters got mad at punish them and good for them but why would so that's I that's what I think my job is is to explain what this move and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I totally like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk to\nThem a little bit weird that like all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed to silence\nWhile [laughter] there you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there's yeah I Know it was a handful of is Tucker there's not that many and by the way it is a\nOrchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website Hannity dot com the ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker Carlson is with us his

from Clinton President Clinton and then how Hillary accused British killed all her\nThe all the people that she abused and then you got Keith Ellison where there's plenty of evidence and accusations against him well there was no investigation but just basically to double standards\nIf they were here you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations\nWe can go back now to Juanita Broderick and we can certainly go back to Keith Ellison where there's Dr reports and text messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him you know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend\nSo yeah I think that would be a consistent up position for them to take but they never ever going to do that are they\nIn less

microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford\nIs perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting her or him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled us including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nLiterally a year because of the opioid\nEpidemic a lot of them are young kids\nI mean these kids you know they get and mom and dad or grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet biking and Percocet oxycontin and they think it's fun and the next thing they know they're addicted and there's no more supplying grannies medicine cabinet\nThen they're out buying it eighty bucks a pill and\nThen they find themselves really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar bag heroin and now they're a heroin addict and there were citizen rate is like eighty five percent of your addicted to this garbage and they can't get off it and then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together\nAnd they drop what is the equivalent of three grain of salt that's how tiny we'd be affecting all inside of the heroin\nAnd these kids die and these adults or even die\nWell I think I think there's another point to the DEA chief with interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security is the Mexican drug cartels so what's happening is it's not just that people in the article in the hill I saw that\nThat John Solomon wrote it and and and John Fountain wrote this article at the DEA chief ... ... you know did this and and took some ... some of the statistics from the film that we did and just said you know\nThis is very serious and we're we're looking at it very closely but there's this huge misconception that the borders just about immigration when in fact the kids are dying on the other side of the border national security helps\nSecurity helps us both the immigration issue it's a life or death issue not right or left life for\nI don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line I did life or death yeah no no not right or left life or death I ... I heard the line life or death you get any credit for that\nNo that was very good very very catchy but it's but it's true and desert bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's happening to a lot of people and I don't think there's anybody listening to this program that hasn't been impacted by opioid addiction or addiction of some kind alcoholism but this is the worst\nBut it's a hundred and Ninety to tap day by day that's every day one death every seven minutes and that then by the way and they're saving a lot of lives with nor can which were versus the effects are ... but not that no not a problem\nFederal and deadly nice kids don't know it it's like even if they're taking coke or Hispanics which is pretty scary for these college kids they don't know that it's laced with\nThat now that one time one dead notes terrible alright well congratulations again when it becomes boss or when it becomes\nAvailable we will tell you how to get a hold of it All right as promised let's get to our busy telephones here as we say you can't even read this land is in Orlando Lynn Hi how are you\nHey Sean plugs going on how are you man oh I'm sitting by the expressway waiting on you to put me on [laughter]\nYeah several glad we got young what's going on no rationale [noise]\nNo I won't but I also worked for Bill done of it in Athens, Alabama\nWow what'd you do or do these bill was the by first professional radio gig in what Nineteen Ninety\nYeah I uh I heard you say that all of a you know pass out when I heard that but uh I just the appreciation radio concerts we had down at the airstrip in Huntsville\nRemember those on the radio station\nWe had a country radio station on a on a a you know today's hits yesterday's are classics WC why pie which was a big big station\nThey would [noise] ah we ... the one for a Pashtun radio was\nWhat I eventually became [laughter] you're right yeah my buddy\nDorm in Norman used to work in the morning there was one of the funniest guys on radio ever knows a great guy he'd call on my show all the time and I wouldn't even know Tim half the time\n[laughter] yeah that was those are fun days and then of course eating those big State Farm cutters down there on university\nOh you bet and the ... [laughter] so what else I don't mind if\nI had a question have you heard Democrats say that if the FBI investigations proves these allegations faults that they will vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nNo maybe Joe Manchin in the end would do it I we know that Claire McCaskill's out we know Joe Donnelly is out I don't think Heidi Heitkamp is going to be in the only shot at any Democrat I think at this point is mansion and but you gotta remember he comes from West Virginia\nThat's pro Trump forty two percent and he probably wants to keep a job in thirty six days so I'm not even sure although I think he did vote for Neil Gorsuch if my memory serves me well but look they they want endless investigations here they are out now on a fishing expedition they want us that this was about blood thinning and destroying at all costs\nThis isn't going to be limited in scope to them this isn't going to be in a in a week no artificial timelines as soon as as soon as Jeff snowflakes that okay\nThen no bar got moved a thousand times because that's the way the Democrats play and Republicans fell right into the trap and I guess if they ask for more extensions will get more than what we need to get no no no we need another investigation into this\nWorld is five new people Fifteen new people that have just come out today we've got to get to that a gene is next thank you so much Lynn we appreciate a gene is in North Carolina Gina Hi how are you and welcome to the suit\nWelcome to the sewer the swamp known as a Washington DC\nThanks for taking my call and good to talk with you it's good to talk with you what's going on I'm very angry that Senator Feinstein oh you have a right to be totally\nNow handle it and do not see how she could perform her duties and responsibilities to the traditional ...\nAmerican people fighting with one of your constituents\nUm I don't get it either I ought to she she Santa on this for six weeks she sits privately with judge Kavanaugh and tells him nothing about this nothing while simultaneously\nWorking with professor forward to hire an attorney ... became Deborah cats who was a woman that really set some awful things as it relates to Paula Jones and then she supported our Frankenstein\nThe creepy senator from Minnesota at the time so it's not the cause for professor Ford's attorney it's a radical left wing or and now we have friends that Deborah cats now out there\nAsking people in the Georgetown Prep community to come forward if they have information well that sounds like a fishing expedition to me it ... I don't think there's a person in the country that is not aware of what's happening right now as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and I even if they didn't watch the hearings they're very aware of what took place last week\nAnd if they wanted to come forward I don't know if they need letters from people to do so that's my opinion\nAh it's ah yeah I think we need a full fledged investigation absolutely positively\nNo doubt about it and if we don't then we're gonna you know look we get the country we deserve in the end if you like the progress that America has been making under President Trump than you'd better go out and vote and thirty six days if you don't like the radicalism that you see on display now the last Fifteen days\nFifteen days ago Brett Kavanaugh had a stellar reputation if you don't think they're going to have endless investigations into Trump\nThat they don't want to impeach him there this is who they are what they do they can run on their record when Obama was president for eight years 'cause it's a disaster if you want the progress to continue for the country for the forgotten men and women I mean we barely have time to mention that the president got\nYou know incredible new deals with both Canada and Mexico getting rid of a bad deal NAFTA now you had to break a few dishes an ad that threaten the trade war but ultimately he got it done because\nIt was these what one side of the trade deals and so if you don't say you're willing to pull out of a deal you're never going to get a deal done and the president is effective at at negotiating on all fronts I don't care if it's\nNATO and those countries that don't pay their fair share European allies countries of ours that have been taken advantage of us on trade issues\nIf you don't say you're willing to do it nobody you believe you and nobody will move\nBut now he's putting America First in thirty six days you'll decide their agenda is endless investigations impeachment open borders eliminating ice keeping Obamacare and they want their crumbs back if you want that than stay home I mean go to go vote on vote for the Democrats on\nElection day in thirty six days if you want progress to continue for the country\nAnd you don't want to give them this power which way which they will abuse then you can stop it if you voted for Trump two years ago\nEverything you voted for is now in jeopardy and thirty six days they want for them this is they want to reduce the twenty six team results they think it was a mistake they don't believe in happen somehow we were misled and it's been two years even with\nEven with Republicans in power of non stop never ending smears slander conspiracy theories ... blood thinning of the president and the media of course the willing accomplices you know do every step of the way\nI'm anyway Gina thank you let's say Hi is it Lee is in Virginia how are you glad you called\nI thank you for taking my call I speak to you as a legal immigrant proudly voted for Donald Trump or just have to say I have to say my wife and I have never been angrier\nNever been angry or the tactical we wait\nOn Thursday it was such a travesty speak about discussing it cutters\nMan with two weeks ago was clean with an honorable ... could be and I just want to wait for your listeners if the Republican Party not from yeah well you need to do what the legislative branch\nWhat we did you expect you to France finding Donald Trump", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "01"}
