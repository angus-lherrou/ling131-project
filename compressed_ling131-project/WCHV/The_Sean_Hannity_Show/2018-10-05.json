the Democratic party does not have there is not as monolithic one voice radicalism that has taken over the Democratic party and the ... and the Republican Party\nI mean it was what's been fascinating to watch with all of the madness the blood thinning the character assassination the smearing lying the intensity of the protests and it's not gonna stop this is going to go forward\nIt's gotta stop if wherever we want to be the United states of America I mean how is it the Republicans always support Ruth Bader Ginsburg gun and Justice Sotomayor and Elena Kagan then Republican nominees get just get bull legit\nThat does it matter if there's any corroborating evidence\nIn a one thing is I'm watching Susan Collins a speech was so well thought out based on facts\nThe standards that she uses to evaluate important issues maybe that's why she kept to herself pretty much the whole time nobody knew what she was going to do that was just not a a non partisan speech\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically described what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a\nTomorrow I start my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\n[laughter] well ah you know I'm I'm In a\nSystem this deteriorating I think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe say that the biggest winner of the speeches the judiciary because her as a host\nAlso attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw the day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman not being intimidated\nWhat you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being said a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism is our hope ever witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around and it was senator Collins\nOh you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came\nWhen they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh ... any of us will forget anytime soon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweating it was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping numb and it happens frequently and\nI Know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night how was one supposed to act if you're innocent\nSo the charge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but\nI Would think if you're innocent it is one of deep anger and and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think most Americans saw a man who was fighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this went through a logical explanation based on a calendar that very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad\nAnd just a wanted everybody to know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life\nI'm not evil and I I think he reacted consistently been innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out it was breaking news allegation number three at a very new and\nEvil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than that made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is going to be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it or been in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth\nShe said you know that makes sense followed anybody keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ...\nAnd she worked through the process you took each allegation on its own she went to all the major decisions that judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think they should be a ... class in the country\nEvery high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins\nExplanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days to me senator I look at your when Senator or I I Know how close you are to Senator McCain right and who recently passed away and I I've always admired him for being a war hero and I even\nHim for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over ... it was the right decision then and I stand by the day I had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nAnd I remember he said that how these people on radio or cable TV and you know\nI understood Senator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of him and I knew it really well um but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last the teen days political is down to the ballot box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this and the futures deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power too bad if what it says and say\nListen I you know went through the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is a very reason logical judge I looked at everything they said about him I compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what I Want the voters to do\nOn the voters to remember what the Democratic Party will do to get power\nAnd that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government [noise]\n[noise] well I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I'd never known Susan Collins that well I Know that look look the Republican Party\nIs not a model out for dinner if you want to and I love to I I I found somebody today that I had no idea\nThat the federal ... under which she makes her decisions and I I ... back time I respect I ... I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate and deer\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls and the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and influence or in groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office in destroying her and I'm like did anybody listen to what\nSenator call just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most\nThorough case for for how any\nSenator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for civics class to look at it in terms of the way a senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about ... only because I've tried to save the system\nTo be on those votes but but but it no more they made up for it\n... I don't think I had anything to make up for I really ... for you to disagree with me I'm not going to run my life around being somebody\nI'm not going to end my life around what the hell Hannity thinks no way are never going to\nBe honest with you I'm going to be true to me aren't you true to you\nYesterday on Leno wouldn't look like anything that\nSusan Collins she's a moderate pro choice Republican from New England that represents a party or that used to exist in New England in greater numbers she is a ...\nSchool conservative she voted for the tax bill she's a social moderate and she will do things you won't like in the future but whatever she does will be thought out and reason but here's why I appreciate you talking about Susan Collins today\nShe has come as close to anybody in my lifetime of saving the republic\nFrom the abyss because we're headed down where nobody even want to be a judge in the future if Susan had legitimize this God help the Senate confirmation prior to ...\n... she said it it's been a rapid decline for Thirty years they've cut it but I've got a new senator um okay I don't think this would have happened I don't think\nI don't think we should say that but I Will do something without ... just just for a second okay I'm going to send me on air here and now the politicians do probably uh I'm fine uh you know I'm fine uh if you can help Susan helps as they are going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state\nA President Trump last name but a few points he wanted a second congressional district but Maine politics are different than they are in South Carolina and she was not about main herself she was about America\n\nStruggling to pay for your college education liberties new middle America scholarship maybe the answer to middle America scholarship help new residential undergraduate students from middle income families get the funding for college if your family's total income is between thirty five thousand and Ninety five thousand dollars\nBe eligible for over five thousand dollars in additional financial aid some limited\nTo see if your electric cars at liberty dot edu slashing America\nThat's liberty dot edu slash middle America\nShawn ... seven bucks and\nTwelve sixty three am FM Charlottesville\nThe Fox news alerts a turning point in the U.S Senate and the ...\nConfirmation now considered likely for the Supreme Court nominee who picked up two crucial votes today made Republican\nSusan Collins up through a link the floor speech concludes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nThe allegation fail to me the more likely than not standard\nCollins says a presumption of innocence plus a lack of corroboration sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh do not fairly prevent him from serving on the court\nShortly after Collins made her announcement and other undecided Senate or West Virginia Democrat Joe mansion said he too will vote for Kevin all both announcements likely secure enough support for Kavanaugh before Saturday confirmation\nVote Fox's Geron helper and on Capitol Hill where protesters have been keeping up the pressure on him camping outside ... office others confronting mansion [noise]\nThat the White House is praising Collins so is former President George H W.
