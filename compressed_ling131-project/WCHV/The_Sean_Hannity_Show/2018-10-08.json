my friend this book is a must read for everybody and ah how are you good to see him\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that your patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and what are you going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarization\nOf the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it from second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exist read his wall so speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing so that what he said\nAt the un line yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nEven exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and good luck everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election that totally not happened three times only probably picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one an attack by a number eleven September eleventh um but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what literally jumps off the page as I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies\nSo much at stake here and that is what literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat Americans enemies and we better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWhere we have to take very seriously this concept of the left\nSo the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the the Ocasio Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past that philosophy drives to the labor camps that drives to the ... and the drive to death camps whether you're a rightwing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the\nPhilosophy and we've got to stop that Sean we have to stay true to the principles of the republic you\nTalk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we are willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war then we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with the wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual will to win\nIn addition to the ... of the threats I have full of and yet so the American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero a trustee pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would occur chambers is\nThis is a man who was Kevin old before Kavanaugh was born\nIn Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man cool would it could chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist oh in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do he had the will to fight he stood out for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh ... dead so showing his his his his the scary thing\nHe had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kevin ... social and his his his his the scary thing the Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it so ... years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divided America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm

and I don't think the I don't think the president was involved in any collusion he never was I think the big story here is the abuse of power I'm putting the fiction for Hillary\nWhat happened to you with the ... the application mourns a I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize of our intelligence is another big issue\nAnd I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again that these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love her into community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy right so much is just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations they started saying\nRight I I think you're right about that the one one question that I come up with with with this uh the OJ indictment is\nThey were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is the smaller can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do you\nKnow the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty sixteen\nEvery other studies have shown that it has an impact that the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we we don't have any doubt that foreign or services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop fat from closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously\nUm and it you know look at your own personal that's why I tell everybody get life log dot com you know call one eight hundred life like

I'm totally confused explain that you know I mean is that somebody go crazy I mean I can understand the guys give them a great job\nI I I honestly believe that Donald Trump or to cure cancer his enemies still would have him if he if he adopted they're dumb policies and was their biggest advocate for and they still have to be gave every American and everybody in the world a million dollars they still have them they can't help themselves\nAnd Sean I said that way before you ever said that I originally said if you get you a million dollars they complain why isn't the room so every time you say it's er I think you do me a world they got that way before you\nOkay but I didn't hear you say it's so let's just say great minds think alike\nThat [laughter] and my friends on\nThank you

[laughter]\n\nHow\nDo you mean by the way to leave on the streets around\nDonald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke [noise]\nIs that people think that Donald Trump as a clown Donald Jr Donald Trump\nAs a clown does anybody seriously think that Donald Trump is serious about running for president Donald Trump aides that clown\nPresident Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United states exclamation points and real Donald Trump [noise]\nHad real dollars at least I Will go down as a president\n[noise] he\nSaid basically this is the beginning of the end for Trump in the beginning of being in getting the answer is probably starting at the beginning of the end for or that I could run through the set is our favorite\nMontage town but you get the point and then they get the ends and Christian does with Donald Trump is now the winter in the state of Wisconsin state of Ohio the state of Florida the state of North Carolina a state of Michigan in the state of Pennsylvania and he is Donald Trump will be the ... president of the United states\nDidn't
