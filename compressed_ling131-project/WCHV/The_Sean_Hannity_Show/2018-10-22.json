I call him a\nHe's a great friend of mine these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background railroads his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in the book about how\nWell the mean horrible landlords actually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the Carol won a family in thirty forty your friends and I wanted to relate that story and all and I'll tell it quickly\nFred Trump

about what does the president has compassion for these people does the president had the apathy\nAnd the answer is yes he learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father is he was either building these buildings helping to fill these buildings are collecting rent from collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I did a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success in many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America that both part of fabric of America\nYou know the the generations the built this country that none of them is Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I

thank my opponent for being here and it's great to be with a missile riggleman and this Coburn for a this lively discussion of the issues [noise]\nMy name's Ben Cline and it's been an honor to represent the twenty fourth district in the Virginia house of delegates I'm from the Shenandoah Valley I grew up there I Lived there with my wife and twin six year old daughter's six going on sixteen\nUh and uh I'm a small town attorney with offices in Lexington and Amherst in Harrisonburg where I prosecuted for a time\nAnd a growing up in the valley I've learned a lot about the values that are important to the sixth congressional district\nI've learned that a commitment to face the family took community is a critical part of\nA what makes the sixth district so unique and so successful\nAt Virginia itself is a lesson and success one of the best places in which to do business started business raise a family the accolades keep coming from Virginia and that's due in large parts of the work that we do down in Richmond balancing our budget keeping taxes low\nRemoving onerous regulations from businesses making sure that they get to succeed and not a\nGet imposed upon by the federal government uh with more and more regulations and more and more taxes so working on behalf of not just rock bridge and the general assembly where I'm from but also bath Augusta and Amherst here\nWorking on behalf of\nNot just rock bridge and the general assembly where I'm from but also bath Augusta and Amherst here in this area\nUh we've had some major accomplishments river's edge park was due to the legislation that I introduced to in that cooperation with the with the state and local governments are Sweet Briar face financial difficulties and working with Sweet Briar in the state government we were able to make sure that Sweet Briar continued its record of success in educating\nA young woman and now men as well\nAnd are there is now a branch of central Virginia community college in the town of Amherst which serves people\nAre in ... county and surrounding areas making sure that they can get the training they need to succeed that happened because of legislation that I introduced and worked on with Scott Garrett so\nMy record is one of successfully working for the sixth district for a hard working men and women and businesses within the sixth district and if elected to Congress my record would continue to be on behalf of the people of the sixth district thanks very much\nThank you [noise]\nHaving me I appreciate being here um this is pretty amazing the fact that we do have all four of us up here um you know men miss Coburn I think those are for the debate um and I actually know Jennifer\nI'm you know we're actually right over the mountain from me so I Do appreciate being here I think I Want to do a few things I Want to just to get to know me I'm why I'm running a and then what I stand for so many Denver Riggleman of and married my wife for twenty nine years next week have three daughters twenty six twenty four and Twenty one of my wife Kristina CEO silver back distillery\nUm she's Scottish Irish I'm not trying to make any judgment but um she actually is doing incredible work there and I'm I'm CEO of a small company called ... safari I'm Still a senior consultant at the Pentagon for electronic warfare\nAnd counter measures are so in my life ah we've had a pretty incredible life we start our distillery back in twenty Thirteen after I sold my first company and twenty twelve\nA military service was about eleven years I was United States air force intelligence officer I was enlisted and commission so\nA pretty incredible life um and I'll tell you this when I saw my company in two thousand twelve or we moved back to Nelson County Virginia now um you know I was born and raised in Manassas, Virginia my dad lived in ... van and our moral so it was a kid I Would go back and forth\nSo I got to know twenty nine pretty well ah so coming back home I wanted to come back you know my alma mater which was Charlotte's which was University of Virginia ah when my daughter was born\nBut we found ... because not only did I Lived there for a couple of years but my dad was an electrician a janitor at the University of Virginia so we wanted to come back home so we tried to start our company on twenty Thirteen back in Virginia and I thought it would be pretty easy I thought was my background and starting in a successful company in selling a company that will be easy to start manufacturing job\nIn the state of Virginia and the great coming off that we live in\nBut I found out pretty quickly that wasn't the case\nThe regulatory burdens that we face and just trying to build something a manufacturing facility of of chemicals are in Virginia specifically were so onerous and so bad that for four years I tried to fight it regulatory agencies by myself not getting involved in politics at all\nAnd the reason I'm sitting here today is something I think a lot of you know is that sometimes you don't get involved with politics politics gets involved with you\nI was never really involved that much in any type of political leanings I Would vote\nBut I always thought that my background the military doing work behind the door and starting these companies that you would always have sort of a leg up just using rational behavior but I found even going to the state house is that we're always going to deal with cronyism you're always going to deal with people that might be bought off you're going to deal with people that really don't want you to succeed\nIf I don't even go into the state house is that you're always going to deal with cronyism you're always going to deal with people that might be bought off what you're going to deal with people that really don't want you to succeed at times so that is why I'm here today\nWhen I did this and finding a regulatory burden and what we did I wanted to do one thing and somebody asked me this\nI wanted to drive the vampires and to the sunlight I Want to make sure that we should have people that have a bad effect in our lives and make sure the government isn't always in our pockets and checking for almost that is why I'm here today is really out of anger and I appreciate you all very much thank you very\nHi everybody so good to see a packed house in the\nIn the building today and happy to see somebody familiar faces as well\nI'm Jennifer Lewis I'm a mental health worker from Waynesboro um where I've been very active in my community for the last eleven to twelve years I'm I've been um the chair of the parks and rec port in Waynesboro the office on youth I'm an elected member to the headwaters soil and water conservation board and I've been vice chair of the Waynesboro Democratic Party\nAlmost all of those things I've had to let go to run for Congress but that's okay um but what I really\nWanted to talk about um other than I'm running an anti corruption campaign with a very progressive platform of Medicare for all raising the minimum wage and so we funding public education but what I really wanted to talk to you all today well have just a few minutes is civility\nAnd that's what I Want to bring back to politics into Washington\nAnd well I appreciate my point being here today and very disappointed and the negative ad that has been aired on locally um I was very honored um to sign the Lexington civil discourse pledge and this is a great group in Lexington and I really encourage every community to start one of these groups\nIt's a nonpartisan group and they get together like once a month and they just talk about issues and they\nThere's no arguing there is no winning 'em you just have a thoughtful discussion on topics and I\nFirst it was really intimidating because I'm Talking to people that aren't going to agree with me and they put me in the hot seat um and like I said it was pretty intimidating but at the end we all ended up becoming friendly with each other because we all understand and respect each other as Americans and the patriots\nUm so I was very honored to sign that pledge um that day that I Would keep things simple and respect my opponent all the time\nAnd I will continue to do that because not only do I live by that pledge I also live by my grandma pledge and some of us already heard my grandma pledge but for those who haven't uh my grandmother has passed away she passed away a couple of years ago from cancer\nAnd I behave in a way that um I Would not want my grandma to be embarrassed by anything that I said or did um so I live my life by the grandma pledge\nAnd like I said I was just disappointed to see that my opponent I'm not only put out a negative ad but a negative ad that was full of lives um an untruth and in a time where we\nDebating what's true or what's not true\nI don't think that it's appropriate for people who watch represent the sixth district to participate in that behavior because of value for the sixth district is not wise and deception is being honest with each other I think you are\nOkay ah I live in ... county in the fifth district I live on a farm my husband and I have been there for just a under Twenty years now um my\nThe district I live on a farm my husband and I have been there for just a under Twenty years now\nUm my background is investigative journalism I was an investigative journalist for thirty five years I was a producer at sixty minutes covering the world correspondent frontline wrote for magazines wrote books\nAnd a covered the world over fifty countries I covered six wars and it's very unusual for someone like me to jump over the fence into politics\nThe reason why I Am here is response to what has been happening in Washington I'm is our leadership I think is a disaster at the moment\nI feel that a government agencies are being this re did like the environmental protection agency the department of education the state department and on and on\nIn our fifth district we have a congressman who's bowed out of the race who does not represent us\nAnd we need good leadership we need to have accountability in Washington and with my background I Am uniquely positioned to help with accountability and oversight", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city":
