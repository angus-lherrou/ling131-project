shouldn't have either\nUm if Sarah Sanders in her family want to sit down and eat dinner she's not working leave her alone\nIt Pam Bondi wants to see a movie leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running them out of the restaurant I don't want that either\nI don't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy banging ... ordered this on his table throwing his food out either\nOr Ted Cruz being run out with his wife at a restaurant I don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\nHas spoken up as Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders Mitch McConnell Ted Cruz and his wife and so many others run out of restaurants by their lunatic minion friends\nAre because as a hostile environment that has been created by the rhetoric of people like Maxine\nYou know Spartacus Booker Hillary you can't be civil with them Eric Holder kicked them and even Brock Obama back as they are is that Mr Burgess out the tears Sean Hannity up getting if they're in their face is\nThis is their rhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... nearly lost his life um and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that supports him you know decided to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been deafening\nIn recent months in days\nOr anyway Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris\nKobach is back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them migraine caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas and expert and immigration\nAnd uh by the way he's been very successful and what he's\nDoing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas who was a big win that you pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush ... across that border as in as one\nWe don't have any problem with a choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens meanwhile you've got governors\nOr like a Governor Brown out in California giving more so if if a federal and state response or the feds have to build the wall and they have to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric throw it in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government\nThat they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling aren't capable of doing so uh what should America's response be\nWell I think America's response that with the president has talked about what she's making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country why they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons or to either harm us or this day you know but there's\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons\nOr to either harm us or the day you know but there's a variety in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect his people and the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said the the other day just how much on I Want to be clear your agree with me I Know Christ will agree as well\nDon't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp because he's warned the Mexican government is warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I just I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action\nIf you don't reverse\nCourse let me let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people\nPeople that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him nobody can vouch for anybody\nAnd it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people to allow people in ... no idea what their their point of view a worldview happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWill and that's that's a very good point you know it'd be there's abundant evidence of terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven ah people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this migrant flow to blend in there is no question that that'll be the case again\nYou know the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just to follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then in the two thousands they became pro amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they wanted to grant amnesty eleven million plus here\nNow they're taking the position that we ... there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous they're treating people before they're even here to become unlawfully present in the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump yeah let me let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror\nHe said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages it appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down in the in the full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em ... before that show and we've seen a lot leading up to this and what ... what have we seen we've been witnessing sand yeah if I can\nGet one quick point before and they cause I think you're making an excellent point but one thing it only takes one and that\nBut if we seen we've been witnessing Syria\nOne quick point before because I think you're making an excellent point one last thing it only takes one\nAnd that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety nine point nine percent B. B. B. doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing and I think that's what we need to remember to this whole process and we saw that today one person or our money we don't now is now frightening and terrorizing thousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any cash but while I'm at the point I'm making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right people can be threatened or hurt and I that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nI Will tell you I went to take a quick break on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he they will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians want to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nOut of one of my assistance at the time poorly Sabbath was in isolation what was that window what eight nine ten hours one day scared to death yeah it was horrible it was horrible because she opened up a letter sent to me with white powder in it\nAnd it's happened to Don junior and his family we saw the shooting which go lease but we've been watching this ratchet up\nLeft wing rhetoric has been insane and we've heard nothing but crickets from the Democrats will get to that so you know what a big fan of liberty safe I Am they are the number one safe manufacturer right here in the u._s._a. and they've sold millions of their safe for good reason and I own liberty safe long before they were advertisers\nBecause it's the best built safe on the planet they lead the industry and technology innovation they offer exclusive features like their military style locking bars\nAnd heat expanding fire seals that are second to none and by the way you can get installation as well plus all of their full size safe\nThey come with a lifetime warranty and liberty saved truly makes them beat a bull product and you can count on them to protect the things that matter to you most in other words oh things like uh your important papers your valuables firearms things that you want to make sure nobody has the ability to get a hold of\nThis month liberty safe is offering some exciting promotions now they are having their Franklin Stein event you can save hundreds on liberties customer favorite Franklin series and I have that and plus you can save on liberties exclusive reaper series save\nSoviet cash jewelry documents important papers firearms you want to protect from thieves or fire or you want to keep your family safe\nWell they have the PR perfect antidote and that was the best time to become a liberty said Boehner twelve months interest refinancing on approved credit and check out all their special deals at liberty save dot com just go to their website liberty save\nAnything we constantly and weaken impassioned hell world and if we ...\nDot com they serve orders king Internet ... champion brewery red light management and NBC twenty nine\nThe monster energy NASCAR cup series playoff early in\nBy race seven times more than a vital eight players\nTo hide that the Chinese Martin bill\nThat first date of five hundred Sunday at twelve thirty\nSean Hannity ... seven and twelve sixty three am and FM Charlottesville [noise]\nDesigners mama\nI'm Brian down with WC H ve local news first being brought you by our lady of peace uh carrying retirement community your top story the FBI is asking the public's assistance in identifying\nSuspects involved in a pair of convenience store armed robberies investigators at the FBI's Richmond division or looking for the persons responsible for two armed robberies at a shell store in Chesterfield on October sixth and twelfth on October section the manager the store the Ninety four hundred block of iron bridge road with a belated weapon to demand money from the cashier is described as a white male\nAbout five foot seven with offend or slender build on October twelfth\nAnd then with the latest weapon went to the same store and tried several times unsuccessfully to open the cash register before leaving the store\nThat suspect is described as a black male about six foot tall with a medium build anyone with information on either is it a disaster called the FBI at eight zero\nLeaving the store that suspect is described as a black male about six foot tall with a medium build anyone with information on either is it a disaster called the FBI at eight zero four to six one one zero\nFor four or go online to W.

caught on tape while the they think the people of\nTennessee are ignorant and they had no problem saying yeah he's only saying that he's voting for cabinet he would never vote for Kavanaugh he's just saying that to get elected then you'll get there he'll be is a liberal and they'll do the right thing\nThough it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill asked to be a special prosecutor to investigate\nProject Vera tossed to investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none at it

me say something else on if it's wrong for me\nTo go Under Cover and record these folks and\nHow wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery

super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically means that you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota and middle already hearty consent\nAs long as I'm with you I can record you know I think these laws are unconstitutional I think that I Do too if I the guilty and I also think Sean they give the guilty away out\nThey give them a way out they give them a way to say why didn't say that when in fact they did and and and unfortunately a lot of these Democrats just they have to

about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI said that this all happens today and I say the same thing we've ... if you don't call yourself a conservative and go about being violent go your Thirteen Days use whatever passion you have and and vote at the ballot box that's how we do with it in this country\nWe don't threaten people we don't intimidate people we don't go after women and children in restaurants\nOr like we've been witnessing when we don't listen to the rhetoric of people like Maxine Waters to get in their face creator crowd\nFollow people into the grocery store gas station department store and say you're not wanted a anywhere anymore which is what she said oh

happening maybe now the Democrats will speak out about members of their own party and the horrific rhetoric they've had\nBack to my ... point Brendan struck a is a now a conservative and he's leading this movement which is has to walk away from the Democratic party or he joins us as well as post Paterson who memory he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book Darryl ... dereliction of duty a welcome both of you brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left or a Democrat\nOf duty a welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left and a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely my role what happened\nSo it's great to be years on thank you um so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true leaving in two thousand sixteen I went in voted for Hillary Clinton and I was\nOne of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia had been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big hit and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no better and\nYou know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts instead listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nIs that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who is caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now Sean but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that narrative it had nothing to do with news or the truth brand\nAnd let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women\nYou know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this when I when I tell my audience to expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I get\nGuy that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is\nThat there are homophobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they want dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing\nThat is true about that look look at the statistics for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted at this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seen so\nHow many people have joined your movement\nSo that the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty on ... or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like they\nAre telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there is this is for me like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring and buzz Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary ... we can't be civil with with people we disagree with us from like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night and I went you know and this was right in the middle of the cabinet hearings and it was being a lunatic and I ... I was ... cents an hour you\nWhat's going on man I'm I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream at him and I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not affecting my said if you'd like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it and why are people acting in a way\nYeah well you know my story ... I I I went up to the White House or as the air force\nBlacks lake you know like in ... for two years after I lost that position I loved the White House office of the bedroom and travel\nAnd that are worth they were with the world and after I left and I I also walked away so I mean I'm not quite the transformation that Brandon is but I I went in as a military officer proud to serve like less\nResulted in election of ... and then granted on I've hooked up on social media so I mean I'm going to be at age ... it'd be a great tabloid\nChecking your thousands and thousands of people to be walking away I should get testimonials and I can't wait I mean it's going to be fun and it's also going to be asked him to send a signal to the rest of the country that can aquatic party stands for nothing is substantial\n... they they ... they ... a license\nThe rest of the country that in a crowded party stands for knocking get substantial ... ... ... a lie down and talked about it in mainstream media specialized thank God for you shot and what you do um but it's time for people to wake up whether you\nKnow I'll tell you one thing I don't like being lied about um you know twenty twenty I I don't I'm not a racist and I don't want to be called one I'm not a sexist or a massage therapist\nOr a homophobic Dina phobia Islamophobia I Want clean water not dirty water clean air not dirty air I Love all children they're all children of God\nAnd I I Believe that you know what we got to take care of the elderly whether they can afford it or not we're country rich enough to be able to do that\nThese lies that they tell really pissed me off because that is not any conservative Brandon that I Know but conservative policies especially when you compare them to ... eight years of failure of Obama\nWe see a dramatic turn around\nFor the forgotten men and women in this country in other words Sean Hannity Thirty years ago that's what I Want for the country\nI think that's what we all watch ah for the country\nI Am glad you guys are doing this event it's on the twenty seventh it's wearing a DC", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "24"}
