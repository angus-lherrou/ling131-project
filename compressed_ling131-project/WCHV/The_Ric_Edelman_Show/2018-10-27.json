one point six billion dollars\nAnd it's you know I I it's just kind of crazy the odds of winning where one in three hundred million which is roughly you know the one person out of America because there's about three hundred million of us that was roughly the odds of winning\nAnd let's not get carried away okay was one point six billion actually but the actual number was one point five three seven\nTo be you know technical about it but you know roughly one point six billion dollars but no no no no no no it wasn't that's if you took it as an annuity if you took the money in equal installments over twenty nine years you would end up receiving a total at one point six billion dollar so but no\nYou wouldn't be taking that you'll take the lump sum you'll give me\nThat's eight

weekends only uh so we're very excited to be welcoming all of you who are listening to the Rick Edelman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're going to be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this was such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or at our organization uh we manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a Barron says ranks hour from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we um want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients and I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock\nMarket this past week volatility has returned but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact\nIs that as a result of the volatility this week\nYear today the Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent\nThe S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent the easy index which is the index of foreign stocks that the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the talent yes in pay and the ISI are down one percent one percent twelve percent\nIt's actually even worse than that there are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them are down ten percent or more from their hives so although the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them\nAre down ten percent or more in the S. and P. five hundred the S. and P. itself is down one percent for the year but eighty percent of the S. and P. five hundred we're talking\nFour hundred of the five hundred stocks are down ten percent or more from their hides in the ISI Ninety percent are down ten percent or more from their hives in the back eighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more\nFrom their eyes so if you look at your market performance recently\nYou will see some pretty substantial declines year to date it means that we have had all the profits accumulated\nSo far this year from January one for the end\nOf September those gains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one ... down one if you down twelve\nAnd it's not just limited to that gold is down six percent year to date the real estate market as measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index down four percent\nFor the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up all of them ... percent demonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything\nAlways goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that'll be we don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a\nBig bet we diversify we diversify\nWe don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a big bet we diversify we diversifying two ways we diversify among us the classes yes she won't stocks but yes you should also I'm bonds and you should also own\nForeign securities and you should also alone commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you break one you gotta love and left that's the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you buy as many stocks as you can notice I said that in the S. and P. five hundred the index itself is down one percent for the year\nBut eighty percent of the stocks have lost ten percent or more in the recent weeks eighty percent of them are down ten percent in just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point set of trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're better off\nOwning the market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear actively managed mutual funds\nMeaning mutual funds that hire a professional manager whose job it is is to pick stocks that will beat the market they have a dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail\nTo beat their index they fail to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks midsize stocks are small stocks growth stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign stocks doesn't matter that also doesn't matter what time period you look at you could look at your date you could look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThe data is consistent\nFund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager that does succeed beating the market that manager is unable to duplicate their success\nSo while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick this year the manager that did best last year they're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nMaintain a long-term perspective focusing on not the market not politics not policy not the fed but focusing instead on your goals\nAre you investing in the first place what are you trying to accomplish is it to get a kid in the colleges that to prepare for your own retirement is is take care of aging parents why are you investing that determines for us\nHow much money you're going to need that much money do need to achieve those goals how much will college cost how much will your retirement costs how much will cost of care for mom\nOnce we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we can work backwards do some calculations to say\nHere so much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning and in order to get that return at a reasonable expectation here's the investment strategy here's the mix up investments the asset allocation necessary that makes sense\nIf you're not approaching your investment strategy in that way you might be doing it wrong and that's why we encourage you to focus on it and that way if we can help call us a triple eight plan wreck that's AAA seven five to sixty seven forty two when we make it really easy for you as well instead of dealing with voice mail\nWe can help call us a triple eight plan wreck\nThat's AAA seven

lose your job is it possible\nThat your occupation could be eliminated not because of a bad economy goodness gracious our economy is absolutely fabulous we have more jobs available in our country than we have people looking for jobs which doesn't seem to make any sense right and if everybody was looking for a job and there are jobs out there how come we don't have a hundred percent full employment\nMaybe it's because the people who are looking for jobs don't have the skills\nThat are required for the jobs that are available in other words we're talking about career development is it possible that despite the fact the economy is strong your job might be threatened due to exponential technologies particularly robotics and artificial intelligence\nIs it possible your job might be wiped out by technology the most common example that everyone's aware of\nOr taxi drivers\nJust because of over and left which are examples but the coming self driving vehicles which will wipe out even the ... river and lift drivers in two thousand eight\nMember what was going on in the economy in two thousand a bad news right state local governments are struggling to raise tax revenue so San Francisco\nOn on on the economy in two thousand me bad news right state and local governments were struggling to raise tax revenue\nSo San Francisco started selling taxi medallions you want to drive a taxi in San Francisco you gotta buy medallions giving you the right to drive a cab they were selling them for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars dozens of cities sold them to generate revenue and what a medallion\nYou could drive and make seven grand a month pretty good income for being a cabdriver and you could sell your medallion if you felt like it it became a market where people were buying and selling medallions\nThe value of medallions rose really fast and New York the medallions hit one point three million dollars in value people were getting rich trading medallions\nThen came along over New York city medallions fell from one point three million to a hundred and sixty grand\nIn Philadelphia the medallions fell from half a million dollars to ten grand\nThousands of cab drivers around the country have lost huge amounts of money in San Francisco there has not been a single medallion bought or sold in more than two years which means they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in revenue\nA hundred and fifty of those drivers of now the fault it on the loans that they took out to get those medallions and the New York city seven cab drivers have committed suicide over their financial strife\nYou've got to ask yourself is it possible that\nMy job might be eliminated due to a technological innovation\nAnd if so what are you going to do about it how soon are you going to prepare yourself for retraining in a career that will capitalize ON Technology development as opposed to being disrupted by technological innovation\nLet us help you figure this out\nIn my book the truth about your future which debuted at number four on the New York times business bestseller list I lift the one hundred Seventy five occupations that are going to be eliminated over the next five to Fifteen Years because of robotics and artificial intelligence\nYou need to find out of your job is on that list and even if your job is not on the list you need to find out if your company is that threat I remember talking with a woman who is accounting and she said I'm not being threatened by technology on an accountant she worked for Toys R us\nSo she her job was being threatened because of tours restaurant broke she lost her job\nSo you need to evaluate this not just from your career but the company you were working for and the sooner you identify this the better off you're going to be because if you do need to get retrained where does that money come from how do you maintain your lifestyle wall paying the bills of education\nWithout an income at the moment this was all part of the new dynamic of personal financial planning and we can help you call us a triple late plan wreck

you thinking of changing jobs\nYou know the economy is really strong and because of that their job opportunities out there that hasn't existed in the past few years and you might now have the opportunity to go get yourself a bigger better job a promotion of raise\nCareer advancement lot of Americans are doing this when you change jobs when you leave your employer\nWelcome back to the Rick element show triple late plan records our phone number that's AAA just seven five to sixty seven forty two and online at ... dot com that's rice gentleman dot com but said right after the questions okay we're talking to Mike He sent you a question to ask Greg\n... dot com\nI wrecked my from Evanston, Illinois\nI've learnt to things from listening to you over the last Twenty years number one I can retire and the custom I'm used to when approximately three percent of my savings will cover my annual expenses number two safe to exponential technology\nMiddle live longer than ever and probably should plan on having my retirement money last until I'm at least a hundred and Twenty years old so my question is how do I count for inflation in my annual expenses and the calculation of retirement costs I found a a inflation calculator on the Internet\nShe told me if my current monthly expenses and three thousand fifty years from now when I'm only a hundred and ten\nMy monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars and this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise] so do I need three percent of my savings to cover ten thousand dollars given the high likelihood of inflation when it's costing me three thousand dollars now\nOr how do I have very this over time do I need to work longer save more keep my investments in a more aggressive mode to cover the costs of inflation is is how we're going to compensate for\nPotentially up to six years of inflation\nMike your right to all three in other words your ear over complicating this a little bit ah\nInflation will take it's toll over time but there's nothing new about that inflation is taking them taking over time for a long as there's been times we all know that everything is more expensive today than it was fifty years ago and everything will be more expensive than it is today fifty years from now so there's nothing new there so don't worry about it in other words history tells us\nThat a diversified investment portfolio earns more over long periods of time then the inflation rate now there's no assurance that that'll be true in the future but that's the basis on which all investment strategies are built there's no reason to believe it won't be true in the future although we can't promise that are guaranteed here\nSo on that assumption which is what it is you can assume that your investments will grow over time at a rate faster than the rate of inflation which is how your nest egg in the future will be big enough\nThat when you withdraw three percent or four percent a year from a portfolio it'll produce the income you need even if your income as a whopping ten grand imam which by the way as a matter of income some people need even today so don't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half of your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year\nOh don't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half of your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year to pay your bills no matter how how those bills had might happen the day you asked\nDo you work longer the save more do you earn higher returns yes yes yes we have to recognize as I've been talking with you about on this program for the past several years and is the basis of my book the truth about your future which they due to the New York times business but so it was the number four we have to recognize that the future\nAnd what it used to be as Yogi Berra said\nYou're not going to live to eighty five or nine Ninety five chances are you're going to live to one oh five one Fifteen one twenty five but you have to recognize that life is going to be much longer due to medical advances and technological innovations that are extending longevity\nAnd on that basis\nWe have to recognize that a retirement at age sixty five is probably not realistic for an awful lot of folks\nYou're going to probably have to work longer that doesn't mean you're going to necessarily have to work sixty hours a week making a hundred and fifty grand a year it might be working a few hours a week making ten or twenty grand a year you're going to need to save more than you probably are right now so I Would encourage you if you're not already maximizing your contributions to your retirement plan at work\nToo so add an extra one percent of your savings rate at work\nAnd make sure you're earning a competitive rate of return make sure that your investment returns are exceeding the inflation rate so your money is actually growing in real economic terms if inflation is two percent and your bank account is paying one\nYou're losing one percent in real economic terms so we need to make sure that your investments are growing with the pace of the cost of living and that means you need to\nMake sure that your investments are growing on average over long periods of time not necessarily every single day a week or month or quarter year but over long periods of time on average your overall portfolio was earning a return exceeding that\nOf inflation and if you will do those three things work a little longer maybe save a little more maybe earn a little bit more maybe then yes you can expect your future retirement your future lifestyle to the everything that you want it to be and if you're not sure how to do all of the above how do you design your\nCareer structures that you can generate income either on a part time basis how do you figure out how to lower your expenses in order to free up extra cash to save and how do you structure your investments so that you can achieve your goals you've got questions with any of those three\nCallers triple a plane wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty to several within thirty seven thousand clients across the country we've been doing this for Thirty years\nAnd we're happy to do it for you as well you don't have to go it alone you don't have to do what is on familiar to you might be the first time you've ever tackle these questions is not the first time we

diamond ring a twenty three carrot diamond bracelet luxury homes and a hundred thousand dollar membership to a private fitness club or that's a heck of a fitness club for a hundred grand anyway that kinda stuff happens but I Want to tell you one in particular that the FCC just announced that takes the cake\nThis one this one is just I I don't I don't like the guy's name is Bruce six cell he's from Hillsdale New Jersey now previously\nThe guy had already been fined by the SEC for whipping clients off if they find him one and a half million dollars so the guy's a crook and the FCC nailed him and he owes the SEC one and a half million dollars so\nIt raises a question where does he get the money to pay the fine he got the money\nBy stealing money from [laughter] see is now charging him with fraud for raising three million dollars from investors\nTelling them he was going to put the money into stocks and instead use the money to pay back\nThe FCC\nWhat you have done is I mean you can't
