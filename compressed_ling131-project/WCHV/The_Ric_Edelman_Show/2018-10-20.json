with us half hour or triple late to plan records our telephone number on line at rice Spelman dot com let me ask you a question without your investments that's a big subject these days with the recent market volatility than we've had over the past couple of weeks [noise]\nWhat is the rate of return your expecting from your portfolio\nOn average per year\nOver the next ten years now I'm not suggesting you should be looking at what you're ready to return ought to be this year or what it is the past quarter or what it did yesterday or you know earlier in the week no I I mean\nWhat rate of return on average long term would you think is a reasonable expectation to receive\nWell here's a guideline for you that might be helpful the Ohio public employees' retirement system\nThis is the state of Ohio which manages money for the retirement of all of the employees who work for the state of Ohio they manage one hundred billion dollars on behalf of tens of thousands\nProbably hundreds of thousands of employees and the state of Ohio they project how much money they're going to earn on their investments for an annual basis and they have just lowered their assumed rate of return\nFrom seven point five percent to seven point two percent per year\nSo was your gas was your expectation and when I ask you the question higher than seven point five I suspect that for a lot of folks the answer would have been yes we routinely come upon people\nWho tell us that they expect to earn eight percent a year ten percent a year twelve percent a year\nAnd I'm here to tell you that the average annual return of yes and the five hundred since Nineteen twenty six according to ...\nIt's ten percent a year if you have a one hundred percent stock portfolio and you leave that money invested entirely in stocks for decades you might be able to get a ten percent return\nYou might just because that did that in the past as I mean that's what you're going to get in the future we all know pest performances and guaranteed future results we all understand that right but the S. and P. five hundred US stock market has historically the best performing asset class no other investments do as well as us stocks not real estate not gold not bonds\n\n\n\n\n\nHey don't rush off at three it's the Sean Hannity show weekdays at three on WC age v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it there were many liberal arts majors that was Judy jak also wrote and he wanted to voice their displeasure with the article to he was annoyed that the article made no mention of the other values of education regarding liberal arts and he felt that my article overvalued monetary gain in the educational pursuit\nWhile I really do appreciate Judy's and Jack's comments and I you may have similar feelings but you know what\nJudy Zaidi for her daughter is sixty\nJak is Seventy to the world was oh totally different when they went to college Judy went to college sixty years ago back then a liberal arts degree was of great value not just individually but also to help securing an excellent career I she proof\nBut that's no longer the case today students spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more plus six years on average to get a degree of thirty students drop out in their freshman year even after they might have spent thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars less than half of students graduate even after six years\nBut they still walk away the student loans an average of thirty grand prix student\nHalf of Americans today have student loan debt\nToday going to college is a huge financial commitment with enormous implications on the lives of the students so yeah sure I'm willing to bet that if we pull our clients is Judy suggests\nWho went to college Thirty years ago forty fifty sixty years ago yeah a liberal arts majors will in fact be revealed to have had successful careers but that's driving by looking through the rearview mirror\nThe fact that it worked in the Nineteen hundreds\nHe revealed to have had successful careers but that's driving by looking through the rearview mirror the fact that it worked in the Nineteen hundreds doesn't mean that those degrees are properly preparing students for the futures that they're going to have now look I'm a liberal arts graduate myself\nSo I Know the full value without education\nBut when I went to college in the Nineteen eighties I paid sixty eight bucks a month for housing tuition was twenty five hundred bucks a semester\nToday tuition room and board is routinely exceeding fifty thousand dollars and so yeah sociology psychology history poetry they're all very important but we've got to examine these majors for their economic viability due to their cost so yes get that knowledge\nBut we need to do it more cheaply get it on line through self study or other ways and we need to focus instead\nOn what college has unfortunately become a platform for career preparation\nThe U.S economy according to the apartment of labor now has seven million jobs available\nWe only have six million unemployed workers this doesn't make any sense first time this was ever happen according to the Labor Department how was it you've got six million people out of work but seven million jobs available there's only one reason for this\nThe people who are out of work are not trained for the jobs that are available that's the problem\nSo yeah I'm afraid that um\nThe cause might be lost you know the notion of going to school for personal enrichment and development might be lost and I say that with limitation because I shared Judy's concerns and I share jacks concern\nBut as a financial planner my duty is to help our clients get their kids off to a good start in life without jeopardizing the parents owned retirement future\nAnd so I simply can't endorse the decision to let an Eighteen year old decided to major in a career\nAt a private out of State University that will cost two hundred thousand dollars over six years that isn't going to lead\nTo a job opportunity you know I'm Sorry when someone says to me that they're going to major in philosophy and my great you're going to go work for a philosophy company I mean it just it just doesn't seem to make any sense anymore higher ed is not what you and I fondly recall it to be it's a brave new world nowadays\nAnd so I've got no choice but to help our clients and their kids navigate it effectively I'm Sorry that that's the situation but I figure it's better to acknowledge it\nThan to ignore it and if you want any evidence of this just look at the announcement made this week\nBy the c._e._o. of bank of America he says that he has just finished cutting one hundred thousand jobs in less than a decade at the ... and he said quote it was all caused\nBy the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities unquote\nHe says they're twenty six million of the banks customers that are using the mobile banking at\nTherefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence and robotic process seas have allowed the firm to cut out eighty four thousand work hours a year you only work two thousand hours a year they've just cut out eighty four thousand hours a year you do the math\nHe said the bank had too many managers about thirty thousand of them and so he fired a third of them over just the last couple of years is it any wonder that according to Gallup only forty eight percent of the American public has a lot of confidence in higher education\nAnd this is why it's so important that we apply a proper lens and the question of will my child go to college and it's so\nAnd this is why it's so important that we apply a proper lens and the question of will my child go to college and it's so what will be that major and what institution will the child a chance to get that degree\nBecause spending two hundred thousand dollars on a degree that doesn't provide the economic reward\nIs setting your child up for failure not success think about it because your child's financial future depends on it\nSo if your child headed to college if you're struggling to figure out what college you should let your child is

it kind of makes sense doesn't it to offer lifetime income opportunities so talk about that limb\nWell that's an area that policymakers have ... and to get their arms around I think for a long time the focus had been on accumulating assets\nAnd I think it has the focus has shifted part of that is because so many people are close to retirement lifetime income options as a form of distribution as a way of receiving your money\nSuch as a monthly income over the rest of your life has not been a common distribution option that was included in four O. one K. plans\nAnd so I think what is happening now is to figure out how would a house to have that kind of option in their plans\nIn my experience as a financial advisor most of the training that advisors get is on helping clients put money in\nOne of the contribution limits what are the investment options how do you build a portfolio is relatively little training on how do you take the money out and how do you do so in a manner that will not only made the Clintons today but it able to sustain that need over the course will be retired last time\nI mean even more to a point it's not just about retirement income it's really about overall financial wellbeing and so I Know that the American benefits counsel was really focused on the broader more holistic motion of world being so limb share with us with that's all about\nThat is an area of of extreme importance to plant sponsors many of them have adopted these very broad financial wellbeing programs that covered the gambit of\nHow much should you save what our barriers that are keeping you from saving because many people do have barriers to saving such a student loans or\nA lack of emergency funds or just not great management skills not not a lot of budgeting management skills and then they want to help people understand what the different investment options are\nHow to how to manage your money as your career progress as and then how to manage your money in retirement including\nNot only how to make your money last\nBut you need there there are other things that you need to consider as well things like what will the cost of healthcare be a how will I manage a where I live uh how will I manage\nA you know the allocation of my money to uh investments versus income because even in retirement you're still going to want to be earning some money on the amount of money that is invested so these are all things that you have to think about\nWhat percentage of employers are engaging in these kinds of programs or for their employees\nSo when you talk about the very large companies the fortune one hundred even the fortune five hundred it's growing exponentially so a very large the larger the company the more likely they are to have these programs\nOne of the problems of course is that most of America is employed by small companies small businesses\nYeah that's exactly right so one of the challenges for policymakers is how to help small employers do the same thing\nWhat advice would you give listeners if their employer\nProviding a wellness program for the\nWell the first thing you you want to do is ask them if the\nOr isn't providing a wellness program for them well\nThe first thing you you want to do is ask them is that the company offers some educational information\nAlso I think asking yourself how are you planning to pay for health care and retirement and the other thing I Would tell people is that you should look at how much Social Security will pay you pay attention to Social Security\nI think that a lot of folks are overestimating how much money they're likely to get from Social Security especially higher income Americans because there's a max but Social Security will provide the average check\nAs you know Lynn is about Thirteen hundred dollars a month for Social Security retirees\nAnd of course the Social Security system is under threat right now because the trust fund is being depleted and that's why the American benefits council has joined the funding our future coalition talk about what your aspirations are and why you decided to have the American benefits council joined the coalition\nThe funding our future is in really incredibly important initiative across the country it's it's important for multiple reasons\nOne it raises the profile of the issue to to your listeners into the public so that the public is aware that they need to be thinking about these things\nWhile they're working not thinking about them at the end\nThough if you are close to retirement you should start thinking about them or even in retirement be you know think about them now\nSo part of it as that but part of it is also to create a momentum\nSo that we as a country can engage on a ... in a discussion about\nA policy that uh you know as a country wide in a society wide policy of how we can help people in retirement and how we can address the gaps in retirement and work with policymakers to come up with\nVery pragmatic practical solutions that work\nUm for people and for the employers that are providing the plans\nSo I'm really glad you were able to spend the time with us on the program Lynn thank you so much for doing this I really appreciate it oh you're very welcome\nThat's wind doubly the senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policy at the American benefits council and a member of the funding our future coalition you can learn more about it at funding\nOur future dock us elements we're here to help you trouble the plan wrecked which Tripoli seven five to six to seven forty two you're on the ... when ... online at rice don't [noise]\n\nWe'll ward winning PBS TV theory about buddy coming up on a radio show\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nAnd your income last for the rest of your life\nHi I'm Rick ... mail you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free without free retirement review\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know the past performance is no guarantee of future results any social the countries of federal sense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter's not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called a U. T. M. a uniform transfer to minors act\nA UT amazing account it simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter and uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette\nSo or for that reason especially since you're targeting us for college we might instead recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans\nSo uh for that reason especially since you're targeting this for college we might instead recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and in this way you will in the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed use the money for college\nThan the withdrawals are completely tax free no taxes at all it's fabulous and that's why the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money at any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nOr if you don't use the money for college them withdrawals will be subject to taxes when the ten percent penalty but you could always transfer the money to another child if you've ever have another one or two cousins of your daughter you could even leave the money there for your daughter's children and another Thirty years so\nLots of fabulous flexibility associated with the five twenty nine plan so that's what we'd recommend it to five twenty nine plan targeted for your daughter but I Want to emphasize one other very important point that might have slipped\nPast us without focus remember I said that in any Fifteen or twenty year time period stocks have never lost money on that basis you can go ahead and put a hundred percent of the money into stocks right now\nRight but\nWhen your daughter is twelve\nShe's no longer going to have necessarily Fifteen Years before she uses the money\nWhich means as she ages we're going to want to ramp down the\nAllocation of stocks because the closest you get to college the less time the money will remain invested and the greater the risk of the stock market crash undoing all of the good effort we've tried for all those years so a one hundred percent stock allocation makes sense now but it doesn't make sense when she's Fifteen\nOr Eighteen that makes sense yes so we want to create something called a glide path picture of the airplane you know with traveling at forty thousand feet but not when it gets near the airport\nAs it approaches the airport it alters that's glide path and as it gets closer it gets lower and lower so that by the time it reaches the airport it's really close to the ground same thing with your daughter as she gets closer to using the money\nWe have less and less of the money in stock so that by the time she's sixteen if you're going to use the money at age Eighteen she'll have virtually none of the money in stocks because we're so close to using the cash that makes sense\nThat does is this something that we could do within the five twenty nine\nYes yes you can and there are two ways to do it one is to choose your own asset allocation and you control how much of it is in stocks you put a hundred percent stocks today but as she ages you declined that a hundred percent on that Ninety eighty Seventy sixty forty et cetera overtime as she approaches the use of the money or\nBecause of the nuisance that's a chore that's difficult a lot of parents don't know how to do it\nMany five twenty nine plans offer what are called target date funds where they'll do it for you and the target date fund you choose a fund that is targeted for when you think your daughter will use the money so you would choose for example a twenty year target date fund\nBy choosing a target date fund they will create the glide path for you they will alter the allocation as your daughter ages automatically without you having a facility\nUnderstood\nSo either do it yourself or let them do it for you but either way\nAges automatically without you having a fossil\n\nUnderstood so either do it yourself or let them do it for you but either way\nDo excellent\nI appreciate it thank you it's my pleasure I'm Glad you called and I'm really excited that your daughter's getting off the such a great start in life and are you guys keep that up and a boy oh boy oh boy will she be able to take care of you and\nYour retirement that's the wife and I think it's a bunch of uh [noise]\nI'm Rick
