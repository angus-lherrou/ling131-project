B. [noise]\nFor them back to the program Rick Edelman here thanks for hanging around with us on the show today I told you that you really shouldn't be making any changes in your investment strategy as a result of what's been going on in the stock market this past week but\nThere is something that I think you do want to do and I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nKnow it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the volatility the markets what you really need to be paying attention to is what's going on in the bond market according to the Bloomberg Barclays multi verse index this is an index of all bonds all around the world\nMark it according to the Bloomberg Barclays multi first index this is an index of all bonds all around the world they fell in value by about a trillion dollars this past week [noise]\nA trillion dollars why because the fed is raising interest rates as interest rates go up the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic I'm almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bonds for safety\nOnly to have their money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nSo here's what you need to do beyond all else gentleman as you're thinking of how you ought to make changes in your investment portfolio you ready for this here it is I Want you to talk to your wives and girlfriends\nAnd do what ever they tell you to do why because according to research firm fidelity\nWomen consistently earn higher returns than men in their investment portfolios an average of almost half a point per year\nWhy because women trade less often women are more deliberative the more methodical they are more\nConsiderate they evaluate more carefully they aren't quick to make a snap decision and that translates into not jumping out of the market nearly because the market went down one day\nSo men before you do something dumb [noise] and before you have to pay for it when you explain to your spouse or a partner why you did what you did have that conversation\nHey honey I'm scared I'm thinking of getting out of the market what do you think\nAnd she'll tell you to go do something else for the afternoon okay it's really that simple but uh\nIf you really do want to know what you should be doing or want to be doing well here's just you know you're always looking for the latest and greatest investment opportunity well here it is I think I'm going to say this was targeted at women that is probably ridiculous the sex thing I'll I'll narrowed down this was targeted to my wife or leave it at that okay\nOn friday a first of its kind ATF\nHas been launched\nNo ATF has ever been launched of this nature before and I got my wife's name all over it it's called the U.S vegan climate ATF [noise]\nI mean give me a break seriously an ATF that is investing in companies according to guidelines consistent with vegan ism\nExcluded or companies as activities quote directly contribute to animal suffering destruction of the natural environment and climate change according to the perspective\nAnd includes companies and engage in animal testing animal derived agriculture or products the use of animals for sport or entertainment or animal based research in genetic engineering\nIt says that it will select companies based on their environmental impact as well companies engaged in the production and refining of fossil fuels or even the use of fossil fuels for production or excluded\nSo too are companies that negatively impact the environment throughout high carbon footprint or habitat destruction and so on\nUnless the company take steps to mitigate or address those impacts no tobacco toxins defense stocks in the military stocks no companies that contribute to human rights abuses were a child or forced labor no financial firms accounting firms are business service providers would work with excluded companies as well in other words it's not going to invest in anybody anywhere\nHe says we're chowder forced labor no financial firms accounting firms are business service providers to work with excluded companies as well in other words it's not going to invest some anybody anywhere\n'cause there's nothing left rarely seriously the vegan eats\nOkay look here we we got him we [laughter] seriously you're investing for your life savings to provide your own retirement security is really serious thing and it isn't for you know [noise] I really don't think they're gonna be finding very many financial advisors recommending the vegan ATF\nHere's what I Do want to talk about though mentioning financial advisors do you have one I think that maybe perhaps you do and I want to ask you the question\nHow old\nIs your advice or what is your advisors age\nAnd is your advisor working in a solo practice or a very small shop in other words does your advisor work pretty much by himself or herself or part of a larger team 'cause even at the big box brokerage firms like Marilyn and whoever else a UPS and and wells and so on\nThough they might have tens of thousands of advisors in the from each one of them is often working independently alone they got a cubicle and they're doing their thing and they're Cuban they're paying no regard having little contact with the folks in the Cuba surrounding them\n... nobody but that advisor you're dealing with knows anything about you or anything about your investment strategy or anything about the investments that you have in your portfolio only your advisor knows what you're doing and while you were doing it there's no continuity between your advisor and other advisors is that the case with the visor you work with\nAnd that's bad enough if you're working with an advisor because\nBy himself or herself with no network no connection no colleague with whom\nThey share effort that's that's bad enough but it gets even worse if your advisor is say sixty years of age and why do I say that age because that's the average age of financial advisors in this country\nTo a new industries survey from practical perspectives more than half of the nation's advisors will be gone within ten years according to all the latest industry research the average advisor is in their late fifties early sixties in fact there are more financial advisors in this country who are eighty then who are thirty\nThis is an aging industry\nA lot of young folks don't want to get into the investment management business because of its negative reputation and concerns over not being able to make a whole lot of money at it they're going into other businesses like investment banking or law or accounting where they think there's better career opportunities for them there aren't a lot of young folks in this business so the average advisor in this industry is older\nSo I Want to ask you the question is you're focusing on your retirement have you given any thought to your advisers retirement because according to some industry statistics half of all advisors in this nation will be gone within ten years they will have quit or retired\nIs that possibly your advisor and if so what happens to you and your account\nIs even if you retire you need to continue having your money managed right well not just a retirement but through your entire life\nIf your advisors not going to be around who do you turn to you want to make sure your advisor as part of a team part of an organization that has stability but it's going to be here long term to provide the continuity and consistency of the advice and services you've grown to expect\nFrom your advisor so one of the things we love best about are from here at home in financial we've got a hundred and sixty advisors\nThe of the advice of services you've grown to expect from your advisor it's one of the things we love best about are from here at elements in April we've got a hundred and sixty advisors in forty three officers nationwide we work collectively as a team so no one client is dependent on any one individual for the advice and services and quality that they're receiving\nAnd that's what we would recommend for you as well have a conversation with your advisor about their career expectations and plans and make sure their plan is in your best interest I'm Rick Edelman you're listening to the truth about money triple a plane wreck\nOn line at rice dome and dot com click that red button schedule a call\nCan tell us the day in time you want us to call you know voice mail no phone tag will make it simple and easy for you to get the answers information you need for your personal finance [noise]\nAre you in recovery guy portfolio selection at ... dot com [noise]\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nAnd will your income last for the rest of your life\nHi I'm Rick Edelman now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free with their free retirement review\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy you create on your own\nAs I said usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see what strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good\nSo yeah but it is is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what yet this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit out the the growth uh especially I be taking it ten years before I ... for the fall out so\nThere's a lot of room for growth that money\nYeah those ten years yes and so you have to calculate what you would expect as a reasonable rate of return over the next ten years and what kind of investment strategy is ideal in order to achieve that goal or as opposed to the promised pension that the employer is providing so the good news is that fact that the employers promise\nIs a guarantee the employer is saying we will give you this money every month\nFor as long as you live no matter what happens in the market\nBut on the other hand many employers many are both the state as well as private employers are struggling to honor those promises there's a huge pension shortfall in this country as many employer\nPension plans are underfunded and if the employer proves unable to honor its promises\nThen you could be discovering that eerie they're not getting a monthly check or you're getting a lower check than they had originally promised millions of Americans are finding themselves in that situation so you've got to counterbalance the so called safety and guarantee of their check\nVersus their genuine ability to pay that check his promise for the rest of your life\nFor all these reasons Paul I'd recommend that we sit down and go through this over a couple of hours what I'll do is put you on hold now get your phone number not connect you with my colleagues in our Troy office and a sit down and go through the numbers with you and go from there All right I really appreciate giving us a call here on the show today\nThank you wreck that's fall from Troy if you're facing the pension question you don't have to go it alone do appalled did call a professional financial advisor not your neighbor not your friend nothing in the cubicle next to you who's as clueless as you you've never done it before but we've done it thousands of times and we can put our benefit of our experience and expertise to your advantage\nJust do it Paul did call us a triple eight plan wreck 'cause that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nParties to your advantage just do it for the call us a triple eight plan wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nYou know I find Paul's um question really fascinating and really timely because limb road just came out with a study showing that fifty two percent of workers you know so we are talking half of all Americans say they don't know\nHow to translate their retirement savings into monthly income if the very question Paul was asking about his case whether to take a monthly pension or take the money out and turn it into monthly income on his own half of American workers say they don't know how to do that\nI'm not at all surprised that you don't know how to do that because you've never tried to do it before none of us are any good at doing things we've never done before so have you given that any thought at all\nI Know you have given thought to you've given a lot of thought to putting money into your accounts contributing to your retirement plan at work adding to your savings you've been doing that for forty years and you've gotten pretty good at it and\nThat's why you've got as much money as you got but very seldom do people turned upside down or inside out where they say okay I've got this bucket of money I've got these accumulated savings\nHow do I turn that into income\nAnd that's an entirely different question because we have to make sure that we're minimizing our taxes as we do is we need to make sure we're generating enough money\nTo meet our ability to maintain our lifestyle we have to keep pace with the cost of living because inflation makes everything more expensive over time and we want to make sure we don't ever run out of money before we die\nAnd not just our death but that of our spouse as well and ideally\nWe're going to have money left over to leaves a legacy an inheritance for our children and grandchildren that gets pretty complicated and if you don't know how to do it if you've never done it before don't go it alone call us a triple eight plan wreck and let us help you through that\nIt's a big decision to make its massive calculation and you want to make sure you get it right and that's the expertise and experienced that professional financial advisors can provide for you we're happy to help a AAA to plan wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nAnd it's fascinating you know financial education which is really focusing a lot of folks on their retirement you know what it begins much earlier than that and so I'm really excited to remind you\nThat we have in November our first children's book being published Jean and I have written between the two of us ten bucks I've done nine of

had Hurricane Florence and now we've got hurricane Michael and\nWhat I Want to warn you about\nAre scams as a result\nOf these hurricanes Sandra has just introduced an investor alert they're warning folks that you might get an email a text a phone call you might see something on social media from outfits that are cleaning big investment opportunities resulting from the clean up\nAfter these disasters you know we've seen that the devastation\nA big investment opportunities resulting from the clean up after these disasters you know we've seen that the devastation houses torn down buildings destroyed massive flooding requiring intensive repairing rehabilitation\nAnd so you got some scam artist to say hey we just want a contract from the state of Florida and we're going to make billions of dollars and hey\nInvestment us all of this stuff is nonsense the most frequent scams are associated with cleanup and rebuilding efforts they often trumpet breakthroughs in science and technology regarding flood related issues such as contamination and and it's all just nonsense\nIf you come upon and investment opportunity\nRelated to the hurricanes\nThrow those opportunity offers away don't make any investment decision before talking with a professional we can help you evaluate the legitimacy of it\nWe can help you do research into the principals involved to see if maybe they've got black marks on their licensing or what have you so if you come upon an opportunity that looks too good to be true or something that looks appealing call off before you asked callers to Tripoli to plan wreck\nThat's AAA seven five to sixty seven forty to let us evaluated with you and maybe just maybe we'll be able to help you steer yourself away from something that ah there's something you want to stay away from\nBy the way this is not the only kind of scam that's out in the marketplace these days\nThe FCC has just charged a group of Internet marketers for allegedly creating and disseminating rags to riches videos to trick retirees into opening brokerage accounts and trading high risk securities I'm going to give you two words here\nLike having a nice warm code for the winter um [noise]\nYou wear hearing all too but then you have another event coming up in November\nYeah we're having a second time I've ever had in ... records Bill Maher rational thought about that [noise]\nWell I Hope you guys can come on down and join us to stay for lunches while at most is\nBy decree air I end up with the bill one of the seven five and twelve sixteen W ... birthday wish I would try\nSaturday mornings with Rick Edelman on W. H. B. [noise]\nFucking back to the rich element show and I told you in the last segment I'd answer the question the nice people finish last\nOh my goodness apparently they do according to study in the journal of personality and social psychology\nYeah there's apparently a journal called the journalist personality and social psychology they are just done research based on data from three million participants over a twenty five year period and they discovered that nice people\nAre at greater risk of bankruptcy than people who aren't nice\nGo figure and the reason\nIsn't necessarily because people are nice it's because nice people according to study don't value money as much as people who are mean\nAgreeable illness was associated with financial hardship lower savings higher debt and higher default rates on loans so\nBeing a nice guy means you're probably in an effort to be nice or just because you're nice you tend not to\nCare as much about money and therefore you are at higher risk of money mismanagement according to the study their data included following individuals over twenty five years and they discovered that when they measured agreeable mess in childhood\nIt predicted greater financial hardship later in life\nSo mom and dad looking your five year olds are they nice or are they not nice because if they're nice [noise]\n...\nI I don't I don't even know what the advice as I Would give them so we are supposed to teach our children not to be nice I just I don't think so but maybe maybe maybe what we should be simply doing is saying look we know you're a nice person\nThat's fabulous that's wonderful but recognize that that could cause you buy your nature to make decisions that aren't helpful to you when it comes to your money management you might be willing to loan money to a friend\nAnd not care if they pay you back because you're nice don't do that\nYou might be willing\nFor a friend and not care if they pay you back because you're nice don't do that you might\nBe willing to buy a bigger house than you can afford because it's the\nIt's nice it's a fun thing to do and later you will discover that you struggled to repay that loan and your default rate will rise so don't do that maybe you'll spend money that you shouldn't be spending on credit cards what have you leading to default on loans or ultimately bankruptcy\nCap maybe counts are kids that being nice is a handicap to effective money management as opposed to telling our kids to you know not not be so nice does anything this world needs is more nice people right you know\nHey it all comes down to financial wellness and here's good news\nFinancial wellness programs in the workplace or on the rise Ninety One percent of employers pretty much all of them say that they are likely to expand their programs over the next year or two in financial wellness and it's a really good thing because thirty three percent of workers one out of three\nSay that their level of debt\nIs ruining their quality of life would you say that is your level of debt ruining your quality of life the average debt is twenty eight thousand dollars and one out of three workers say that they're suffering with this one out of three workers\nSay that they worry about their money several times a day at work\nForty seven percent say they spend more than our of their work time\nDealing on their personal finances in other words they're basically ripping off their boss instead of doing their jobs they're handling their personal finances half of American workers say that they're doing this spending an hour or more at work per month\nOn their personal finances forty three percent say they would be more productive at work if they weren't so worried about their personal finances\nAnd in fact this raises increase costs of absenteeism people missing work because they're dealing with money issues or a relatively new phrase you might not be familiar with not just absenteeism but present ... what's that\nMeans you are at work you showed up your presence but that's about it you're not doing any work\nPresident ... is as costly to an employer as absenteeism according to this research Twenty one hundred bucks per year per employee\nIs what absenteeism in prison to use them costs your employer and if the employer spending Twenty one hundred bucks a year per employee on these costs that's Twenty one hundred bucks a year they can't give you and pay and benefits because they have to spend the money elsewhere\nAnd here's the worst part forty one percent say they're stress level related to money has increased over the last twelve months has yours I mean we've got a stock market has been rising an economy that's been growing unemployment that's been falling wage growth that's been rising\nAnd yet for out of ten Americans say their stress level as compared to a year ago so if yours is up if your financial stress level is up\nOne good news your employer is probably aware of it

your career and the workplace I Want to ask you a question\nAt work do you feel like a fake if you do\nYou're not alone it's called imposter syndrome that was first defined in Nineteen Seventy eight by a couple of psychologists and in a recent survey of employees at Facebook Amazon apple and Microsoft nearly sixty percent of employees say they feel like frauds\nThe study showed that highly successful people despite their degrees there scholastic honors their high scores on standardized tests their professional recognition from colleagues and respected authorities\nSixty percent of them consider themselves to be in posters\nIn two thousand eleven the international journal behavioral science found that Seventy percent of American workers experience imposter syndrome at some point in their lives I'm here to tell you\nYou don't need to feel that way your boss hired you because of your ability to do the job you are performing\nYou do have the ability to do this you don't need at all to feel like a fake if it's holding you back\nI encourage you to talk with someone who might be able to address this issue it's a key psychological miss firing that is affecting an awful lot of American workers and maybe could be holding you back into your career without you realizing\n[noise] imposter syndrome\nI work at home and you're listening to the truth about money triple a plan wreck on line at rice Stillman dot com [noise]\n\nWith a founder of one of the nation's largest independent assessment advisory coming up on our Rick Adelman show [noise]\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself and will your income last for the rest of your life\nHi I'm Rick Edelman now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free without free retirement review\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy and set of sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional percent\nSo work longer so that you are saving more your investments can grow more in value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise might have exactly right\nBut lose the only one other asset that's left that a lot of people I think ignore and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\nOh I just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer\nUm you're right for many people their houses their largest ... outside of the wealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and a tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer and going forward or the difficulty\nIt's and a tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer going forward or the difficulty here is the mechanism is they're\nThey're basically three ways to do it one you can sell your house and go buy a cheaper house\nAnd it has to be a cheaper house not a smaller house because a lot of people sell their house in the ... suburbs moved to the city and it costs just as much if not more fun and so it has to be a cheaper house that's one way to go the other is a reverse mortgage but there are so complicated to many people you need to have\nCounseling before you get one um and so\nSomehow we have to make them simpler and better the alternative to a third way is in Massachusetts we're talking about property tax to for all and so that would be a program where by people sixty five and over could defer their property taxes for um the period until they sell the house or die and\nThen those property taxes would be repaid with interest at that time you don't get as much out of that approach is you could get on in terms of fried up um money as you went out from a reverse mortgage but it could be a much simpler um program\nSo the whole concept of the by not having to pay your property taxes annually that reduces your expenses and you present the cash you can use for other elements of your life so\nThat's right in Massachusetts property taxes we have this high property tax states so for the average household is about four thousand dollars a year but not having to fork out that four thousand dollars can make a a\nBig difference yeah so it's a demonstration that there's no shortage of great ideas and strategies for people but they just need to learn what these are\nMost folks are financially illiterate as you well know and so they don't know what they do know and why I'm a big fan of course being a financial advisor that people turn to a financial advisor for help in dealing with these kinds of issues\nAre and why it's so important for policymakers to pay attention to the environment going on right now because we're facing the problems with Social Security and the trust one being depleted over the next decade or two and why it's important for Congress to act right now or what message would you give\nTo Congress should they be listening to this program about the current situation and the ... for them to act\nSo I think it's a three stage um\nProgram one we as you said we should fix Social Security this is the backbone of the retirement system ought to make people scared that they're not going to have any retirement benefits because the trust fund is Austin is just cause unnecessary Hangst\nThe second thing we should do is make four one K. plants which is what most people have\nWork as well as possible we my view would be that any four one K. plan would have to have automatic provisions so that you'd be automatically enrolled in the program\nUm that you're the default contribution rate for automatic enrollees would be sat at a reasonable level let's say six percent and then automatically increased each year up to let's say ten percent\nUm I think that we need some kind of a way to transform that\nA pile of money into an income stream starts at Fayette providing income at let's say eighty five if you take a snapshot of the workforce at any moment in time half the workers don't get any type of retirement plan coverage at work and so we have this huge coverage gap\nAnd that needs to be fixed um\nGet any type of retirement plan coverage at work and so we have this huge coverage gap and that needs to be fixed um the proposals and made and made it federal level have started an auto IRA program that is if your employer doesn't\nProvide a retirement plan they have to automatically enroll you and I are a um the federal government hasn't acted on that\nAnd so the states have really taken the lead and setting up these auto ... program so we need to fix a security make for one case work as well as possible addressed the coverage gap\nAnd then really try to educate people on the importance of considering their houses part of a retirement\nWell I Hope members of Congress are listening to the program right now and maybe we'll send them an audio clip and perhaps the transcripts of a\nBeat them up over the heads action because the clock ticking the population is aging and the situation is getting worse as we go so that that's Alicia Munnell who is the director of the Boston
