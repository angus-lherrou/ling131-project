us [noise]\nOkay so the FBI report was delivered [noise]\nChuck Grassley Grassley\nSaid hey there's nothing new in this everything in this we knew which was eminently predictable they still haven't the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset\nFolks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate balls the forge testimony they weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate a sweat Nick they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the sevens FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe left is out there but they didn't talk to Dr Ford trunk and Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testified under oath what more can the FBI or do you think the FBI really thinks these people don't change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that\nDr forged testimony changed anyway and in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always 'cause they've talked to Kevin off or how many times from her having a years\nUm but they testified under oath and so the the thing is no reason to talk to them and go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying that I couldn't find anything\nSo I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it and here and it was probably ten minutes ago ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\n\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they've lost because the little CNN report it only looks a little to me he was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this is very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually sounded\nLike a Republican and that presents a problem\nJeff Flake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough report and investigation\nAnd Frank Luntz explains to them why there might be a little backlash occurring not just among them but among people on the right in general and now here is the payoff\nNPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I\nHave been saying has come to pass\nThe capital hearings are back firing big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support or Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm election right now\nI'm so this this is happening and the only\nPrimary change your difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it\nI've even seen stories today among the never Trump or conservative that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\n... well we will we'll see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Wednesday grand found out the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran the operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park I mean he got booed because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people have not lived through Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita\nHill so this was their first and that means it is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen could anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBeen vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been ...\nHe's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence even vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated

believe what she was saying\nI don't know how anybody could honestly Fox\nWithout an I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember where when and why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although ... did the Democrats in that too many really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nominations\n\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they know that there's nothing other than the ... this is all this has managed to all they've got\nIf they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written questions having produced\nWell that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but\nI fought this has been a scam from the get go and if they are all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr forge letter detailing all of this so they ...\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through the time\nWe know that his disposition only unable to restrain his impulse to divide that his mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who he is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senators asked you and\nNumerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this it's who he is he can't help it\nSaturday Sunday gets the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has a behavioral patterns strategically happens it's called pacing and let me briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come\nSetting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford what did he say compelling testimony riveting he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's gone he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's ally ... gone Trump said all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved the Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord so yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue seemed to dump detail with what the swamp things\nBut then\nA few days or are we go by him and the president becomes really is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it had something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr forge shaky uncorroborated provable test them on the drive by is we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nBut because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said in the process the drive buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving the vapors gave me the vapors on my got Trump is always uses horrible ... remain he's not ...\nWhat Donald Trump did recounting\nThe absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\n\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony the drive by media did not report on on the none of the corroborate shouldn't being possible\nThey did not tell their audiences that the four people foreign place them a room with her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks other than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying that\nPeople watch the mainstream media had no idea that the four witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends drive by it's we're not reporting any of that the drive buys were reporting what the Democrats\nReporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned a woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets it on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth\nAbout Dr Christine Ford and her full of holes testimony think of a million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterize that for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and man and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\n\nDetailed it for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if\nWe had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people\nAt these protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democrats senators haven't told them only Trump did\nIt's another reason why they hate it but we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea of all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story now they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that\nAnd the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying no\nCorroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump sense that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump or his go literally insane\nBut if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump didn't say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report\nWe couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democrat senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\n\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a\nSense we humans

I mean when I say it's all there it is I mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but it's the book of acts it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament eat pistols as the\nIntroductory guide here to get people who want to read the Bible but they're intimidated by it to actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start and you'll be more likely to stay with it\nIt\nDetails the suffering and the sorrow the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures\nIn Christianity following the death and resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which if the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity\nExist and and\nThat's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically\nPut your arms around that resurrection from the dead but\nIt's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal talk show host really ... you really believe that camp you that's why you people are not you can't really think that somebody died and came back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell\nFor Christianity to be what it is that had to happen\nAnd my brother David is a\nDevoted to helping people believe that it happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it look it's it's not simply a primer it's its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction to the Bible\nInto Christianity both tests limits but this focus is on the book of acts because that's where it all is now don't\nRead the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the book X. that's why they chose the book of acts to start this so and I I again I I think you ever given I mean it's not imagine us it would not be a timely\nTimely at any time in the next two or three days because of all the other news happening out there but again it's Jesus as residents just hit on

that Kavanaugh had a hundred and fifty people talk to seven investigators and giving and nothing about her\nI Can't dispute any of that that in fact that's a great point that is an\nAbsolute great
