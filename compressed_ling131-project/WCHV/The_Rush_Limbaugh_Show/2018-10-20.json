campaign Trump came down the escalator\nThree years ago June of two thousand Fifteen the media has been telling us and noted the experts in the Washington establishment have been telling us that it's Trump just got a self destruct\nSomething's gonna happen a drug is going to blow up and everybody's going to see who the real Trump is and everybody is going to be shocked and surprised and saddened

right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit improved the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats\nAnd all of these house races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks they're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of them are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them\nBut they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought it was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\nWell nicknamed it when he was on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year we're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand six team comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... wake and the Democrats the comeback\nShow up and re take everything they lost well the problem with that is the Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race\nDemocrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democratic party\nThat much worse bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the spending to energize that then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along ... there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy was uh\nEr and all of the spending the energized but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along ... there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns the Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know harder when Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did\nExcept they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component development twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they remember half to two thousand to the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump and\nA hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for each hairstyle hatred because it'll be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us Oscars this massive Democrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave\nPlus Trump is uniting the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver life here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance\nThat one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd might this for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous so she can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen a split like this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate he's never seen anything like that you know I don't know how to do this\nAnd we consider it a toss up it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's kind of I guess he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen in this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent and the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around\nAnd their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had a splitting the forecast like there's pretty good news a\nLot of things wrong usual this time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it\nTo predict the likelihood of a split is unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenties on in both places that makes me nervous meaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats\nWhen the house and makes me nervous\nEighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes him nervous we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really there's no chance of Democrats win the Senate\nOn on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance at one of those two productions that could be wrong\nWell there is a pretty good indication that Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how he doesn't know he's nervous is\nAdel is selling if it's eighty
