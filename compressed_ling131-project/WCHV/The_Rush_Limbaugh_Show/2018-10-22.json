Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd look we continued to\nA close the more you got to stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims\nIt continued to close the border\nYou gotta stop about this asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow lower your nose Jeff Sessions he keeps DVD I talked to Louis and he'll talk about Japanese talking to Jeff and I don't even know who his toys and who you're talking\nWith Jeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nWho think that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage of the American people will realize their mistake electing trumpet of Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argued against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason the two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and\nPut Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got maybe a narratives that a gigantic blue way it was going to happen and we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began\nTo look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's on poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly\nDon't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I eat election day people have to start reeling in these mad and kept for ... projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who would hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWith a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see\nIt as a blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get the poll result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\nThere is no way\nIs simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive land\nPolitical party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there at the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there there's the hungry we we we have so much they have so little\nWe mark what the that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had an amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump ... never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum truck would have never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing to report are coming from ... countries let them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe beat it is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\n\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\n\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\n\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan trying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd that's just not where the American people are one
