[noise]\nSo I just checked my email up public email account which I Do often sometimes during the break [noise]\nAnd uh I found one of the subject line is how I find these dear Mr Limbaugh I disagree with your assessment of what this election is about\nThe main voting issue is not immigration or health care is is that the Democrats voting base is a bunch of nuts\nI Wish that were true I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity\nThe psychological disorders and I mean that with every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters being psychologically\nScrewed up they are suffering psychological disorders because of things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country for it they want to blame the patriarch and they want to blame the founding but then they they they claim that the only fix for it\nIs the government punishing the people that did whatever happened to these people\nAnd the Democratic party has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd has tried to normalize them all\nBy enshrine ing them as policy planks in the Democratic party platform if you will\nAnd that's how we ended up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving a whole weight of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which the otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have tried to ever ... even before but it's civically since the Kavanaugh hearings to make the point that that's what we're up against and that's what it's going to end up trying thing and winning if the Democrats win the house all of that abnormality is going to achieve power at when they have the\nPower to actually implement their forms of punishment against groups of\nPeople they blame for whatever was wrong in their lives\nThese are not people that think they can fix things themselves they're not people that they've not been raised this way the Democratic party does not promote that kind of thing in human behavior Democratic Party is happy\nTo help them blame others happy to make them think they have no hope that the deck is stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity their race\nIs stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity\nTheir religion whatever Democrat Party is helpful in making all these people believe they are justified in thinking\nThat life is miserable because of all these horrible other people do what they've done to them and then the Democratic party to let us fix it for you we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and the\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examine every Democrat constituency group that they've been representing the last take your pick ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy\nHave had their issues addressed and fix or are they as miserable as they've always been are they is

I voted for Trump I'm an avid Trump voter and them America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question your ... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi\nArabia and Israel how can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty with all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody\nWhen Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back on harmed and we said screw you you know where your benefactor old spy on us and I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spike us we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd particularly when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with because your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that\nIt was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it have to do with it what what I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly\nIs an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this I said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam and that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shaped case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out\nAnd being a radical uh inventor of various\nAspects of Islam as part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he started\nReading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he he told me was so\nWhen you didn't realize that the Saudi royal family\nIs in charge of\nWhen you didn't realize that the Saudi royal family\nIs\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and Medina Medina I found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islam comes from ...\nFrom those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence ... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting\nThem into suicide\nBombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi\nRoyal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world\nPromoted while hobby is and that's what I went back to Mr Buckley is I I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin ... Mohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and\nIts relationship to Islam all the cause of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars of federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places and other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is\nThe\nI don't know what word abandonment orange me a distance thing for more hobbies\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show me again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\n\nWith the ... this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different why they've got kids with it\nIt was family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives saw Saudi kingdom could have twenty sons\nHow do you determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe winning edge of the crown prince the air's end in what\nOrder\nThen saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it the widow of his true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as ground friends\nNow many people think that this is up to the king the king determines what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case\nSo all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cab you got all these plans for reform\n... burger the smartest way to iron\nTied for pre today that zip recruiter dot com slash free that zip recruiter dot com slash free\nComing right now we're getting into the big wave a fabulous fall of ants come into your flu county library\nDue to in friday morning story time for the little ones free movies of all kinds every Friday for the kids even no school today movies like Madison winner reading programs for kids teens and adults\nWe'll get down to write on over to your fabulous live an accounting\nAnd accounting book sales starts November\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard sees ill\nSeven five and am twelve sixteen do these shows [noise]\nWC HP time two o'clock ...

Britain has been all aimed at stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen these done too much into little time\nOh I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we had independent budget deals if we had and then there's not\nAnd we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for\n\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction in there for his theory was that the Democrats\nAre trying to demonstrate that is never going to happen and Trump doesn't even care than it ain't\nGoing to happen\nAnd what better way to illustrate isn't four thousand people storming the border and not being\nStopped ah let's see grabs town\nBy number four team Nikki Haley she went to the Al Smith dinner in New York last night we own

last night she said the\nIn America in domestic politics we do not call our political opponents evil and of course\nThe real\n... ... well who else does but Trump he calls the press evil\nAnd the Democrats evil and so it's that comment that that made people think aha she's she's actually going forcing him to go for the Republican nomination at some point maybe not twenty twenty twenty twenty
