front of a camera I don't know what type of man it takes to cut throat to somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably were rich rear end about having waterboarding his base\nShe'd never believe her second year we're going to kill it no let me tell you he would use his fingers to count the number of seconds because he knew that in all likelihood we would stop at ten it's doesn't sound like a person Who's Afraid of dying\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile de ... telling me it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a\nDemocracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want\nThis guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in the history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on them you know they'd be says he's going to do something he's going to\nDo it or die trying we don't have a war yet but not for lack of trying and we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of\nNot for lack of trying other Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read burst issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of a sudden\nTrump wants to once again take away health insurance from people with preexisting conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican wants this is the reason the Republicans didn't go for a full repeal of Obamacare as pre existing conditions\nWhich you get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being covered is not even insurance there is no way you can get insurance if your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell your insurance wants to houses on wire or after it's been robbed\nSo we're not even talking about insurance but we are\nAs far as the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house and the Senate wants to take away health insurance or preexisting conditions when did this happen\nNo Republicans out there saying that it's sort of like when Joe ... a ... a joint stuff Annapolis was interviewing um ah well questioning Mitt Romney in a debate and he asked and you think that states should be able to ban contraception Romney look the rest of what\nNobody is talking about that stuff and I I don't care for that he's talking about what I think ... states I'm a right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what we're not talking about George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling\nYou states will eventually Romney answered it and it didn't\nMatter what the answer was it allowed the media Renee discusses states banning contraception [laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women\nWas reborn and that's what this pre existing condition garbage let me see what the real issue with the real\nIssue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about is immigration illegal immigration that remains the issue that color lessons\nRevolt Republican voters no matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested in terms of being a very helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it after ...\nThey're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions are Leslie stall here trying to do the same thing by suggesting that\nTrump is hostile to our good friends in Europe it's just you sound so hostile why what you want to sound so hostile it's like when she was talking to Jose Jose Roderick why would you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so I mean that's not who we are so you're so hostile and Trump said what is hostile\nThe way they treated us is what's hostile we're not hostile\nShe says yeah but you can't deal with it without he says we have been the stupid country for so many years and that you find that you're willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO humid all the sudden this interview secretary of defense\nTrump's that I Know more about NATO than matter does [noise] [laughter] [noise] I don't work man is as far as the deep state is concerned yes NATO\nYes NATO any\nArmy general wouldn't be NATO Trump\nJust [noise] as Vanity Fair magazine says and it's surprising admission sixty minutes\nWas out matched by Trump the

part of an administrator ... already seen its head and get plenty of free promotion during rallies broadcast on cable news\nAnyway they go on to crash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them to just continue to dominate\nWith real lent lists rhetoric CBS let Trump get away with the same kind of persona and the same kind of stuff that\nHe says as he says\nAt his rallies they say Leslie stalls interview with Trump was an undeniable get\nHe'd been scarce on mainstream media since around that time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt and NBC and indicated he'd fired call me in part due to the Russia investigation but the interview seemed governed by two motives both of which played in the hands of a media savvy president\nWho's refusal to play by typical rules of engagement has been at the center of his rise [noise] you know you people in the meeting and\nSay oh you want he's been the most media accessible president you've ever had this guy will stop and talk to your wherever your gathered if he's on the way somewhere and sees you he stops and talks to you and he tells you exactly what he thinks\nIt's not his fault if you can't keep up with it it's not his fault if you can't\nPlay your usual journalists games and dominate him and get away with re characterizing what he says looks like or thinks\nVanity Fair is just admitting either they're

millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want it and did you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice forming into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it in a Heritage Foundation are actual report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station controversy if it was all part of a global warming craze\nIn the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding the left went\nFatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chop down trees and we haven't replaced them to make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I\nOut you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is the wood industry they need one right after you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree that's cut down for a new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to what that didn't\nCompute they couldn't begin to fathom that they couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of tree is to build a bunch of houses or whatever and that's that was trees that were gone forever why they don't want to cut down the redwoods that ever come back you know\nI'm the same token I remember saying it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forested acres in America today\nThan there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green them is going to raise and sea level I sent its like ice in a glass\nMelting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes\nBeing jumped into the ocean and not going to raise ... you're crazy it's crazy it's ... you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise ...\nNo it doesn't get a glass eyes and for some water in it filled up Philip Glass in ice put as much ice in there as you can and filled up with water I still going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\nIt will not the volume is the volume at a bunch of ice chunks\nFalling off a glacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about they thought you know what you're ... you're not a scientist you can see this\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing and if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland melt and have the ice follow what would you do to make that happen to think about what\nWould

were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over\nWas it was\nIt was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial and but during the
