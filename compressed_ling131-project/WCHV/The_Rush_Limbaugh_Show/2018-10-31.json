actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country then and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly\nThe immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you had to promise that you were going to do your best to learn the English language\nIf it was restricted because it was predicated and based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here the world was not in title

day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat\nUm he was one of the first in his wedding of the first to ah to go to college it became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity to\nManned spaceflight landing on the motives saw it all\nAnd I remember I was I was home in Missouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after the program again so they Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety these these uh ... close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big things it was hard of hearing but it's not just couldn't\nHere to radio easily so one of the big thing is being discussed on your program say immigration we called him pop pop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all and back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days of Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to ... new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people with his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundred the controversy of them was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration there were people who are opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what her said today\nThe differentiating thing today is that the legal immigration is seldom even discussed\nAnd we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial\nThing immigration and how we manage it\nIdea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nAnd the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources\nWe've gone around the world and take and what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and salt in liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be poor out there\nAnd so therefore the American people are guilty of something\nThat was an unequal distribution of wealth the laps as in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion\nAnd the real purpose behind it is to transform America in two kinds of nation it was never intended are found it to be and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but\nThe idea that illegal immigrants have legal claim on whatever they want in this country that's that is what's new and the education they make so many young people think that that's just the thing is also relatively new [noise]\nThe
