at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out the Latino Z are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans and anybody know according to recent polling data that Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is anti\nIllegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think what that's about as voter turnout and she mentions that here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and

old thing happens they don't show up in the numbers that everybody expects them to she's suggesting that that may be the case here the Democrats and failed to light a fire\nUnder the Latino thing bothered him at what the Latino think what that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are stunned that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue\nFor Trump and the Republicans and it is it is the issue every Republican running for office either incumbents or running for the first time needs to be focusing on this issue there is

News\nUncertainty over a blue wave NBC News fine Democrat and G\nThat is to make it their NBC News [noise]\nUncertainty over a blue wave NBC News fines Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there\nDuring the whole big voter registration drive out there that Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it\nPossible that democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much excitement there so much motivation there so much inspiration that nothing can hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that\nSomething that's not a blue\nWave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline is that in certain they over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity from twenty four team to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put\nThese numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture of registration for those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what\nThat's all you need and um if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it that seems like a little hope will we don't have all fooled database of numbers for do those and they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] [noise] so how can this be how can voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake\nThen a column from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying to help\nThe Democrats who she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans\nHeadline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if there is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it or or Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody\nLike Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing\nThat indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks that want to read they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the garden yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think\nThe report says every member they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years daddy reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nIn their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump Russia collusion happen so Mueller's report is Randy\nOf American voters believe the Trump Russia collusion\nHappens so Mueller's report is ready to be released soon create the impression that it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the midterms I'm just going to tell you if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the election they're not going to want this out before the midterms\nYou imagine the let down that would be you don't know you don't know how many of your\nBase common ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be stunned that the number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it\nLike gospel despite all realm of common sense despite every\nBit of knowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball Z Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe\nIt's mandates they believe that if they are told before them in terms that the smaller report doesn't have this evidence and will not lead to President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\n\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump as an incompetent as a boob who are endangered the United states electoral system\nWith his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence stupidity but I don't think there's going to be any evidence of it and the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out\nBefore them in terms I could be wrong only have to wait and see it won't be

Hi\nThank you so much Raj I'm just an old white man than here in Huntsville, Alabama who shut up\nThat you won't ... well yeah and so you're you're demonstrating your your arrogant white privilege here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am a really a\nA a oh listen to your to the uh the article from I Believe it was Bloomberg that ah ah that they're going to release the mall or a report or sometimes after the election and ready to that yeah understand\nThat we don't believe that we're not going to believe anything Mahler anyway\nNow that's an interesting point too I mean unless the\nUnless uh he implicate or the or an Obama administration\nAnd Hillary Clinton and the DNC or in a a this investigation in collusion with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the [noise]\nUh I I just don't understand that the drive by media just doesn't get it they're not going to feel as people that voted for Donald Trump\nFrom Donald Trump they don't understand is like a you know the magnificent seven\nUh both guys didn't you know when north guys came up here they and they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were or or or uh you know if they are\nNot lived a a good life they want to somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country of the last uh eight to ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media\nRight now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late\nThat the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is\nUm I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could they would the icing on the cake I think their primary objective now is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party that as a combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is on joining up a\nFirst time participation\nUm and that's why if this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger so that's why I think\nThat they have strategic may become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans of hate Trump\nI I think they they do move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they could make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing the news as I Do\nMore and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave\n\nAnd there are some big rush don't foreign producer during this on purpose or sucking you when they're making you think they are given up they're making you think they're trying to disappear you know trying to make you think you got it in the back no they're not going to ever\nPull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have a media wide threw out the entire\nLeft wing media universe a disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if if I ended up being wrong Soviet I'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it\nBut it is I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco in Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to\nIt like the total repeal of Obamacare but they have not been able if you you would think of all of these things were true I've known people hate Trump regret their vote a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is ... ... the ... wouldn't be getting any\nAll of these things were true a lot of people hate drop regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal\nOpposition to it if the Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it but I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence\nOver the place the Democrats are Ross didn't fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nYou a couple of with their their mentality but says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary what a one in the first Trump would have never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag into thousands sixteen and they were revved an energized too there was one of the talk of Democrats not turning out back then
