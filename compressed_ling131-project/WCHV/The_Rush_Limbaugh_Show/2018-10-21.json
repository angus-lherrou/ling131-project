network we talked last week about the interesting nature of the schedule this week kind of a week and a half\nSo to speak you'll actually get that twice you are trying to get some ... some younger guys that you and you only do on the by week how did how did that go in and who stood out to your during that process\nWell it wasn't really well I I enjoy the challenge of the schedule you know it's um it's always kind of fun um to try and craft a schedule you know figure out what you want to get better out or what you need to emphasize and then\nCraft to schedule it gives you a chance to do that it was um I did not feel like we could totally just turn the page and say we're going to go good versus good and really work on getting better because of the nature of our opponent or what the triple a chip option in Georgia Tech so we gave the kids a couple of days off and then\nBrought him back on Wednesday and Wednesday and Thursday really had to separate practices essentially for an hour we worked on Georgia Tech with our older guys and then\nWe basically split the team and a half we took the older guys are the guys that are playing a lot I shouldn't say older guys are getting a lot of wraps\nAnd put them sent them to the weight room to kind of go get feeling better\nAnd the left of the guys that aren't getting as many reps out on the field and and got some good individual time with them and got to work um some good versus good and and try and get guys wraps and and they did a good job with it you know they embraced that opportunity you know so many of those\nThose guys have been running plays off of cards either defenses are often says and for them to get back into our own system and get to run 'em that stuff was was really good I was I was pleased with our effort and intensity jailing Griffin do good jobs are kind of the first guy that comes to my mind on the defensive side of the boys and young guy that's\nGot to continue to improve is filled it a little bit force on special teams and been ready and prepared [noise]\nUm and then a good job and then we got um some good work for are too young quarterbacks you know some some good settled on seven work and some good team worked for both Quincy and tend to\nGo you're at the halfway point in the season the if you had like a top three did you say we'd better fix on do you want to get better and all phases but if you had like a top three or four things do we need to fix or we're going to be in trouble for the last stretch of the season what would it be well\nYou know I don't know the thing for us is can we just continue to focus on improving can we can\nLast stretch it to see what would it be well you know I don't know the thing for us as we just continue to focus on improving can we continue to find ways to do run the ball you know we set up to do on the office of side of the ball was\nDefeat press coverage because it gave up so much problems so many problems last year\nAnd we've really done a great job of that or we don't even get it any more I'm sure we'll get it come I'm ... week but we really have the last several weeks teams or even tried to do that so it's kind of shifted our focus now of playing underneath and how can we manufacture some big players because\nWe had some of those big place with ... coverage now we're trying to get\nSo big plays with Lew's career so you know offensively is continuing to find a way to be more consistent run into football and then now finding ways to get\nBig plays worked into to what we're trying to do defensively of a ... against the

Sunday night thanks for finding us as the huskies had it in to the resumption of their season Thursday night they take on Georgia Tech at seven thirty more information as it pertains to the broadcast\nComing up coach Georgia Tech week though it comes on a Thursday both teams coming off a by so that of course even itself out as you look at his match up there's obviously always the differences that come in because of the style that they play how I view of all in terms of approaching that not only from a schedule perspective but going into the game as well [noise]\nKnow weren't hurt us last year was a couple of big passes and you know you take one step in the wrong direction without truly being down there on your ... and then there's the guy running down the field and these guys will take their shots now they\nUm obviously they don't throw the ball um the number of times if as most teams but they do take their shots I mean they're going to um you know try and try and hurt to try and had shown on big plays with guys running down the field so\nMaking sure you're disciplined in in that area and then when you when you've got the ball you've got to continue to be a fish it you know you may\nYou may have fewer possessions or you may have a little bit less time because of the nature of what you're playing against and you just got to make sure that you're you're on top of things\nIt's such a luxury for them when they got a quarterback like they have in Marshall and he's been around so long it seems like that you still dynamic so dangerous [noise] it really is the explosive\nAthlete that can throw the ball and her to throw that but you know can really wrong and you know really looks comfortable run in the scheme is not afraid to give the ball and you can get the ball out there to the perimeter be accurate with pictures well under duress\nAnd you know one of the things I don't know that gets talked about enough playing quarterback in the system is a tough and does it takes I mean those guys they they get to ... not knocked out of them sometimes and um you know to continue to get up and go call the next play and execute takes takes and toughness\nAs you look at it the other side and coach we've talked a lot about trying to maximize your possessions how do you balance trying to do that officially but also staying aggressive enough to take some of your um ...\nWell I just I don't think you can make too much of it you've got a call the game and game playing the game the way that you know it you know I think you need to stress to your kids the importance of it but it's important every week but I just you know I don't think you can I don't think you should fall into the trap of doing too much but I Do think educating people understanding\nBecause what you don't want to do is you don't want people to get frustrated if they're standing on the sidelines for a little while waiting for their next opportunity you know that's that's the mindset you don't want to fall into that can lead to pressing at times I think understanding\nHow the game may look going into it and then doing your best to go execute as the best way to approach and\nWe've seen not ... he'll get more and more playing time is that something will continue to see more and more of obviously is kind of got a good grasp of things well I think\nThey're doing is continuing to get better and so is that acts and that's a good thing for us in the future of our defense and and and currently so um you know taxes becoming a a better player on special teams is taking a tremendous amount of pride is getting a bigger role there\nAnd you know is is getting a bigger role on the defensive side of the ball will see how those things go or certainly not unhappy with dealing with those guys are are kind of pushing each other to be better which is helping us\nI'm helping us all along or\nAnd but those guys are are kind of pushing each other to be better which is helping us I'm helping us all along or\nDid you notice ... maybe have a leg up in terms of preparation this week having played against this system pretty much every day in high school yeah he's\nSeen it all and you know it's a little bit different deal but to hear him say you know he's got it all figured out you know but\nThat's just that you know but he's a sharp kid and he does have some familiarity with what's going on and then our trying to do to defend it and what our responsibilities are you always is even taken taken up you know working a boat or tried to alert both alive
