Graham laid out but instead\nIt was a standalone Graham said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican\n\nAnd saw grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats\nWas followed by agreement with Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI being allowed to do one way but it has to get their fight mellow fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're gonna have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it uh we shared it with your way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nLindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was Lindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way did you notice\nLindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of them even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care when they got a rise out of them was when Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys we know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr journal we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation ha well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to invest some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired of because all they are further\nAway\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible enters the Nile\nHow why if that's so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out cabin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held a pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again\nThen the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get some checked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital or they don't want to imagine that happening there on can there are going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is not\nConfirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad you feel betrayed because if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority and we couldn't get confirmed you need to come out and vote for us how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen\nWas not sworn in as everybody thinks that what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness to Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nVoters are going to remember in November is this\nThe unfairness to Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there\nWere guaranteed to get their votes you're going to and there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Kevin all and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe that majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all of us Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side of going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump\nTrump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to turn a Kavanaugh defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and the house I don't know how they do it vote for us Kevin ... was defeated\nVote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here in San rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see how skunks they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here was cabinet so Kammen on doesn't make it isn't going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me you ought to be the other way around\nThis is another trick\nI think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up you have an odd doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush [noise] voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what the guy got railroad railroaded in our guys couldn't stop it and when we're supposed\nTo say well okay man we're really loaded now that's going to cause that turn up\nTo ... I'm Sorry folks that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's going to happen is that voters are going to be out there saying\nEven what we voted Republican Democrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other one got\nWin this we have got to be the Democrats not lose to them and by the way\nIt's got to be the other way that the way that we have got to be the Democrats not look to them\nBy the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of ah people who think\nTheir expert political analyst and they all\nAll not all but I mean a whole bunch\nOf them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired we want to let them destroy a great life great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win the midterms how does that work\n\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nWhereas it when they win that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team why do we have to keep losing to fire up our base you talk about a trap\nYou asked me in the media is behind that the Democrats a Washington establishment I got to take a break be back after\nRight now we've got a home out there that we just completed the foundation starting framing and we've also working with some of our existing homeowners to do projects that they've been contemplating for the first move them whether finishing a basement down below an addition or some other way to personalize their history [noise]\nWe used to check us out they can even look at the website profit ridge dot com or they can on the community website through our dominion customs dot com and of course there's always Facebook our phone numbers or\nYour invited to the muddy boots tour October sixth and seventh that profit ridge from two until four pm get all the details that dominion custom home states will pay\nNews first from the PGA network studios do these\nSome jobs are similar WC H.
