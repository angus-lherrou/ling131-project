Florida Panhandle it isn't true there had been all kinds of major hurricanes\nThat hit the Florida Panhandle uh experts have studied\nThe sediment and lake and river sediment and have found that hurricanes probably hit this region a thousand years ago when nothing was there and nobody was there\nA there is certainly nothing there to damage there was a a hurricane hits in a similar location back in Nineteen oh six wiped out everything for immobile Panama City but there wasn't much to wipe out there wasn't much infrastructure that so it's it's it's crazy to start comparing financial

is a hundred percent mega go Trump and nobody talks about it and it's almost like you know we went for about it like ... are are you okay with Trump oh\nYes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state if the regime was listening to him and so you're basically this driving describing the same thing the difference\nIs that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot leader\nSo you you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in charge but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not call attention themselves Frank\nConcerned about violence is shared let me grab somebody's number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox and friends today and uh it was only easily Earhart uh so you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is is somebody who's going to get killed someone almost do it I was there at the ball field when Stevens\nOf this rhetoric your fear is that somebody is going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died from a very very angry violent man who is inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough\nWhen he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... he was yelling [noise]\nThis is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket but he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence\nThere is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down\nAnd I think the other side needs to really calm the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to take place the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\n\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think\nThat this in ... unhinged behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative\nOf of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger and the un has behavior justified on the basis of the trumpet so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nThere's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little it'd be more responsible\nThey don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of on the hinged I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know better when I many times can you call 'em insane or not riot or mentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value\nIn these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building and confronting people in the elevators and basically frightening the\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes\nTo get done what they need to get done but don't don't think that they're going to get a dose\nSensibility or responsibility and ask for it to be dialed back and part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of unleashing misbehavior on themselves\nWhen it's not going to be said Russia ... worth\nPrices for peace building totally genetically windows doors ... attentional
