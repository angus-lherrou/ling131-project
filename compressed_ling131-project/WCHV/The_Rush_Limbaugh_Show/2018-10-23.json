now that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states it\nIs that early voting almost always favors

that the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stole that election from the Democrats have been motivated or like you
