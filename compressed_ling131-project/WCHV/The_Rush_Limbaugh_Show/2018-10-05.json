think\nHer\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger and then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has a this though the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time and the month\nNow\nThat to me it goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving is if it's their time of the month does anybody think that\nWould fly there is no way\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day in that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support enable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in them in terms of the words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populace coalition perceive the way he has been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that the targets of range had somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken\nThese people and fired them back up so she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh\nHas served as a reminder Anna highlight to the people voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from a cabin all by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high now that's\nAgain that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate
