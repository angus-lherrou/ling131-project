descriptions of the house in a place for the people there who all deny it\nUh and the timing of all if you put this whole package together\nIt just [laughter] and the reason for it to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this a spontaneous happenstance [laughter] I don't think Feinstein just received a letter she didn't know it was coming just don't believe it can't prove it\nJust don't believe it I don't believe he's minding your own business one day in a letter from a constituent who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\nWell then\nThere's the ... that it doesn't make any sense unless you put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is\nWhich I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign to withdraw or for Trump to withdraw from I think it was beginning to unravel because Trump and Kevin all have hung in and my unravel I mean be exposed\nFor the phone is

question what's going on with the mother probably here's the latest I heard of the ... the the story actually has a sentence in it the\nSpecial counsel's office and Robert Mueller and third us choir most in\nMost most honest man in the ... what it\nIs shedding prosecutors shedding privacy now when your cat or dog sheds that means they're losing hair a smaller is losing prosecutors meaning their\nTheir their their jobs on those not in their ... their ... their moving away and going off to other\nThings there's less and less for his team of Trump haters to what to do I'll just repeat what I said at the very opening in the program I don't think this tax story would have run today\nIf Mahler we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times\nIf Mueller we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story when the when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left\nAnd nothing happens by accident the times did just finished the story\nBy deadline last night there by making it able to be published they'd been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year and they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the times found it\nHow they reported it how they prompted how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today first reaction I had was a cabinet thing must really be unraveling\n'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle and it's not really new its taxes\nThe latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen something more recent but the last story I saw on this is Muller [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know what to believe in if that Muller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone in an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia\nAnd Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important that enable Trump to hold onto\nHis money and get more But Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty ... you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election because of the impact that it would have and they of\nCourse are ah unbiased ended it totally objective in the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I which is all\nThey've been trying to do it for two years I wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude excoriated for having a really really shady friends and all that but\nDoesn't accused him of anything if it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen is the way these people operate but but maybe it won't\nOutside of that I'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to repeal I don't know what he's going to report 'em ... zero not at all I Know is\nThat the drive by media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the capital story when\nRush Limbaugh appointee mostly on the high net worth\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan really you have a choice and it's a great when
