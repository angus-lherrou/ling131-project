ineffective I'm Talking about only in terms of persuasion and if it ever does work to persuade we probably will never know it one thing I've found throughout my life is when you're when you're targeting people to persuade them\nWho are genuinely on here\nThey haven't gotten over the fact that Trump won they can't get over the fact that they're people can't get rid of Trump\nThe intelligence

for a month yeah you're right and that was the\nOne of the first elements of the of debuting of the program your your memory is really good to remember that\nWell thank you [laughter] I'm calling I wanted to talk about what left is doing with their intolerance\nAnd how that relates to the Saudi journalist ... oh yeah but I first mentioned just ironically given what you less about I happened to be a clinical psychologist in private practice and I am not soon\nYou know people coming into the office falling apart because of Trump\nIt's just not really happening sometimes it gets mentioned in passing\nBut but um it's not really happening and when people mention anything that triggers a stress response\nIt really isn't the the stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to deal with stress because they could they could have problems in any issue money or relationships or something else it's really helped me to get stronger to eat\nOr to build some palaces and to not catch them so presumed to be a little more open minded\nI'm ... I'm not seeing with with some of those people are saying\nWell now wait a minute now are you suggesting that the story is in the political that's the equivalent\nOf something as big as widespread as Washington Post about you suggesting that the story is exaggerated and not that many people are suffering from this ah trumped arrangement syndrome or whatever\nI can tell you that I have an extreme business practice and it's not happening because Trump get mentioned in passing yes so didn't George Bush so they will go rock Obama but usually they were not there they'll never\nKnow but what if your office was on the Upper West side or what if your office was in Georgetown or you know in Hollywood I won't share boulevard what its whopping just falls is not I mean you've got basically ...

for a reason\n[noise] well if someone came to me and they were really really upset about Trump my goal will be to try to help them manage that so they don't say don't fall apart because Trump is not the issue ... they'd be the issue is rarely the trigger unless it's unless it's whew\nThe sheet your being responsible I think the psychiatrist these people are going to see are suffering\nAnd the issue is rarely the trigger unless it's unless it's huge\nThe sheet your being responsible I think the psychiatrist these people are going to see are suffering from the same things I don't really shrinks know how to help them I think the drinks are probably encouraging them that they're justified in feeling this way that Trump is enough of a rubber ... to make anybody feel this way and that's normal\nI can tell you one thing that I'm I'm right of center and I'm In the minority in psychological and psychiatric field\nOh yeah Oh absolutely\nSo that does that bias does bring in someone who is very much a progressive or liberal um they will certainly be affected by what's going on okay\nLet me ask you this I'm a you may not be able to\nTell me this because of a a patient client or a confidentiality I'm not asking the names but what what percentage of the people who are coming to see you for help are in fact\nOut of kilter because of politics not maybe Trump per se or any other personality but just politics in general how many of them are in a state of confusion or stress just because of politics\nI'd say zero percent zero percent yup zero percent that's interesting yeah they're not coming in with for that as the they have other things to do they're worried about you know their families are they're going through a divorce or they have anxiety or depression about other things or they were traumatized [noise] um\nLet's see two liberals all of that is Trump spoiled [laughter] 'cause he got elected and he's president it's all his fault\n[noise] that you know it's it's interesting one of the things that helped me here it's the right was psychology when I was running it because um when people come in my office and that so they have terrible child\nAnd and maybe it's legit they were re mistreated and they were view I can sympathize with an enterprise and I can say that was horrible now we have to do the work of getting past it and continuing to blanket for doesn't help\nAnd having the attitude that somebody else must change in order for me to feel better is backwards we have to be willing\nTo thank you you have just defined liberalism you got that is perfect everybody else must change in order for these people to feel normal and God that's exactly it they force everybody to become what\nThey demand and to love it at the same time\nAh that's I'm Glad you
