they're trying to suppress this they they're not happy\nWith good economic news they're not happy that people's lives are improving they're not happy that there are jobs galore to choose from they're not happy that wages are going up that people are getting bonuses they are not happy\nThat more people are working there they're not happy the economy is growing to the point of um storming all the

think whatever arguments we're having here they are still all circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of

take our time impeaching Trump by so\nThis is all predicated of course on the fact that the Democrats are going to win the house and I guess the Senate because if the Republicans hold the Senate
