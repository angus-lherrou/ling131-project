operative\nAnd the mob tactics haven't worked\nAnd in fact if you're a reasonable Democrat operative when you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob action\nCould be hurting

zero to eat I beat network we don't want to go too far down this road I Do know that people want to weigh in it or wait in on on the phones and we'll get some of that in right now starting in Atlanta

every day there should be like a you know just talking to a buddy\nI guess that's true yeah I'm I'm also married to the golf pros and cons of friends here in Atlanta so um what I wanted\nTo melt

me take a swing it didn't look good he just great guy I'm impressed I'm really impressed with his unique fellow so I feel like I I feel like I Do know you\nSee I had to tell you that that like we had a connection um but when I Want to say the I heard you say last week you know there's two weeks to them that time let's see what happens and here we go I mean I'm not saying couldn't happen at somebody didn't\nPut those bonds out but the chances of sticks bombs being put out for us as yesterday nine and gotten a and I don't even know if they found any evidence yet so we'll see who they actually\nPlan for this but I really don't trust the people at all and it just so they'll do anything in power back in ... grams had so\nIt just disgusting to watch to be honest\nI really I Am so I I'm I'm I'm happy to hear you say that with events like this happened I always wonder what the ah reaction is going to be from people who are actively engaged in in these events each and every day and informed about them and the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction is pure commonsense\nIf somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to do it this is not how you do at this these bombs having gone off or pipe bombs\nSome of them are large some of them are small we don't yet know what was in the ... with shrapnel what was it tax was it nails was it a block shot when we don't we don't know any of this none of these bombs would have been capable of taking out a building they were not big enough to be\nBombs and just structural damage if they went off they could have killed some people are given their size so but none of them did go off and they were discovered a mostly and distribution centers\nBy the by the post office and I'll tell you what\nIf this is real Tanya\nUh mostly and distribution centers by the by the post office and I'll tell you what if this is real Tania if this is real\nWhoever did this is going to be named by the end of the week and we're going to know who it is I agree if it if it's really at\nThis point I I'm just trusting people I wouldn't put it past and they pay somebody off I rarely do distressing and the Democrats um so anyway we have a lot of like ten days the let's see what else they put out there next\nWell exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July to polls you really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do not so much in accurately without any doubt predicting winter but the\nPolls today can be highly influential and decisions and action taken\nBy political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling a ... and again for mentioning Bob foreign it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever meet [noise] ah\nI look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly\nExperienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left and I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is that it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them and the left is making every every effort it can\nTo distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office in the forest cabin all out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling\nIs something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try\nBut the degree of frustration they're feeling and having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are it is easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nThe media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they they created a whole cloth something that did not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump that now that they've seen trombone action they hate him to despising they regret voting for him\nIf Americans for all intents and purposes then I began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump that now that they've seen trumping action they hate him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only common sense to be able to have now that now that people have seen trumping action they've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left tastes now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated Trump everybody hated themselves were voting for him\nWell it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue wave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave or Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house is looking iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is one of the Democrats get to run their fraud scheme smokes early voting is where the illegals vote in the dead and vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans were showing up in droves they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people another twenty five thousand people outside block Obama can't even draw one thousand Joe Biden Hillary Clinton can't draw flies there is ab jet panic\nSetting and now you got this caravan coming up and the Democrats have missed

a Republican surge\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle\nWhere it was all this out for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and it was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's\nBeen the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not\nAchieving their objectives so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention there's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh\nThe Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump's just to opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ...\nFolks a\nOf people in our side have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe\nBut if in Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela there's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nJust open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever now do you see all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not when the house but\nI I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary group think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now that argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in math\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for them all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy here's whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying cabin on his family sending rice in

the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not\nIn less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what

difference to me are striking and it it's these kind of racism you you look at how close to the Democrats are making some of these and in others the Republicans are pulling away\nBut it is striking how far gone and how lost the Democratic party has taken the people to support them I mean it's a hodgepodge of people that have given up and become\nVictims and blame everybody else including the

our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of us so that they had not treated our country fairly [noise] so in that sense I Am absolutely and that was rather than\nYou know I this is this is so easy this is so not a controversy this is such a microcosm this is is such a teachable moment this is exactly\nWhy the American left in the media have no idea who Donald Trump is and they can't even relate to it here's a guy who does nothing but love America and that is something they can't relate to loving America to\nThem is old fashioned it's a bygone era right in this era of globalism loving your country is fine but but it's so old fashion and it's it's it's just pass say\nIt so it's so foreign to these people they just there really isn't even a common ground with\nThem on that Donald Trump\nLet me share with the ... my brother David tweeted on this yesterday and it's probably a good way to say and he said Trump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist\nHe doesn't speak in\nTrump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist\nHe doesn't speak in code he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even know what this stuff is when he says I'm a nationalist he's not winking\nAt neo Nazis he's not winking at white supremacists and say we're paid three ups and UPC people he's just a guy who loves America he's a nationalist versus on global if\nHe's going to make America great again he believes America deserves to be great he believes America weeds in the world when it's great\nBut these people are but they're supposedly the intellectuals\nThere the broad minded but there are so small minded and tiny minded that they can't get past\nTheir hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reactions on Trump says is a nationalist they immediately hear a dog whistle yeah Trump's talking to the people in Charlottesville that's what they're thinking that Trump is winking at the people in Charlottesville the Nazis and there you go guys you go that's they honestly think\nAnd if they don't honestly think that they're doing it doubled disservice because they're trying to make people that followed them believe they do think that if they do think that they're the ones I have an electrical problems if they do think if they cannot understand the simplicity\nOf I Love America I Want America to be the best it can be America the best it can be makes the world the best if give if they don't understand that if that doesn't compute with them then they have no business being positions of power in this country because they're not going to accurately represent us or this nation's interests\n'cause this is not complicated it is such a cheap lazy reaction to say\nSee the Trump Hitler nationalist dog whistle\nThere's no basis in fact for it there's still\nEngaged in trying to convince Trump or are they convince people to hate Trump the way they do\nI'm just going to tell people\nYou you're ... if you don't learn to understand this you're going to ever be ... at the guy's ankles\nLoves America\nThinks America is great and can be greater and a great America is great for everybody in it and a great America is made great by great\nCitizens\nAnd that there's nothing wrong with loving America there's nothing wrong with thinking America is exceptional and exceptional America solve the problems of the world and exceptional America creates an economy that is capable\nOf providing prosperity for hundreds of millions of people there isn't another form of government that can even come close\nSocialism can't communism can't by definition at camp socialism communism produced wealth for the leaders by stealing it from the people who created\nAnd that's your Obama's and your Hillary's and pick any Democrat running for president in twenty twenty and a bunch of I'm running for reelection this time around what\nDo you people not understand how absolutely ... seat lazy if he is to say that the guy is simply trying to describe how he loves the country is a freaking Nazi\nYou really think people are going to sign up with that and agree with that when there is not a sin pillar of the evidence you guys are closer to Hitler and not to not see is\nAnd the rebirth that when there is not us in a lot of evidence\nYou guys are closer to Hitler and not to not see as a national socialism is a leftist movement you guys have much more in common with Adolf Hitler in Donald Trump ever go to hope that\nHe didn't start it
