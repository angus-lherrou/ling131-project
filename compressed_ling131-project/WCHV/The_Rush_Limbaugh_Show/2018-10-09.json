clothing Ruth ginsburg\nWho well never mind\nYeah she was a way [noise] um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up at the state of the union speeches having sort of little blind to get through the night why she just seemed falling asleep at of course this is nothing wrong with that uh I'm\nElena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good\nUm Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states just started hearing audio soundbites seven he has apologized shouldn't be Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremony will swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over\nEverybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin all their openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the power capital has as the fifth so called conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is going to be where over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important the Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained to the American people what the American media had not told them\nWhen he resigned at the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by that that he was mocking Dr balls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up\nWith this then that's what we'll do\nHas nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of the history onyx the child's life wailing immaturity is the result of the\nLiberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nEmail and video of these kids on Saturday afternoon to literally calling at the door is that the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop the real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and this this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted not denounced all of it promoted\nAnd encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left as I've been saying what a decent people do in response to this decent people are we're we're not going to become them\nThey have as an objective with a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have an interest to become who they are so given that\nHow are they stopped it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nTo stop things\nThey don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you opposed that how do you beat that back to do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it\nSorry never Trump or his bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia ... the church is rock solid the churches where in during the ... uh not anymore\nThe churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is habit take a look at your papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life\nUnderneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against that from the highest levels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nAccused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels that governs never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it\nAnd from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night this really trigger\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou [laughter]\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and actually Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear about every father loves having his children told him he was a great man few ever are\nAfforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming Kevin O's innocence I mean that is akin to taking all the poison the arrows and every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member\nOf the media tried to ruin capital to openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that wasn't a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to die and find so I don't think any of it was spontaneous and I don't think any of it\nWas happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... forge privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or she was also a storage\n\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the cabin all would pull out and they would never get as far as ... as it got very it was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence no cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise] it won't work nominate we can't sustain this\nWork nominate we can't sustain this you gotta ... nominees inside damn it's night one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee president get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused pullout withdraw ghetto capital that's where they gum up the works\nAnyway I got to take on another brief time out

I'll get right\nTo the point I have one comment one question and comment is it's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that ah the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight\nI actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody is picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety\nIs I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running its Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nAnd the FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order\nAnd you know officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or an eye on them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well\nThat's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this country\nWhere it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democratic Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it which was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America\nIn America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy\nWho any other normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a queen size zero\nBecause he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancel law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that ... been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats coming up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating family [noise] [noise]\n\nWell uh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's really a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairman\nAre retiring cause their term limited\nForty three members are retiring some are committee chairmen and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got a ten chicken TV Time\nYou know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship then you quit and you'll parlay your time they're into big box in the private sector\nYou know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred and nine of them\nBut my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy will ... there were people if this is all true there has\nTo be something or a series of things that the American public is just to be tied over and want to take it all out of the Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people whose country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\n\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there in any even at even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W. Bush was where they drove him down and it was six years anyway uh let me take another obscene profits break we will continue after that [noise]\nDoing more to the mainstream American media just go to Russia but he I beat Mitt word\nPresident Trump and congressman Kevin McCarthy are working together to keep the Republican majority in Congress to gather we must protect the house that is giving you back your money with this story ... ... jobs was drunk or trade deals and your security with border enforcement and\nThe Republican Congress is taking power and money from Washington and giving it back\nTo you but Democrats think your money belongs to the government they want to raise taxes protect criminals with ... cities and reverse the twenty sixteen election within feet but that's\nThe Democratic agenda and the only way to keep the seat Democrats from raising taxes is to do your part\nThis is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November six to help President Trump and congressman Kevin McCarthy put ... house pits majority to for a for a for\nA for more information that's majority to Laurie Laurie boring standard data and message rates apply it was only committee package responsible for the content of this advertising the majority committee and not authorized by any 'cause they were kind of to me to learn more I hold the majority dot com\nIf you suffer from E.
