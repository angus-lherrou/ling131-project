[laughter] well\nWe were we were young adults in the nineties so I'm In my mid forties\nOkay All right fine so your job and your next step up from ... yes and\nMy entire adult working life has been in an economy in decline and not only have\nYou which has been a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years\nBut Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been in the public eye and in particular and and my generation my whole life she you know I remember Hillary\nAs first lady and working on health care and and to see this attack from the last um concerning Donald Trump and his finances and as someone who is the in my country get corps we don't have any money\nBut people who do have a I Am ready to play the where did you get your money from game especially concerning our Senate and Congress\nI find it hypocritical an unbelievable that these people\nWho are completely there just have no self awareness would be you know hounding Trump going after Trump for my part of it I Do not plan on abandoning my president it is the first time in my adult life that I Am in an economy\nThat is growing I was just old enough and walking out into the workforce when NAFTA was really taking hold and the and and companies were leaving leaving leaving leaving not coming back and the like you say and I could not agree with you more\nThe wife has nothing to run on but for my generation to generation who won't have Social Security is gonna bomb out\nWe're broke were ten trillion dollars and that's when I hear a leftist talking about uh all of these things that they want to pay for you know Medicare for all it's a it's a lovely idea but we don't have any\nMoney doesn't exactly right there isn't any\nChristmas you know you're making a really important point that I don't want to gloss over I Want to return\nBack to be a primary\nPoint you've made you are in your mid forties I'm for the first time in your life your living through a growing positive economy that prior to now your entire life has been lived in a either a flat line or a shrinking economy\nYes it's hard and you know let's not forget something for most of that time in the last eight years prior to Trump people like you were also told that this was as good as it going get that you had to work comp and acknowledge that there was a new normal now and that America's\nGreat days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and and this this was more like the way it's going to be now\nSo you were also told not only where you at a flat lining economy your told don't have any lofty expectations here\nRight ... exactly how how let's jump forward to this growing economy in my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick are you actually aware of the growing economy\nAre you actually there is no wrong answer here it's not a trick are you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI Am in a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I'm aware of it the ah\nInformation but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I I Know that is true that it said that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life and\nAnd I literally feel like the finances in America there's been a stranglehold on it as a depletion of it\nI mean I'm old enough to remember sitting around the table and my parents think you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place\nAnd his done in a span and just the you know Twenty years it's boomed am I happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world struggling and and and not have what they mean to survive but on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management I'm not in our government that has ... all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you've talked about the opioid epidemic and and and all of these you know these the fruit the fruit of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is you're you're you're living in the economy or you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because people want to act like oh well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later\nOh shake real skill oh that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject watery lottery winners at all what becomes of um\n[noise] you're absolutely right I just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it but it's real to do that it's not just the result of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters just one thing\nMy mom also told me Christine to eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China but I wasn't smart enough I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I couldn't\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing his mom you're telling me that if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China arguably rubbing their stomachs and boy it feels good to be full\nAnd she called me a smart alec and told me the stops F ing her but she never told me the China starving story again even\n[noise] Russian leaky id [laughter]\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in
