at least even if Democrats are not going to vote for Kavanaugh he added\nFlake wouldn't say whether the protesters played a role in his decision but he acknowledged he was in the middle of a remarkable moment ticked off his interactions with a lot of people on the phone email ... walking around the capital you name it I Wonder if he spoke to the Duke lacrosse players\nIn his speech little

back to my point I always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single accuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations would not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland\n\nNot one and I'll tell you something else [noise]\nOne of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Kavanaugh is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation she would lose even on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence\nIf he sued Mrs Ramirez she would lose if he sued Avon body and his crime they would lose you can accuse
