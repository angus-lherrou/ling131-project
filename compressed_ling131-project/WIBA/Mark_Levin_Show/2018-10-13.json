I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out\nA high place them around need to begin with ... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and what frauds they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation\nThe reality it's brought a bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd see I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witnesses\nThe ones that ended up feeding her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this lesser said there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of ... who could be they didn't remember\nAnother might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIf a sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about this sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media that sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office that is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so\nMore than ever before it's important to know where your moral compass happens to be\nGeorge Bush doesn't like black people but Donald Trump he doesn't like why people think about the only place we'll have ... raids right now\nHuh oh that happened now\nBeing that you are probably more students than the average person out there you know how the game has always been played Democrat politics are what their identity politics they're meant to divide their mental cause friction division they're meant also importantly to do what keep people down\nWhat have we seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their mind remember was talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people who are open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults vote for Democrats now\nWhen it with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time but why is it\nThat for decades to hell we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus it's time for a Democrat no open mindedness no division of thought\nBuying into the identity politics\nBut nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we're still the country where a man from the poorest neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and\nA Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world self made near billionaire\nCan also like Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem because that is where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity\nAnd the one thing if we take a look at George W.

Jay Leno and West Palm beach in mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always in and honoring the pleasure to be filled in for the great one more call then by the way you cannot catch me on Twitter at Brian ... radio\nNow here's an excerpt from the president's base\nThroughout the year we've seen Democrats across the country uniting around and new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we noted takeaway benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\nCalled Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government run single payer health care system better women ate all private employer based health care plans it would cost ... thirty two point six trillion during its first ten years\nOh by the way as a candidate\nI promise that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions and create new healthcare insurance options that will lower premiums\nI've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums coming down I've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare that's why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would of vista right Medicare Democrats\nHad already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than eight hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare likewise Democrats would cut Medicare with their plan government takeover of American health care or end of the extra there for the president let me\nPut something in in very clear terms\nThe president could not be more right\nThe omission and the media I missed one beyond the USA Today piece is pretty incredible\nBut what the president is doing here is an education that you can even get in school right now it's so important the greatest fraud the greatest fraud that has ever been perpetuated and accepted as the legitimate concept but\nWe're all\nTalking about the sliding scale morality and how you have many politicians the whole political party anymore that starts out with an amoral base and it will take you if you line up with them to an amoral place immediately because it's a false premise it's based on\nMedicare for all its financial fraud what the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in their twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points\nReal quickly and here's the first one if\nWe already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know what what's gonna happen if we put everybody on it\nAnd here's the deal according to the federal trusts the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it you got a hundred\nPercent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens\nWhen we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nAnd it is financial fraud is bigger than Bernie made off yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nYou're not paying attention to borders gubernatorial race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's well we've got much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right\nHere in my home state of Florida where we have run this thing I just it was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited in running for the Senate Andrew Gillum is be Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ... no\nYou won't have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum went and he got well that sucks to be you in Florida now it's six to BU everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take boys Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left\nThe backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state she finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support ended up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is they now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a ... year Michael Bloomberg felt like he is the the the populist a sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race of ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particularly\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic we're talking about the governor's race because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run an impeachment President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got fifty per cent on it\nIt is impossible it is a financial fraud is out in out dishonest is that you could put everybody on it and it's got to get better there is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult it financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a ... I'm not making it up it's according to federal defender up as a basic financial literacy test and right now more\nThan sixty percent of adults bail it of basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this doesn't matter how educated one is\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even ... Obama's economy it was only one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a habit of be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was them and we've got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years we got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nYou're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent\nPoint six percent that zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent of those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up\nAgain oh one of the great rods perpetuated that's out there the living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's banking not only are we finally\nJust about a three percent towards a wage growth by the time you add in bonuses goes over that by the time you add in your tax cut churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average net take home pay now a six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time you an income growth that good\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy you're living wage\nAnd I was just a bunch of BS\nSuicides histories one set of facts will continue to do a lot more\nFactual stuff right here I Am ... in for the great one marked a little bit\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer\nExperts recommend using a V.

of the things that you didn't necessarily know specifically we're going to happen with Donald Trump is president but hey you know there would be at the moment so it'd be a little bit different you know uh and yes you have the famed outrage the the moral folks in the media that are\nOh my gosh the profanity Twenty years Twenty years removed from the oval office equally a blue dress\nSow Kanye

that was\nPart of the Nineteen Ninety eight midterm election at all and beach minute effort which is interesting because really the number of different comparisons you could actually make between that midterm cycle in this one but are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there the fraud that is Medicare for all talked about how much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing it's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey\nRepublicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats don't came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats don't\nHere's the

euro us economic system isn't fair\nAs gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nBut here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talk about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the median world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks\nAnd the United states you can even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year\nSince the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago only point six percent the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than the median income around the world\nIt's very difficult to obtain that kind of information right now\nBecause of this insurance first model there is not a much in the line of of consumer price transparency as you noted even looking for it and you're having trouble finding it it is extremely difficult there are a a smattering of health care facilities often not those that are involved in providing major surgery\nThat will provide some price transparency it's part of the importance in breaking the back of this model\nIf we did then you would have everybody that would have to compete on a service and outcome type of model just like we do with everything else is why you know I make the analogy to all of their insurance products in our lives\nIf you end up having a you know a a minor\nIssue what your car you go to a mechanic he get it fixed you can shop around you can see what mechanics or reliable which ones do you feel good about see what things cost and make that decision if you get into a significant an accident\nYou end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop but your insurance company will go and work with right you're not doing as much shopping there so the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nI don't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for the best price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical event right ah so that would be in a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply there might be\nSome other major surgeries to where it wouldn't necessarily apply I mean they were talking major surgeries you have complications that you don't even know about until\nYou get in there are so I you know there are some of these things\n\nTo say oh okay well this is everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics\nIt would provide the level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation\nUh again I I feel for you and and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you they can't provide some level of transparency what I have done and I'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing\nAnd it's not necessarily a something that always comes with an answer\nBut I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to ask you how much is this going to cost\nAnd it can lead to the health care provider\nKind of running in circles and every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually not obtained healthcare and in some instances because they couldn't tell me how much something was going to cost\nI won't necessarily just sign a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here I'm going to pay for I don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it\nSo in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at and hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with the least some guidance on that type of information\nBut again that God Bless and best wishes to you and uh if anybody comes through some specific information make sure that uh your your information there uh we uh we have it and I can get in touch with you I'm All right so\nSwitch gears here for a moment away from health care over to another major fraud by the way\nAs we are getting into this climate talks are going to hold on
