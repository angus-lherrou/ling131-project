states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's certain [noise]\nWhile it to you know a horrific act or worse than a Semitic attack and us history they claimed a weapon lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a congressman Republican and Democrats and talked to a lot of people have to tell you more it's a very very strong\nCommunity and I think a special community and squirrel ill\nOr Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just by did among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought up the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and start a and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence for the entire government of Israel ... because we are the one and all the Jewish state so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and uh that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about but yeah we're the ones that I speak [laughter] that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you are really citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout your um\nUh the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as they call in the United states what do you make of this\n[noise] or we can ... it is as you say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nA in two thousand four ten and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half\nOf hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an\nAttack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it's once again become fashionable or to attack cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris\nAttacks against choosing looms attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six of the federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen and a Jewish community center a at outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you can have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there is a stream missing I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people\nBut online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media is you have this rise of abuse online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel we monitor\nThe Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're you're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of\nThis kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live after a long summer of running your air conditioning the time is quickly approaching the start running your heater as temperatures Trump and most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north and central part of the U.S looks parents a cold or October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replace your age ...\nWe have the perfect company to help you make your life that much easier filtered by dot com America's leading provider of H fact filters for homes and small businesses\nChoose for over six hundred sizes including custom options that ship free within twenty four hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America said five percent\nWhen you subscribe ... auto replacement so you'll never forget to change your filters ever again filtered by will save you time money and help you breathe better that's filtered DUI dot com filter by dot com and tell them mark sent you\nLook we need to spend a lot of time on this election that's coming up too\nAnd we have approximately ten candidates that are coming on this program in the course of this week I Will also be doing an appearance on Hannity\nUh at some point this week and we're going to commit my Sunday show to a ... or the pre election as well it's just way too important we've got some very very close races and what's at stake here is enormous\nAs I say it's Americanism versus socialism it really is for those of us really know what's Americanism versus progressive as ... to ... now the media in this country\nThey don't like to be called the enemy the people there are certainly not the front of the people who've gone long ago\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now at the White House you clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] much\nWho was the ... voice and sing your windows or the eyes of your home\nIt's something in the new law in the next time you look at your homes eyes\nOr thinking about getting new ones because the windows you choose really can change the way you see things considered soft white elements windows\nThe ones I've called the most energy efficient windows anywhere when I say that it makes the other guys a little bit ... and to be fair if it's Seventy inside and out with no win or son\nSome windows are as efficient\nBut when it's twenty and falling and the wind is making the street signs dance like Carla Hayden labels\nElements are better than any window on earth and keeping the cold though and require less effort to do some\nElements windows from genesis\nBecause they are the best windows around and we're just awarded EnergyStar partner for the six freaking straight years [noise]\nAnd they're only available from genesis exterior\n[noise] some people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling the thing is at nova or faculty or rock stars we're talking best selling author who writes scholars and professionals with deep industry experience [noise] they'll teach you how to launch a start up here for patients will a cyber attack I\nDon't think you're settling with an education\nOr the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is force Hillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate unrelated things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at living for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she is accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures\nAre from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than

anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh\nIs a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think a left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted\nAnd are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and a bed as a huge huge issue and then I think ah ah economic growth wage growth energy McCaskill voted against the middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress\nAnd that people want somebody is going to be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill's saying\nYou will oppose or ... or ... methods of protecting people who have pre existing conditions is that your position or she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous fall so she knows it and I've called her out on many times in our debates I support or forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions

one\nWell she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that this she'll never vote against her party but she never does on ... any major issue an issue of consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare\nIn order to pay for Obamacare imagine what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate folks who are\nOr who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nBut you make a good

treating the president's going that out\nI consider you as one of them because you're not doing the people's business you're self promoter your drama queen and you have an agenda\nAnd you're disrupting what could be a very useful news for the purpose of a news conference is not this the purpose of the news conferences so the American people can get some kind of information relating to a head of the executive branch in his activities\nBut this is day in and day out with this Jim Acosta its day in and day out and he wants to win is awards from the media group since I got it but he's not serving any purpose go ahead I\nI'm not going to walk through a list but I think ah those individuals probably knows who they are they're\nDown and shut up but somebody else speak go ahead\nAnd we

people across this country and the only person responsible for carrying out either these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie
