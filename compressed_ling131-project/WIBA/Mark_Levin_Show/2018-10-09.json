and again having put two years of research into this\nBook a next to take that back when he wants to two years wasn't two years about a year of research into this book\nI'm pretty sure it's going to get ugly really fast and I think what it's going to expose that information superhighway I told you about the by passing of traditional channels to get information to the upper levels the FBI where people with political connections would act politically and not in a law enforcement matter that is ultimately the big scandal here [noise]\nNow I told you would get I had a few conservative callers

going to say it's ridiculous that we are Brett Kavanaugh on the bed too many allegations\nWe don't need any doubts behind this guy this is terrible this was in a criminal court trial this was a job interview right Mike is not what you were going to say wink and a nod\nThat's that's how I got on the air [laughter]\nWell let me I'm not obviously not arguing with you I Know you're making that up but let's just say we where it is it a job interview which you well know might\nThis due process applied everywhere this was not a job interview and the traditional sense one job interview I Can't
