all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with Chris you and I'm a poor where she said we can only regain stability if the Democrats win the house and the Senate she's basically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there\nBe a shame if anything happened to it you better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing down\nSo what are you willing to do to stop the mob from taking power\nEight seven seven three one three at one one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days for weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tune in to hear the great one mark living on the market within show he will be discussing\nWhether we are about to embark upon two years of a Democrat controlled house of representatives which will inevitably Maine\nThe investigations impeachment of not just President Trump a probably justice Kavanaugh or if a mark living might be talking about the remarkable his door Rick victory of the Republican Party in maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\n\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington D. C. and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote\nThey made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when we can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media that's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now\nAre you ready because they just showed you over the weekend and over the past two weeks how they're going to govern\nThe Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years\nWhat are you willing to do to stop it eight seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that\nThe Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob and then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast and never Trump ...\nRepublic I was about ... Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican\nYou switch daily call her the Daily Beast\nAnd ... the good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... a friend of mine also would never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Capitol hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left\nThe things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel in happen over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nYou remember the mob is on the campuses have UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire and the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involved marshmallows in small cars\nIn the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob or you're not going to use the law were totally a mop it is without a doubt that there's no other we're now it's a little\nPut a stop what ... what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that delightful she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often deliver you're talking points ahead of time you say are you know I go on a Fox a lot I mind with Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a steward Varney and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as other hosts knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her rejoined her she had her one rejoined her\nWell we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if I had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking to the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob which was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\n[noise] uh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left uh my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these ads mostly peaceful\nIn the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protests this described is mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests of ... and the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that\nPoor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nOn law is not what we saw chasing it right what about\nThe people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a lot I think it's ...\nYeah and if there aren't any party as we call it um out for ... plus they serious\nThat so that's Mary under ... jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual Brooke balls and actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was gonna get pushed back she didn't have another originally under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville side of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nLiving Lennie Lennie Lennie will pass the N. word because I feel like that as part of the weaponization of of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... she knows says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word against Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying\nThe word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's partly right in the sense\nWord as being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today [noise] and it's being weaponized in such a way that it is devastating Lee effective against the Democrats that's\nWhy CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook will start a silencing you if you take your own social media and start calling a mob\nHaven't experienced that in the clinic failed can erupt patients and ... ... tell us about your

mark lives and I want to remind you that ah marks dad has a book coming out October thirtieth at our police by jak within\nIts a colorfully illustrated book for your children are your grandchildren it talks about who are police are all the different kinds of police and uh how important they are two law and order in this country and how important and uh a deserving of admiration an honor they are and it's sad that\nAre frankly that this message needs to be sent to kids today but you see what they're hearing about the cops every day in their uh on the news and in their\nUh their television shows and films and songs and so thank God jak live in has put a pen to paper and made this book you can pre order it now overt Amazon it's outta Tobar thirtieth and it's a great gift especially with the holidays coming up I I Want to get back you know we need the police to rein in the mob\nRight now you know I saw the protests in Washington over the weekend we had the Capitol Hill police down there rolling their eyes at all these screaming Mimi is with Harry armpits and purple hair screaming at the top of their loved one of them climbed up I Can't remember which justice it is but there's a\nAdjusted maybe Oliver Wendell Holmes the statue of a justice out in front of the Supreme Court one of them jumped up there and gave him a lap dance\nYou know because she woke feminist or something and uh and\nThey are a mob and they don't even want us to call them a mob\nListen to the president's again so real fast this was him and his rally on Saturday\nYou don't want to hand magazine is doing artisan ...\nAnd you don't you know our to an angry left wing ma and that what\nThat is exactly what they become and he knows 'cause he's seen ... and this angry left wing mob mob since the middle of his campaign\nUh they really the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe that you are the most dangerous people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they can intimidate you\nThey actually think that they can bully their way into office by letting you know\nThat if they don't when you were going to see more violence in the streets you'll see more protests in the streets you'll see more disruption of our society Eric Holder who apparently wants to run for president he was the attorney general under Brock Obama here he was at a campaign event in Georgia\nMichele always ask my wife like really high which was scared me [laughter]\nIt was filled with says and you know when they go low we'll [noise]\nThey go low we [noise]\nWas his name was ... you go\nThat's ... ... let's say ... it doesn't get any plane or them that\nThey're not shying away from it now see the Democrats the leadership of the Democratic party they had\nTwo choices here they could have been the grown ups in the room stepping forward and saying as much as we disagree with President Trump and the Republicans and justice Kavanaugh\nAnd we opposed his a confirmation process we as a party did not endorse or in any way support the activities that we're seeing right now the disruption that we're seeing right now\nIn our society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't\nThey actually encourage it they this is their base they've decided that there was more power aligning themselves with the mob right now\nThan in condemning the mob that's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets to get in\nThey knew what was going to happen\nThey are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse instead of\nCondemning the mob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nThat you're using coded language the your weaponized saying the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon and that's being used we will weaponize that word we will paint your party as the mob in the streets and so you stepped up and condemn the mob\nOnly then can we actually have a civil conversation in the meantime if you're a mob if you're endorsing the mob if you're supporting the mob\nThen we will warn the rest of this country that if they vote for your party they are empowering the mob so election is twenty seven days away when mark live in gets behind this microphone for weeks from tonight will he be talking about the majority\nParty and what the next two years will look like or we'll be talking about the historic victory of the Republicans holding on to power and make no mistake anything less than the Democrats winning even if they only win by one seat\nAnd I'm not going to plow into ... restaurant disrupting people's meals and scream and the restaurant until the person leaves no one wants to live in that country\nSo it's time to step up\nIt's time to actually put ourselves out there be on record to day what do we committed to do it's got to be more than voting you know who's running you know who's in your state in your district you know what needs\nTo get done so what are you going to do eight seven seven three one three eight one one

he was going to make every single appointment of fight\nTo the death\nAnd and they would demand debate they would do manned the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they've been deferential and they've said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called ... deferential act it's called respect for our American government it's called a ... a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be failed so that it can\nFunction but the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nOr let me read this or much of this editorial for you you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position that requires Senate confirmation ... majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast\nBecause the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys\nMr McConnell has filed cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorneys general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year to assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor of vote for nearly a year\nThink about that\nYou want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\n\nCan't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats are suppose they're supposed to be all about running the government they love the government why are they holding up this president and his nominations just fill basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do President Trump nominated Jeffrey bastard Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate\nEven if no senator as opposed to understand this\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey buster clerk to run the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump is put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to

Iran\nBecause they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin they finally get rid of Grinnell\nAs the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from Iran oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way that it's because they didn't have as an Basset are there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats file clerk sure this is a Senate rule that can be changed and should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us whenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically\nRequires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing for each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just halt progress\nBecause of the thirty hours of course and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want a slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nGoing back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years ... wells\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirmed more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he's now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\nAide Joe Manchin I Know it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from D.

A. B. C. you're on the market within show on Larry O'Connor\nHey Larry how you doing I'm good how are things\nOne we have to take back\nThe government and the way to do that as protest I go on the lights are the marched out of Washington in January it's a piece called march how many skiing and and then he sees all those stations cover that much less than it is a piece called march\nYou gotta look the million people showed up there this past year yup okay but I've been doing it for a long time okay we should march on Washington peacefully surprise the senators and representatives not tell them when it's gonna happen [laughter] I hate it down there and getting the\n... before you do and I will let you get your the thing but it's you know you're so right in pointing out the march for life you know I I live in Washington I'm able to see the march for life and you're right it happens\nUsually or the third or fourth week of January it's usually bitter cold out there\nIt is usually close to a million people you know you saw the a video of the of the screaming Mimi is in the streets or the Saturday after the confirmation vote for justice Kevin alright you saw the video coverage of that nonstop on the news or do you know how many people were actually there ...\nProbably two hundred\n... a little more than that I'd say it was between a thousand and Fifteen hundred but they had the most generous camera angles on them to make it look like the streets were just you just overflowing with outrage and and and it wasn't\nUm the but you're right you're so right how the march of light doesn't in March for life doesn't get the coverage here's my question though we don't march I mean we we conservatives were good for maybe one march a year and it's the march for life may be a second march\nUh here in there but usually eating that's not our style right we don't have the big Soros groups who were handing out walking around money in passing up the pre printed slug sides\nTo march do you think we have it in us do you think that will set our jobs aside in our in our in our families aside so that we can all come to this country say can town Washington DC and march\nOr do you think that we let our voices be heard by actually being good Americans and living our lives\nIf we do not do that\nWe do not get down there and present are cases these people that are voting on stuff will put in there by the people for the people not for themselves that one at a thing is that common that\nPeople have put it the power they start taking away right and that's what people are afraid to say the Democrats and low long if Democrats majority of a communist we'd better wake up in America are\nSince outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow

didn't because\nWe got it we got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBlumberg throws millions of dollars at this NYU program NYU then hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the

the bidding of you the voter you the people in those states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically then sous Exxon Mobil Chesapeake why what whatever oil company in this country\nOr sues the PA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking or oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well funded environmental wackos and this is going on in your state and it's disrupting the progress of our federal government and the EPA the\nPresident Trump is in charge of fanned why because they can't win at the ballot box they can't win in the elections and so they just throw a bunch of money at lawyers and they tried to sue everybody to try to get their way and try to push their agenda\n[noise]\nI'm Larry O'Connor that this is the mark living show\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead

wants mob start breaking out attacking people in their cars\nGetting into their faces and did it personal space where they feel threatened\nBucks or off financially to be split open\nAnd I'm not kidding you saw what happened in Portland right\nWell I don't I Know about what happened with the cars were attacked them elderly people I'll tell you what people think I'm not kidding what sort of bacteria cause pepper spray or whatever\nBut when you are in a state where you were there was stand your ground if somebody gets right into your face you feel threatened knocked it people's I'm telling man was not come from the Bronx\nYou get into my space and into my face and I feel friend you're going down and you know what the what do you do with a bully punch them in the mouth and these people were like sitting ducks it's like we're like little flowers around the country and we let these things happen it's got to stop\nAll right Paul is bringing some Bronx justice to the streets right now and listen this is when I\nSee these mobs when I see the the crap going on there that's exactly what I think too that is what my instinct is as well\nThis is what is it I don't want them to be violence I don't want there to be a a a riot in the street but I can tell you this or the echo what Paul said uh I'm not going\nTo throw the first punch but if I get pushed over if I get confronted if I get punched\nOr most of the time my rule of thumb was studies is if it doesn't make common sense\nI tend to not believe it [laughter] if it cuts against the grain of what if I see a study and I said well they can't be true\nThat makes no sense my entire life history and every single person I Know in my life and everyone that I've ever talked to a informed me that that is a a load of of of steaming dog do\nAre generally speaking then uh I I go with my instincts and I and I just regard the study miss one though I find to be fascinating and I think that makes sense but what I'd like you to tell me is why why do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nOver male politicians midterm elections are just around the corner\nAnd so it could be a potential turned the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says the skewed article from study finds a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males and survey fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researches and the Stevens of to the second allergy that won't bug it down in a lot of the uh various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find this to be a sort of the most important part\nOf when it breaks it down between a Republicans and Democrats or this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor\nA female politician mailed Democrats will favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way\nRepublican men and women are fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other now me if I'm looking at\nTwo Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and in terms of their their a resume their track record it's is it I'd have to flip a coin between two Republican candidates and one's a man and one woman\nI'd probably go for the check I probably put the baby up there I don't know why I got I think\nIt makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most ... nations fighters\nFor the conservative cause have been women I'm just more impressed by them and I think\nThey're used to take him to death a little bit more and they give it back a little bit better I think men are are are are are too easily touted by the media they\nOh they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a oh don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics\nThey hurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising grad and you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given\nBirth\nI don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all that died I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans that conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia that don't judge people by the chromosome will make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how woke I Am\nI'm I'm I'm more feminist an hour and all that just wait I'll I'll you betcha I think that this is a way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one point but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes uh they they want to show women\nHow incredibly wonderful they are looking Harvey Weinstein I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified the very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right cause he raised money for all the right candidates he was pro\nRight and I don't know what happened I had the actor accept that my hair and my
