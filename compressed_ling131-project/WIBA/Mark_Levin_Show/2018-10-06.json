but we all do so that's the the first the most important thing be second is that there are two sides to stories in one side effects\nNow you're the facts and it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy\nLast Thursday in bless her heart Susan Collins\nWho delivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying\nAt any point today one that oh my God Chuck Grassley doesn't Jews left who goes by those funky\nAnd Susan Collins Susan Collins this afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver who the heck happened a year at a at a lot of interesting interesting things going on\nBut in the context that there are two sides to stories the one side effects Thursday you have somebody be on\nBeing the aforementioned Susan Collins who was unbelievable today\nWho said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and ah you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people yeah you know they both were no they weren't not no they were not going to be right somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available Christine four seats filled out people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're advancing to the final vote tomorrow on Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nBut she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world but the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation offer\nBut as long as I have an opportunity to do so which she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said it's wrong that's wrong and it's important now when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine Ford\nThey are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator a woman who committed an act of evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nAbsolutely already held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do the right cab and I am one hundred percent certain\nHe was Brett Kavanaugh machine not trying to effectively ruined that man's life\nHis family's life how evil do you have to be to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did and it's important\nOnce again and we don't just white off because break out it's going to make it through this thing and ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we end up a boarding the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs Tucson I'm not trying to rub it in my dorm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know\nNot and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise then we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator watch and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are\nNow a couple of things as we are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way it really has been that kind of a wake has meant that kind of a couple of weeks kinda three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and\nAnd understand what Kavanaugh's been through an emotionally doesn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here the sole capping off thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... or ...\nI don't want to show my home station W.

flea market Montgomery unites mini mall living rooms bedrooms dine that's oh yeah and you can find that the market and the saddest thing about flea market Montgomery\nIs that it it went down during the recession that was that was maybe one of the saddest moments during the entire great recession anyway are now in this great economy we can have new flea market Montgomery isn't do the or there'll be bigger there'll be beautiful or they will have doors in the in the walls I just\nOh by the way I Am Brian mud and for the great one more to live in and uh get to some of your calls here and just a moment by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh\nThe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just take their straight to the FBI place\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have received\nAnd [noise] the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone if they tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade people who are close minded\nIf somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people and this is true conservatives to by the way it's not like this is unique to liberal is there a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm gallon that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything\nPublic sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it in other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable I'm Brett Kavanaugh so\nWhat does that tell you\nJust go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you needed all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive\nThe first thing I find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lacking it because once you\nGive up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just gonna view you as someone who is highly political train that can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable uh is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's ... eldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame than ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah\nYou know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach

going on about five ... eastern time tomorrow as the final vote should take place approximately\nAround that period of time but at this point given the Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nAgainst foreign Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's\nA ... seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so ah the it it absolutely appears\nThere are the boats and in fact something interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically Kavanaugh would have been dead though to bring it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical so it was her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office uh with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put down including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would\nBe kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Alaskans seems like at least some might now actually be reconsidering\nHas taken a look at the most likely outcome here or it looks like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positive that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nI have known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabinet particular\nUh that that man when he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\n... to ... I think Brecht cabinet as role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged and paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the concerns of course has been well you know Trump's kind of Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce their kids to somebody\nThat seems to have all the ripe for priorities and the right places is the right way doesn't backed down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this and it actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered if the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nAnd for the mid term elections I'll give you the Reader's Digest version we tend to be incredibly incredibly predictable in terms of political swings in this country the issues change the politician strange times change\nBut we had been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk you back real quick to the president's election twenty six same\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable and twenty six team when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and the way I was able to do it just based upon historical trends\nSimply put you take a look at history back in a twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president\nThere has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats to see today full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office yes he later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent in all during the primary process\nEspecially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running you know is that Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can be good this and that ... vote for the person you believe in because the odds are the Republican candidate what when and sure enough\nYou go now in the context of mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent president's party loses generally in fact there was only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is\nThat the incumbent presidents party has actually gained seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point in\nAmerican history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had\nThe bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nFlex employ American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush and the wake of nine eleven so we took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in the mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate map favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and\nWhat we've seen ever since she indicated that she was like would it be a no vote about ten points about ten point to what the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on backup this\nAgain when I've been taking a look information only and how much this boat meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points yay or nay because those are pro Trump broke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to say but still the house you can take a lot of getting ... check any of the polls he checked decides to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are facing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nMy question is and this is what I'm working on because again I base everything off of information aren't we add an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that it now I guess to what we went through in any of those other examples\nNot the great depression not after nine eleven\nIf you're looking for a comp the absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on\nIn fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton\nBut then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right we've had the more investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house and could be analogous Heathrow cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs this that moment and done then inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but there is an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue

yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where he spent up now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I'm not going to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take I'd given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today

the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back through his comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch

stupidity or here in South for ... for Marco then and I'm I'm In West Palm beach now this happened in Boca which is the uh\nCity that is further south in Palm Beach county yesterday and the Palm Beach post was covering this and as soon as they did well this crowd as they put it of retirees in Boca which by the way if it was ... fifty people fifty that's being generous but anyway speaking to a crowd of retirees and Boca Raton\nJohn Paul Stevens Thursday said that high court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh who Stevens once lauded and one of his books does not belong on the Supreme Court Stevens a lifelong Republican who is known for falling on the liberal side of judicial really\nThank yes bank [laughter]\nKevin on one of his rulings and one of his books blah blah blah anyway here's the deal I Do credit the Palm Beach post by the way for at least be somewhat honest by saying that he\nIs known to follow the liberal side of things let me give me an idea the media it sucks in this country All right and uh I don't have to tell you that\nBut it it is really easy to information early and empirically tell you who in what John Paul Stevens is because anytime you could find a Republican in this case a lifelong Republican\nAnd get an idea about John Paul Stevens former Supreme Court justice key is to the Republican Party\nWhat Steven briar is over to the Republican Party you go see the briar liberal from San Francisco on the ... yes thing go\nStephen Breyer now why\nBecause they are heading Danny little check of the Washington University school of law Supreme Court database\nWent back and compared the voting records of one John Paul Stevens to other Supreme Court justices he served with guest who he broke with most commonly you guys did even\nBut what you don't hear about\nFolks that sacrifice everything and there was something that happened here yesterday that criminalizes this perfectly for the entire country now the sun sentinel to give me an idea of just in the grand scheme of awful where they stand\nOne of their ah major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay\nThe people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz so it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron disadvantage for governor for years after endorsing Democrat\nRight\nLikes or from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron does Santa's for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways and\nA lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently as a Democrat that is a serving out of the saint Pete area but uh anyway well it's about time he actually was a Republican governor and in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell Floridians that Iran does say that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this than is he asserted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years said the quote\nFrom the president of the border police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to\nThis pose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for this unsettled he ended the article what this team gave you all for examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother's had their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I notice what was going on not long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look and and I was tracking violence towards police officers remember before the whole Kaepernick\nThing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police has resulted in place being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework\nMight not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance but here's what's real\n\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had ... and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and for about the ... police benevolent association with more officers dine line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups\nBy media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started this theory that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop get ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of all\nPeople to put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nIs not getting better it's getting worse where this kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't want to have\nMS R.

I mean it's been in ... in impressive showing by some of the may be least likely suspects in the Republican writes\nAll right now I get to some of your thoughts here earlier this hour talking about police the importance of supporting them now more than ever given everything that they face in terms of danger in our society along with\nA media and politicians that are complicit in basically playing politics against their interest often um we have Brian from Greensboro Brian a retired cop go\nHey how's it going to say about all good men\nDo good uh yeah so I started law enforcement but two thousand ten and just recently got out a back in June I decided to open my own business in the ... one of my main reasons for it was because of the uh the hostility towards police across the nation in general [noise] ah\nThey don't give me an idea of some of what you came across in the field\nHow I dealt with antifa um whenever they came after the federal the statues down in a in ... North Carolina are dealt with a W W from dorm or at the same rally\nUm you know I've dealt with um people look at you flip you offer just say to you because you're a police officer\nUm [laughter] I've been I've been working in the other officers have been killed a lot of duty\nIn what is the response in the media what do you get the in terms of what you see with politicians what you hear in the media compared to what you live\n[noise] part of it you know you see the hostility in on the media they are all labor traded which does portray the the\nBad jobs the crops that are always doing something bad but you know I worked with a lot of good police officers just like you were talking about that did the best that they could\nWith the circumstances that you know they were in now in this day in time\nAnd they still treated people with respect and dignity just like\nThey should be treated even when they weren't being treated that way themselves [noise]\nAppreciate and Brian I a British or your service sorry that ah you you end up leaving because of the circumstances best wishes to you and your business gives you a bit of an idea he actually reminded me I end up here in from a one of my buddies couple of weeks ago have a lot of police officers that are\nLike keep up with and one of them a share a story or just recently there was a a is a family and I'm just sitting on two kids husband wife\nAnd the African American white police officer they ran a red light and he said he was going to give him a warning they clearly ran it but\nDidn't end up being dangerous he was simply going to pull them over and warn him so he he pulls 'em over he approaches the car\nAnd not only is the driver the father cussing at him kids which he estimated to be maybe around ten eleven years old we're flipping them off in ... and that um to\nNow these are the stories aren't told not politically correct stuff like this happens every day all the time you have folks to put their lives on the line\nAll the time national news everywhere big deal what happened with the backup and Illinois convicted today but you don't hear the for cops\nBeen killed in line of duty over the past week and their families the widows kids without fathers that's what's real\nAnd if not for us and then who's going to be so again every cop is a good one but hundreds of thousands almost all of them are and God Bless them because of now for them where or any of us are any of us\nAnd uh let's see ah I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer want to hear from you in\nJoe ... are you tonight hey doing well\nFantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and\nIt's especially with coming from my department you you just see a face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so I'm everything that the media puts out toward this they're definitely feeling it", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "06"}
