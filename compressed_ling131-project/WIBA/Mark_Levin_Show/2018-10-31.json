it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the ... on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide the ... first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old I started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is\nAnd so when the president is asked about it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive no you can't change that constitution by executive order oldest the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't\nWhich all explaining a minute but here's the current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't [noise]\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject

bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\nThis is my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of national\nReview these wants to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue codified in the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to interpretation but\nWe know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment because they told us\nWe have no real Supreme Court decision a convincing a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens and then we have Paul Ryan\nLet's play cuts six again Mr boost and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch kicking back in Saudi do interpret and\nEnforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\nYou're stuck who's changing immigration\nLaws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent he writes over a conservative review a and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\n[noise] oh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the last year patriot dead he's a he's in a better place thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you can do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is\nThat even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want to ... a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing ... as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the\nTime and they tell us exactly\nWhat they meant and nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one Kim all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research\nIs that for most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people are born here who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens and we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals\nAnd instead that is being bath or dies to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise\nAll American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a\n... minute let me just say that I have to go some Len let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans\nThat amendment that amendment was for former slaves that's it\nDone and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil or the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves had nothing to do with illegal alien same sex marriage this one not one of the nothing whatsoever so the left pores that agenda end of the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel Horowitz keep up the good work we much appreciate and my
