they don't ask a question to get an answer\nThey ask a question to develop an advance a pre existing storyline\nOn any question it doesn't matter folks throw it out there on taxes the preexisting storyline is um tax hikes are going to bankrupt the government and that they're always in it for the rich the Republicans that's the that's they're not asking you a question about tax cuts\nThey're just asking a question to advance the narrative that you're on the side of the rich guys screwing over the average American on health care it's there you're looking at throw grandma off the cliff you're cruel you want people to die\nOn schools is that you're starving public schools uh money despite the fact that ... uh public schools have records of matter of fact it doesn't matter they're not really asking questions what they're trying to do is get a narrative advance and they're trying to do what's called framing or trying to frame the question in a very specific way\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic you know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes\nOf course they're gonna do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they hadn't been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely\nIt is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance she re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight is Trump's narrative\nIt's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans\nThis is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical Trump knows that Trump is comfortable\nWith that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames\nLeslie stall smart\nShe's listen she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal says liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically senses Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted and four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes to battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\n\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists take away number one is you re framed the question and reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know folks\nThey sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he has caused\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nThe benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie and and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of again a\nBattle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits it hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity so we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democrat Party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they're they\nBased their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\nI mean who what other presidents\nOther than Donald Trump will never forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren is going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them to win Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go I didn't go let aces embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo

to sit here and listen to a woman who put down on her form to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American Native American heritage wrote an entry in a cookbook about powwow chow\n\nThat's real by the way it is\nAnd and as possibly one one thousand and twenty fourth America\nThis is I'm not give it a Democratic Party a vise I'll just say you constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us

Sanders for rich they're the worst part he says if I got is like third house now\nBernie Sanders he makes a fortune for richer than what you are the rich he is the one percent\nDonald Trump's like

like\nTrump's orders if they get a little bit of walking that's a good guy\nJohn I disagree though I Know I'll tell you why\nThe less I run myself albeit unsuccessfully almost doesn't count politics is you know but you know listen I gave it the old college try a lot of experience um in liberal states Marilyn specifically where I did run and one of the things I've always not why risk it about the Democrats\nIs their ability to almost ruthlessly stay on message\nWill be whether it was Obamacare the Obama tax hikes\nBomb a regulatory assaulted red tape on our businesses are on message no matter what Obamacare was about to get more coverage tax that's got to make people pay their fair share about regulations to protect the environment and feeling like\nThey are almost ruthlessly good at staying on\nMessage Donald Trump has been so fragile fragile that just and it's about trying to be a target this why no you're wrong\nThat just mid term election a major party representative for their

work and then you want to give us a call he's seven seven three one two three four months he says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIt's News I'm Carmen Roberts several media outlets say Saudi Arabia or maybe you're ready to admit journalists Jamal show he was killed by a mock jury not boxed in irrigation President Trump can comment denies any of the ...\nAnd Saudi investigators joins section or Trump's economic tore measures the royal family responsible\nThe Reagan tax cuts after taxes were cut tax\nRevenue went up dramatically\nIt almost doubled by the time Reagan left office that's a fact you can look that up yourself\nGive Google those has tax\nWebsites that go over historical packs numbers to keep it adjusted for inflation they went up dramatically\nBut it's evidence of the liberal tactical ability to constantly stay on message that's typically falls state that false message repeatedly use the media to isolate people from the truth because the media will parrot the narrative and I tell people that your story and get people to believe something that's factually incorrect\n\nTo say that the say the Reagan tax cuts caused the deficits tax revenue went up we just spent more money that is not a factual but we've been told that so often people believe it\nYou know the the whole thing about how Clinton Clinton wiped out the national daddy's zeroed out the national bad you know deficit under Clinton that is just not true\nSome people say oh there's a there was a Clinton surplus I I used to bring this up on the show all the time when I first started filling in for ... years ago because if it not because it's um\nIt's a it's a talking point that it it's just it's so ingrained\nInto the American psyche do liberals effective messaging that people believed it was actually a Clinton surplus there wasn't there was no year and Clinton's presidency were the government took in more money\nThan it's been noted they got close at the end of his presidency but there was no surplus ever they ran annual\nDeficit and put it this way the simplest way to describe because liberals always have a tough time understanding even mechanical basic says if there was a surplus in the Clinton years answer real me this right\nHow is it that every single year of the bill Clinton presidency every single year the national debt rose please explain to me in normal mathematical terms how bad happened if they ran a surplus\nIt's not always didn't pay the debt back home the debt what up every single year the Clinton presidency but no I was told on TV that was that Clinton surplus ... you were told wrong I I don't know what to tell you you know you were probably\nTold when you were a kid various fairy tales to which adds a family friendly show so I'll leave it out you know what I'm Talking about\nYou believe in those now too as well\nYou were isolated from the truth\nOr they need is one that ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clintons surpluses Mitt they would go away forever but they won't\nDo it\nThey do this now they're doing it now and the reason I'm bringing it up is because they are good at staying on message that's how they get these myths to persist over\nTime Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who Spartacus you got one guy on ice skate board in the parking lot better now you got one guy talking about\nFart jokes at a at a serious Sheldon Whitehouse this is the Democrats\n\nI fundamentally disagree with just about all of their policy positions but I'm telling you I have always respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is\nNot in the era of Donald Trump they cannot do it they\nAre so overtaken with rage at everything this guy represents the anti swamp rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruth in straight up live they cannot they simply can't contain the rage\n\nHe's got them talking about booth failing in Senate hearings he's got a Cory Booker declaring he's a sporadic his from the or at least just silverstone clueless movie\nHe's got Elizabeth Warren releasing a press release I bought one one thousand Native American jobs by the way a Fox on in the background the Cherokee Nation just responded and and in a\nBrutal brutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who what was she thinking the answer is they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media and turns it back on them\nHe and he gets the last word and just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans this is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and they're swamped rat Democrats back on their heels because they don't know how to respond anymore\nThe standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears you know I've said with his fair share stuff\nThat I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is Don apologizing for taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happened to be successful and wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no
