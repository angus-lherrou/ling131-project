Fox News the presidents and yes things Saudi Arabia will be dealt with if it's down to sponsor of all the disappearance of journalist ... resident\nAnd and it it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does know what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than\nPutting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a a alarm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up\nTo protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing is protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\nNow all of this I say to go back to court point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from work before a mini that know me I I play tennis and college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country to student with a student\nVisa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come into caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do at the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break in your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nYou know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation\nIn Saudi Arabia again he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words member don't trust them into action not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and is an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outrage over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person should calm down it should be loving which one is it to the media which one is\nDo you want a president that defends his country and fights this country's interests for why he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's on hands these crazy and he's made an evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalist are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work and something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freak out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrage is have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they allowed women to drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you\nStill in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they were cut off legs they will cut off ... feet as part of punishment they will give lashing to old people\nAnd young people in the hundreds and hundreds of ... they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or to criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had\nRelations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and it's taken on his own because it was a member of the media and it's terrific what happened to him\nBut his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must were I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know\nWhy we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees that Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is you know we've been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald Trump's a villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia because wait a minute because whenever I was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective of I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your life\nMost journalists are self important\nCan't use the word I Want to use a\nI Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they're better for example than even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated this happened I hate to this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant caravan are illegal immigrants heading towards America is what a president should do regardless of party you don't welcome operate because you don't you know I mean what what what is the media want Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left wants to do but I'm saying this directly to media\nDo they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a ... a great fence\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America and break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump pug\nOne eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven\nI'll get your reaction you can

Republicans all over the country\nI I also love how you know you know how everybody on on in the media TV et cetera talks about how they can't stand Donald Trump's demeanor the way tweets how many is Nancy Pelosi two days ago said she wasn't willing to trade over the border wall and called it quote Trump's manhood issue referring to his manhood\nIs she willing to put\nHer shit but no but did you ... ... again let me quote her it happens to be it happens to me like I'm manhood issue for the president building the wall and I'm not interested in that\nWhere is that ... again where's the media

should apologize to the president not a single article about it\nPassing their bill to get to get protections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give illegal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\n\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately needs them to be able to vote\nThat is what this is actually about the Democrats are terrified that they're not going to win back the house and Senate and they were gonna do it before they did they say character assassination and Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\nWe had a big when we think are Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting\nAnd they woke up a bunch of you and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost the Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction it's not over yet but I think we're at least had in the right direction and Democrats are terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house in the Senate and they need new voters in this country 'cause they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want I mean Hillary Clinton wants to Donald Trump\nYou don't think they're freaking out right now and they need new voters and the way to do is get illegals in here and give them in as to amnesty and then they know they can win every national election\nLook at what bet to the fake Hispanic guy who wasn't even allowed to join the Hispanic caucus mean this is the guy that in\nThe running against Ted Cruz in Texas who's

give incentives for companies to work in America and not keep their money offshore and build factories in Americans have building them overseas and I'm going to fight back on tariffs which he has done\nI'm going to get back to the American people more of their own money which he has done with the ... with the Trump tax cuts\nI'm going to have a country that has aggressively growing\nThen it's better for everybody where where the water rises in ... ships\nInsert\nHardcore leftist Democrat who has I Would argue virtually no soul and the reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts where she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars a six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party the Democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is a lie\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because the jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just sit in that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is it why\nI'm not going to focus on that for for that that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you Harris's office as she rolled out this plan today sided aid to thousands Seventeen survey\nFrom the website bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as that rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rate survey came out and it said their headline of his own survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings aid rely on in an emergency\n\nSo what you have is you have\nCome out of Harris is saying OK Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me\nBecause people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps or we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I gotta do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give me that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with a rent increase of medical bill or child care so she wants to give you government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expects\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I say this summer correctly 'cause I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out and said I said it wrong so I'll correct\nIt right now calm down you're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money\nIs going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because at the same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nWhen we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they would they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right\nPeople didn't save that money they got extra money they went out and spin it right away go work at the stats\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of it every single month\nOn average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year but there are now
