after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser instead George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then there wasn't a black Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards\nIt was his what happens when negroes don't read [noise]\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from bakari sellers\nNow in ... west set this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people [noise]\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when they grow don't read snow you didn't hear it you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in those schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public edge ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue that the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery and\nSo what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro who went from living on the plantation miss for days or wants to play the audio get this this Kanye West while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation\nThan the ... comes out in ... started singing for himself and search realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm saying massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm seeing a kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party he starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there I don't know you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id how racist that mentality and then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I'm going to be independent\nThinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate and all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then\nThey reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrats says it not racist 'cause the black person said is it not racist because it's supported by all Democrats\n\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's tweets are are are are ... horrible\nThis same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets about this thing national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you\nTo tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nThere it is don't tell me that the Democratic party cares about black people\n\nDon't tell me that this isn't racism don't tell me that this is not slavery modern day slavery\nYou shut up you sit down in the back of our black bus and our black party in our Democratic Party and you say what we tell you to say\nAnd what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're brilliant but if you ever get out of that lane if you ever get off our plantation and try to make a name for yourself or have independent thoughts we will go out on national TV and we will bully you and we will tell people that you're mentally unfit\nYou're mentally insane you are mentally incompetent you've been to a hospital before for mental health issues clearly the white man's taking advantage of you all and by the way you're an ignorant black person\nTo tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThere it is that is your Democratic Party\nThat's exactly what they say if you leave their democratic plantation now\nI'll be happy to hear you tell me how I'm wrong now I Would love for you to tell me why it's appropriate because a black man disagrees with the Democratic black party and walks off their democratic plantation and actually starts to say things that make sense about the reality of the economy\n\nHow this isn't shaming bowling racism how this is I mean the same party that says I again it's coming out day\nCome out love everybody saying well love everybody let's support all the gay lesbian transgender demise sexual but uh we also got a rip on a black man today who went and became a Republican\nTell you what is what happens when they grow don't read and then we'll say

of them\nTo get to get a mental checkup because you look you look at Maxine Waters you look at Al Sharpton you look at several others even some of these school teachers that are against Kavanaugh and whatnot and all the tweeting and say look off the president wants off the vice president wants off this person\nHas any one of them thought that maybe they're the ones with the mental handicap\n... just look at the last couple of weeks of the Democratic party and what they've been saying I mean ...\nIs what happens when negroes don't read Tanya is a token eager the Trump Administration black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the racial draft Conyers attention or like the president then you have ... and it gets better than that Maxine Waters says she threatens Trump supporters all the time Eric Holder said it's OK to kick Republicans\nHillary says not to show civility to Republicans I mean ... at what point is this incitement to violence and then they say you can't say that there's mob rule here you because it's unfair to Democrats who say that they're acting like mobs while they're screaming and surrounding people like Ted Cruz at dinner with his wife\nWhen they're banging on the doors the Supreme Court after they don't get their way while they say they want and pizza president nine states America if you vote for them and their right to impeach Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court if you give them ... control of either the house or the Senate\nThat's what they're saying and don't forget\nNow Taylor Swift the beautiful white woman is a role model and a brave woman because she came out and supported Democrats Kanye West comes out for Trump and he's a token negroes mentally ill Uncle Tom\nWho clearly is being used by the president United States of America\nNot only that you look at and cheaper in Oregon and everything they've done to all the ... the peaceful Republican rallies there too\nThey they were directing traffic this last week is screaming at why people they didn't take their owners you saw that on TV\nIt's nuts and and my question to the American people is at what point are we going to say enough is enough let's stop this let's be done and let's wipe this freaking slate clean\nWell I I'm waiting for the the the Democrats to say the socialist Alexander Cortez\nUm\nWho claimed the electoral college as an institution that has its roots in slavery\nAnd by the way the Democratic party has its roots in slavery so\nI'm just curious are we going to eliminate the Democratic party as well because the Democratic party has its roots in slavery but this is a woman that literally claims electro college is an institution that we should abolished because it has its roots in slavery just like the party that she's a part of and this is also a woman who came out and said\nRight right have had that they had that for years that they ran on you know you want to get to that you want to stop spending all this tax money Iraq Afghanistan you want to give kids a good education and you want to stop spending money on defense and stopped seeing these poor boys over to be killed in these women to be killed and since most wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're right\nThat the playbook is make it personal undermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh's rail\nHere's my question to you here's my question they use for interrupting regret what we do conservatives and especially if African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide track I hate to say\nWell it was Democrats Democrats I Do believe would have taken control of the Senate if it wasn't for them over playing their hand with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're furious and they realize it another four years of a Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party as we know because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have what when in point in numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified of but what what I Will say is is that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive\nAnd I think the Brett Kavanaugh as what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans who say that character assassination that character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call them and when there's only there's only one thing you could do that would have been worse\nSaid he's a child rapist that's it right it's child rapist and rapist\nAnd they went all in against Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't about\nIt it wasn't about honesty it wasn't about fairness it wasn't about a true investigation it wasn't me it was about trying to destroy a man keep them off the Supreme Court to inspire democratic voters and I think they ever played it I think will hold the Senate and house I really do if we go out and vote\nAnd I appreciate the phone call thank you sir it's nice to talk to you by the way I just got back from a small

Madeline you are on the marquee event show Ben burgers and filling in the Knight hello\nAnd thank you so much and I had an excellent job thrown in for mark\nThank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I had two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but\nWhen I started winning and mental health housing and they spoke out about somebody of use it that we're going on and from the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all the sudden I seem to have like ... says although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought ahead anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of the two places even up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of a history of anything on a new homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention months\nAnd I think by making it sound as though Congress has some kind of mental illness whether he ... is not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him before of them spoke out about Bush\n[noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't he wasn't he got out her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just in just that people know that we were when we make it clear what did it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen World Health or a world mental health day\nUh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I say this first of all thank you for\nYour sharing your story and I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have great compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token a black\nMan a ... and there and he's taking advantage abusing him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was the narrative they wanted to be out there it was the
