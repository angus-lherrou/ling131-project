Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement a response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very

I'm of that and I ... and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men of faiths were they not\nYes and and that's been documented in and\nA lot of people want to do that because it has any interest of the secularists to uh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation or back to secularism and
