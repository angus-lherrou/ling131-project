get government out of every aspect\nThey've been letting our economy's store you know basically one of the great things we've seen under this Trump economy\nIn the last year in nine ten months now are looking forward to that a brand new life liberty and live in this Sunday on Fox News ten pm eastern I'd make sure you tune in for that you can get your mark live infects I Know I Will I'll want there's so much to to touch on right now you realize\nThat the election is now is it Eighteen days away Nineteen days away I Know I did drugs has been doing the count down over there and I'm In this is it's a big one anybody who's saying this is the most important election of our lifetimes\nOr is it just blowing it up your you know you know what's a ... they say that every time\nAnd it it starts to sound ridiculous and people on television in Manhattan and inside the beltway here in DC they start to sound history on\nA ... and it's all a reason to sort of try to inspire their base I supposed to step forward it's not the most important election of your lifetime uh but but it's important for the next two years\nBecause of the Democrats do when the majority in the house we're looking at obstruction even more so than what you've seen we're looking at the resistance movement holding the gamble\nIn the speaker's chair and in ... the chairman share of every single committee you're looking at impeachment you're looking at investigations\n... as far as the eye can see your looking investigations of the Trump Administration and the Republican Party and conservatives in this country in general I and if you don't believe me if you think I'm speaking in hyperbole listen for a moment to one of the shining lights of the Democratic party probably this guy's going to be running for president\nOr he is on the intelligence committee he's Joaquin Castro he's a congressman he's a Democrat he's on the intel committee\nWhich means the Democrats taken very seriously I this this used to be a committee that that you know transcended party it was about the most important sensitive information that this country or could ever waded into\nA ... that that it it shows no politics there's no red there's no blue there's just red white and blue on the intelligence committee and then the Democrats brought us Adam Schiff as the ranking member\nAnd uh this guy Joaquin Castro of Texas who who claims to be and they say of him that he is presidential material he was on Hillary Clinton short list for vice president this guy I she came on CNN earlier this morning\nAnd made a full of himself and committed what is tantamount to if not defamation of character at the very least one of the most irresponsible things I've ever heard of\nPolitics about another government official and that's saying something speaking about the current situation in Saudi Arabia\nI Know poppy that there's been a lot of discussion about this I Will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most of the survey right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with [noise]\nTo the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the print that may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action again [noise]\nCircus OJ kit kit as they are not that we have I just find me fair for me or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're getting there had been recording to that effect ... according to that effect sure\nNow here's where you have to understand why this matters more than just you know some sort of gap for some sort of outrage the outrage of the day a Democrat is accusing Jerry cushion or of ordering the hit on this guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince\nA ... that's certainly all valid and true but here's the most important thing you need to understand about\nThis he's one of their stars the Democrats win the house two and a half weeks from today and he is in the leadership I mean he's he's he's\nA rising star he they're going to give him power more power than he has right now this guy who was peddling a conspiracy theory that is completely be bombed unfounded and\nAtrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television and accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist the shockey could be killed\nAnd and they're going to give him power\nNow at this may not be the most important election of your lifetime but if you care about the direction of our country for the next two years if you care about anything positive getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and fed up\nOf the ongoing drama that you see play out and cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats are acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly he has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that kind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo a accused Jared Kushner of any illegal behavior and I didn't intend to accuse jury questionnaire could you\nMay have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with [noise] to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the print that may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action again circus oj\nI bet he did you hear what he just said and now he claims after the fact via Twitter is how they do it these days that I didn't I didn't intend to accused Jared Kushner\n\nOf calling a hit or doing anything untoward are delivering this information well here's the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who won't go on television he's fine going on international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with [noise] to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nHe goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming bloody I mean and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the daily\nBeast a website which is which is a left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that Joaquin Castro did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there's no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay\nCongressman Castro uh I understand your statement saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what it did intend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what you said\n\nAnd and and here's the best part of his denial\nThat never got any follow up and never got any challenging as just accept that oh well he's ... he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him in his words they didn't do it he said all I said was there was reporting\nTo the effect that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I you see and now and now that's that's the crux of it because they didn't see everything that happens in this town\nYou don't want to match what ... you have the power to garnish your paycheck about your bank account and even take your home or business that's all true but thankfully they're offering a way out a fresh start initiative\nIf you qualify you could save you a

would want them to live\nAchieve something at the highest level suddenly be a dedicated his entire professional life too and then they saw Democrats defending him they saw Democrats are skirting due process trying to destroy this man for their own selfish political purposes and then wrapping their attacks\nIn this this protective blanket of of women's rights of of trying to protect the victims of sexual assault or ...\nThe me too movement you know the meat you know this whole ... thing and I'm not a huge fan of the hashtags and the slogans and the movements and that step I don't think you are to\nWe like to be free thinkers we conservatives don't like to follow the herd we don't like to follow a a a trend we don't like to be a part of a movement and must that movement is about individual liberty and freedom which ultimately is anti movement right\nUh that's the dichotomy of being a conservative and someone who wants freedom is that your your your joined a movement\nTo push for independence and the whole idea of independence is that you don't have to be part of a movement\nSo I'm at but that said I have great respect for women who do step forward\nAnd accused horrible people doing horrible things and the me too movement inspired by the Harvey Weinstein situation was so completely and totally different than what we saw with Kevin ... are these were women\nWho were not acting politically who we are not attacking a person for his politics probably agreed with him on his politics in fact his politics is what probably protected Harvey Weinstein in many ways\nBecause he gave to all the right causes and and donated all all the right of feminist politicians so he could you could wear the mantle of feminist Harvey wouldn't do that he loves women after all he donates to Planned Parenthood which is\nThe most despicable statement one could ever make if you really love and care about women the last thing you would do is give money to Planned Parenthood but that's how the left thinks that's how Hollywood things\nAnd the me too movement as it it came forward under Harvey Weinstein and some of the other allegations of Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and they're all Democrats have you noticed\nThere all liberals there all the girl and the media for that matter but what they had in common that we didn't see in the Kavanaugh a proceedings was that there was immediately a floodgates opened up\nOther valid corroborated\nCompletely credible allegations what we saw with Kavanaugh were a couple of other allegations led by the likes of Michael ...\nThere were completely on credible ... locked any ... any consistency\nBut what you saw with the Kavanaugh thing was the politicization of the me too movement you saw me to used as a political weapon to destroy somebody because ultimately they didn't like their politics it was just the last quiver in their\n... wait the left arrow in their quiver you know what I mean\nIt was the last weapon at their disposal they tried everything else got\nKnows during those confirmation hearings and this one they secretly surreptitiously held back and then threw it out there as their final attack\nThat's all it was and it was despicable and it was dishonorable\nAnd it went against everything that we in America stand for innocent until proven guilty due process\nAnd when I talked to women they were outraged at the Democrats about that\nAnd then something happened first of all Democrats aren't talking about it anymore which tells me you know they get it and they think that this was a loser for them if they spend too much time money focusing on it\nBut then I had a I mentioned that I'm from Michigan My brother and one of my brother's still live up to my brother's still the Michigan one of them lives in the

national credit card relief would like to give you free information on a proven debt forgiveness program\nThis program has been used by thousands to legally forgive millions and an secured that it's not bankruptcy\nSince when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in the I think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't\nThey keep coming why because we let them in\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat\nSenator Ben carton\nAh he is the senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country last lesson 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\n[noise] well one one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan by Democrats or Republicans if President Trump's budget or we want to prove the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nHere and he goes on on this and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the ah highest level\nStatesmanship in Washington DC we've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable wise old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n\n... we're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter Honduran that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in let's say about that for a minute you're an elected official you've been elected by your\nPopulation in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them you've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who are elected you are fleeing your country to go elsewhere\nAnd your response is not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country you know your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my an apt corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing their home and then you've got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables vets who enables that by throwing more money\nAt it\nI came back we went back and forth on this earlier today and if you want you can get the whole interview over at a my radio station W male dot com but I I came back around and I said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these for\nOkay there on the way and frankly whatever money you send down there you've already spent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for ... he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\nWell I don't know if I'll agree with you on that statement I I I've been embedded with the FBI down a Central America I Know how dangerous the birds are\nBy the way I real fast for me just to be ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nYou find you you you you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years the came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states the step sister gangs including in Maryland so I I I understand the the danger factor as relates to these gang activities I think most of the family's just show up in our border\nOr people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America and some cases the Abbott legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nWell if they have a legitimate claim for a song that claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper vetting\nOkay been better hold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate claim\nThat I agree with you I'm not I don't disagree with you one\nAnd then I'm going to pose a permanent 'cause that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republicans are doing this all the time\nThey say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate and we need to follow international protocols for asylum\nSeeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum ... living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum otherwise my friends in Chicago would be claiming asylum in Toronto right now\nSo the ... that but that's all they'll say they'll say well you know the economic it's a horrible economic and they've got a horrible drug problem that horrible gang problem you're right but that's not a legitimate claim asylum so if that's the reason for coming they need to be turned around they can't be let in that's not a silent\nBetter economic opportunities browse herself so what do we do with them\nWell ... what we have been doing with them a prior to the Trump administration's would turn out we we we either if they're from Mexico they returned to Mexico there from Central America we fly back to Central America\nReally that's not actually what's been happening at all as you know you see because they come in here and they claim asylum even though they're not supposed to be eligible for asylum\nAnd what happens then\nAs soon as they cross the border and they're stopped by border patrol and they say oh I Want asylum you know what happens then\nWhy get into what I Am play a little bit more of this is important for you to hear because this is the thought process this is the danger in Washington when people don't take this seriously I got more keep it here Larry O'Connor in for the great one

guess caravan it'd be a word or somebody who doesn't want to put the right word on it but let's face it we've got thousands of people marching on our border\nA jury box in their own country that even caring American blacks to try to show any any kind of support for the country that they're about to invade by any other definition I realize there may or may not be weapons involved but by any other definition that of the conquest\nAnd um I guess what I'd like that's the liberals out there who think they know that there are some ... some of this I Want to ask them if there's somebody fixing your door and says my family is starving I'm here to take all your money and all of your food what are you gonna do you're going to call them\nYou're on a weapon or you just gotta why are there and let them rub your mind because I think actually what strikes that happened on a large scale ... [noise]\nIt it is and listen as it's not a conquest because they're not you know overthrowing our governments but but it is an invasion nonetheless they're they're not looking to to well I mean that probably by the power of their vote they're looking to overturn\nA our way of life or through the ballot box but their first intention is to just invade and to ah take from our country whatever they want including the federal benefits and state benefits listen I'm with you\nThat there is no ... you described it perfectly when you've got thousands and thousands of people demanding entry into your country and they're waving the flag of their nation that you're being invaded and then the thank God the president is it doesn't care what CNN has to say about him he is going to defend that border\nUh Pete thank you thank you for the call the problem here is the president doesn't have the support he needs\nThe the the there's there are some things the president can do here but you know listen if if if Republicans do lose\nThis election coming up at the midterms in many ways they're going to have themselves to blame in that the one most powerful motivating issue that President Trump or rode into office on\nIf you can name one thing the Trump stood for it was enforcing our borders and building a wall to protect our southern border do no two ways about this I Know that there was a lot else going on in this election\nOr the the uh antipathy for Hillary Clinton or the you know decades of of her\nInvading our living rooms in a very shrill and unlike away or the idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton or the promise to tax cut the rejection of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake and the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside for a minute if you asked the men on the street named me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be\nBuilding that wall and protecting our border and Republicans I understand why in some cases but Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you it's because the Democrats stood on the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell you lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do not want\nOur immigration laws enforced as they're written [noise] war it's because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected I don't know anybody\nWho votes thinking yeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection\nI I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them and get their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn and forcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next up I'm Larry O'Connor infer mark I live in hey Darryl\nHow're you doing guys though I've watched I've watched\nThe border over the years grew up in a Chandler, Arizona and you know they actually had a ... year they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know [laughter] you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they've got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens\nAnd then you have people standing in line trying to do it the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think whoa don't work so back to the Israelis [laughter]\nWell I remember when I was younger and people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that\nMovie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong who was born in east LA you remember that and it was a parody song and they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him\nOn the run from border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him right\n... ... oh if only that really were the case in fact what what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean they have been there forever I mean obviously not no longer with us but uh\nIt just ... it's slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became lighter and lighter on the consequences you know when you get here and then now they're actually given the benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five kids go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them\nAnd it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I did get a hold on I'm sure there's a lot\nThere here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding\nAnd they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they've got a job\nThat means they buy their lied\nAbout their documentation or they were using fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument\nIs that complete and total nonsense\nIf someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes they are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had bit surely and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares about keeping our laws enforced\nOr speaking of east LA let's go to Kent in Los Angeles where my my adopted my my first adopted home now Washington is my second adopted home you're like sitting on the great age seven to the answer Carol a or a tense what do you make of this\nAll
