B. S. that MPs is somehow consulting with Trump to decide what to do ahead of time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine a Judeo Christian ethic we believe and due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nBy the Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKicked him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's gonna come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no\nThis is the ah the event there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen the past several months to Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and some how large this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen as possible but it goes on and on I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs is on speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots\nTo use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is they pitched enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back\nTo the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies\nNow Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gay and stupidly they decide to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things were heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and or Montana the president is going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media say wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can have that so they started this other thing about ... who was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage the MS Thirteen\nWith are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what this is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the house I have no idea so let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one

you\nI keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we're going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system as I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flip through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point of Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will do this and that state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three\nHe will not stop they will not nominate you could nominate but they went out confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental\nSecondly all the investigations\nIf the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely the investigations of every aspect of Trump's live his wife's life\nJared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens it's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another\nAspect of course is foreign policy right now despite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good north\nKorea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by\nThe Iranians and by Brock Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria foreign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you want the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachment and it hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with him on a play you some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically and confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be like all the tweets dry like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivized the mob by buying them all for paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles and Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue

recently I'm John Brennan the last past two days and then NBC confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think [noise]\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the

A. G. A. had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nOh would have been the cop store for a week and I think you bring up a good point who do you think the left is wanting the fat and quick or a journalist that one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are mad about that don't like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to\nRush to the case of of one of their own who works at the Washington Post rather than a sort of our of our um police officers\nIsn't that a parent I mean ... why do we spend\nI mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it I imagine it right now it's the biggest story on CNN and MSNBC holidays as about Chris choking 'cause showed ... went to Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better or is it ... or was it\n... or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder of re most in lieu and what that said\nAbout Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter whoever cater to murder of police officers and when the L. M. got what they want and what are we went dead cops when even when I'm now in ... were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Alice was murdered and a barge down Kentucky ambush Kelly we don't know who did it\nAnd at this point what is in the media spent time instead of a show geek in Turkey take up the calling\nOf a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform\nAnd spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered re most who was killed according to the black nationalist\nHe said that he wanted to come and killed police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner and so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill\nA police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department than Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers short fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown\nWho was an armed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson\nAnd grab his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven but the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder national is the ... down ...

selling a book or doing a business deal\nAnd we've established a bit of a friendship I'm happy to defend that great man and ABC News George Stephanopoulos or on CNN I have a lot of feelings for the president to forty five Donald J dropping\nA Mr President before we get too deep into this money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live\nAnd she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're gonna have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out [noise]\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is\nWith everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nMany jobs you're talking to my every time I can in Mexico we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent\nIf people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries they have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing Eucharist because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and it has said that's okay I'm going to tax you cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately have a plan and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nThis opportunity

the other issue\nThat I spoke with rich Samantha and Richard ... a little bit about earlier and that is\nThe first lady who say classy woman who's trying to do good things millennia cannot catch a break from anybody at any point in time right shouldn't immediate traits are completely unfairly and\nSo the last day or two after the president one is a federal court case against Michael ... and a Stormy Daniels president used the term horse face to describe Stormy Daniels and when he did that the media especially Brian seltzer and tapper and others is CNN went crazy\nMelt down over the horse face common awful it was and this wasn't about a woman\nThere so it was about women in general see what CNN artfully does is take the comments about one person\nAnd generically apply to everyone in the group because they believe in group rights group identity so in this case horse face ... describes Stormy Daniels according to the president and the media had a virtual meltdown for a day day and a half on\nThe president using the term horse face described Stormy Daniels\nThat it came out a couple of days ago the TI the rapper is doing an awful video\nWhich are two packs a ... a Trump is a stripper in the oval office\nAnd I saw about three seconds of it that was it for me and I'm not going to watch it\nHowever CNN spent little or no time on the issue that now important rappers or using millennia Trump in a strip her outfit engage in sexual acts in the oval office as if she was working for Bill Clinton\nSo I'm waiting now for the first ladies that are still alive like Roslyn Carter or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama or Laura Bush the former ranks around malaria and Trump and said this is a bridge too far you can't sexual ours our first lady\nFor commercial benefit and get away with it which is the late night topics of coal bear and the Jimmy's you hear it constantly sexual ... making fun of the brilliant first lady we have millennia Trump\nSo how is it worthy of constant unrelenting criticism when a porn star\nIs called horse faced by the president\nBut when I first lady is depicted as a stripper engaged in sexual acts in the oval office\nThat somehow that it's not worthy of being covered\nAnd that's the other first ladies stood on envelop her\nIn fact have you seen any efforts by Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama to spend time and to make more legitimate interview the mainstream media she's legitimate with me mommy Trump whose by far the most brilliant\nFirst lady we've ever had she speaks five or six languages she's wonderful\nBut the media will not allow her to be the president's wife\nWithout sexual I sing her calling Aaron ignoramus doesn't speak correctly that does speak the English well enough for Stephen Colbert there who makes fun of her\nA constant basis so if we lived in a fair country was fair media you know media calling balls and strikes\nYou would have criticisms against those in Hollywood and entertainment industry\nWho wants to sexual lies and make the legitimate and minimize or first lady throughout the world and you would have the other first ladies the other flow does this coming together to say stop it don't do it can you imagine just think for a moment\nIf some country star\nFour or five years ago sexual allies Michelle Obama\nAnd put her in sexy outfits performing sex acts in the oval office but shallow bomber what do you think that view\nKobe or Hollywood the New York times every big city newspaper every magazine if they still exist websites would go absolutely crazy this would be the worst thing in the world\nTo make fun of and sexual lies the parents how Michelle Obama and it should happen I Want the same behavior that would apply to Michelle Obama do apply to a millennia Trump because they're in the same category doing the same kinds of good things may today\nEarlier today millennia Trump plane filled with smoke on her way I think to Philadelphia and she still made the trip\nThis is a brave courageous woman who's married to a great president but the media wants to make the legitimate both diminish who they are and make them objects of scoring and ridicule because it plays well I guess what the audience is an audience out there for this\nYou know about fifty percent of the country loved the guy in fifty percent loads and made him the dislike and the hatred for Bush was nothing compared to this and so I'm waiting for the pack receipt the stop\nAnd for the news coverage to begin\nOne more big our roommate remain so to\nBack to the causes time

Sochi guy um I don't think\nI'm anything's going to work with these people anymore they've gone down so far the left they've gone down to the gutter but what they've been doing that even though the president is not running there are a lot of people that are coming our way now and I don't think anything's gonna work for them that disgusting\nAnd they'd file and uh everybody needs to get out there and and\nIt's amazing if involving Trump probably got twenty eight percent of the vote in New York City but I'm On a bed among ranger fans who got Seventy percent\nYou know\nWe got to run Scott thanks for your call one more quick call then we'll take a break let's go to Kim and ...

this guy history he joined the Muslim Brotherhood back in the Nineteen seventies he had the same had the same ideology that\nThat they have today about um you know bringing out here to the country and he worked for the Saudi royal family for years as an editor on one of their papers so he has a history with the family and I think that a turkey doesn't like\nPresident Trump anyway so\nThat I like I like to see that a bad stuff they keep saying that they have\nAnd I really don't know if I Would even trust the information and it happened at the consulate in Turkey so it should be their investigation\nRight yeah I heard the ... and nearly the consulate in Saudi Arabia territory really are and so but I I talk about Christopher Stevens was US ambassador to Libya murdered\nSean Smith Tyrone Woods in Glen Dougherty we're all American citizens\nThey weren't didn't ever green card and the media largely ignored that in twenty twelve because it was so injurious to Obama's reelection if they would have focused on that for the last eight weeks Mitt Romney would have won but the media couldn't do that because they wanted to make sure their guy one\nExactly and I think Americans because they need to stop watching what's going on and frankly I don't think anybody murdered I don't care or from Saudi Arabia turkey wherever or when you say\nThat I really think that they need to let this play out let the investigation happened what Saudi presented the information on whatever it is on it so I didn't want to stay at ready to get out the vote because we have a great president and I back in the thousand percent and we have to keep the house and Senate\nAnd we have to help our president 'cause he's he's banner fire for three years off\nKim thank you very much for your call we continue
