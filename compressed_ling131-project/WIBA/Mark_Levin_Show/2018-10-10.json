the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some ... substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump notch you one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle has been won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China that takes about\nFive hundred billion dollars a year so the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harassment and it came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration or federal I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only has stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world and it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated in jail undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh\nKind of look ... looked over Trump and said that's my model\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other whip the middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his uh all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a lawyer Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he he in a sense hypnotic late took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after Christine Ford testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine Ford was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one ever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when\nShe was in her late teens and the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said at the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her she she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the mid Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door with support and not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes or boyfriend or many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment to the fight is over it's only just begun you fool we got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer\nIn charge of the

John please go ahead\nAnd show them following this thing for intently from start to where it is now and ah absolutely I agree with your opening bottle first off\nAre stubborn things you know and and the words of our of our\nOur our president you know John Adams a you know if you're just dissect it and look strictly at ...\nAnd you go off the values of the country that you don't proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling you cannot wait to no kidding a conclusion oh this guy he's guilty\nAnd you know John last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a bread Kevin isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this was in a case and this wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine to give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christina for down to ... path when she oddly question her about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector tests and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\n... what what the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend protecting a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward to the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governors administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically every thing\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taking airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine of forward lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that that is the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic actually allow\nThat terrified because you're now I take somebody a lesser degree or a lesser income in life or whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just they're all coming back or something like that there could be no coming back\nWhether whether you know just the fear factor and it could be absolutely at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell will join orders Brett Kavanaugh will go to get back his reputation here in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the four witnesses she possessed supplied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about embarrassed that in the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight [laughter] that would that would be a hell of a road and wouldn't come back you know but then again I wouldn't get their due process went at it from such a thing\nYou know John I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what a or someone stole my Chevrolet\nI'm not going to question you just said he wanted someone feel for no it was a share of her life so if you go in and say my left foot turning I'm not going to say what do what you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault ten to twenty percent of the time there\nAre false allegations of sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project\nOr called eight six six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight Bible menace your dot com or eight six six eighty eight Bible\nLiberal elites without some common sense from Muslim\n\n\n\nWhen\nI was thinking I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear about\nThe norms and the presidency let's talk about norms of presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was that normal\nHow about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky\nThan he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three increased taxes increase Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is that the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms of the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered\nThat Nixon violate the norms of the presidency with water grade in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency\nViolated the norms of the presidency so please save me the embarrassment\nOf trying to convince me that Trump is somehow violating the norms of the presidency as if Obama and Bush and Clinton and Bush\nAnd LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms of the presidency please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach chair and go ahead\nI I just wanted to I'm a thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley who you're around are that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nUm strong personalities who wanted to pull any direction they courage cars as much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you may have shown as your question talking about the norms and all I'm Liz listening liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the President's Day by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how 'bout Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do you think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November owning a member of the eight twenty sixteen but he may not get it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party except that the outcome of the twenty sixteen election and aren't having they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse and worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that Jeanette bringing his country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I think it's as far as I say stack\nHow about accepting the results of the election whether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should've resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but what happened is\nThat that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which is being guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more of it if we have the trade deficits we used to have a candidate in Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they ripped off for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nFar this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is abnormal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with\nYou and I also did test that that they will not acknowledge anything good anything can be as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has done Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm I'm perfect\nKnow he never did that so he tried he tried hard hard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it well I have respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today\nSharon we got her run thank you for calling from Pennsylvania and is Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote\nIf you do not want Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last half of the president's first term get out and vote for continuous more a seven seven three one two three one one still counting on the great American in for the gray one mark\n\nFinally gave a new development mom from health care they give you the power to the very worst when you pay ... the experience guarantee damage apes experience guarantee\nHave any bearing the clinic says to me that patients will tell us about a year in class we'll refund some or all if you're out of pocket costs associated with your visit co pay to get the bump you get them back you know Clinton Boston\nIs no ordinary things where both revolutionary put your money where our mom I promise you mean well cared for and every way they can get\nEvery name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false\nEvery factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I think what happened Jeannie in reality\nIs that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor you are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help\nFor your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nBut Dr believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist has that Christine for dead and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys you tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that happened\nI Believe something fundamentally bad happened ... Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years and probably\nBut she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys try do rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens it became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn in Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold the therapist who rented a room in our house\nThat caused sort of put the second front door in our house so patients could come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties then ... and her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime Dianne Feinstein office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward\nAnd one that said it said when the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers or so perfect for um her response is drew out\nI'm feeling some sympathy say we're absolutely perfect um to make you on her side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys that tried to write a paper\nAnd that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident didn't damage your life so much you didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate didn't damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years at Palo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written or co authored sixty one books and periodicals\nWhat would she would have done Seventy one books in periodicals there's no evidence that affected our life at all and every factual statements she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other they have all been proven not to occur\nAnd Gina you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party do you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think a man should be the leader of the house um I\nBelieve it you know you you can't say that you can't say that you can't say I think that I did I\nKnow that's terrible I'm a Democrat to please Jeannie ... don't do that because men and women are equal in fact women are ... you know the best people I've known in my life or women whether it's my wife my sister my mom passed away about five years ago my\nGranddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told as a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women\nWhen I think about women I think about my wife for forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio I think about my sister who's the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think about my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect the women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and immunities ever every citizen\nBut I also want to say that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault and due process\nFerrets out the good from the bad the right from the wrong and then we from the chaff\nI went Mendez do processed rights because that guarantees down the road that wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense the me too movement there's nothing wrong with me too movement\nAs long as rights and due process goes along with it\nAnd if somebody's charge why there is a title nine violation or rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my wife groped or my sister growth that's disgusting and if somebody groups a woman\nI Want them to be held to account but every now and then a woman like Christina forward either doesn't know the truth or tell us ally and when that happens I Want the presumption of innocence to make sure it's available for innocent victims who've been charged such as bread cabinet\nBrett Kavanaugh as one of the biggest victims in this whole thing would you agree\nOh absolutely I I mean I agree with you I don't think women should not be protected they needed up on a pedestal\nAbsolutely I I have more respect for women than men\nNeil Armstrong and Neal said why do you want my picture [laughter] I said\nWell Neal you know you walk on them and they were the first man to walk on the moon is so I ... I got the picture and immediately hurried off and um that was it and other people came up their picture taken with him and he was uneasy didn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer\nHe didn't see himself as a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years at University of Cincinnati in the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher a great professor very bright\nBut when you see the University of Cincinnati approach them do named the school of engineering that Neil Armstrong school of engineering\nBut that makes sense\nBut that makes sense that named the school of engineering after Cincinnati so Neil Armstrong answer it but yes but Neal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months\nHe left you see and what he did at that point\nWas simply serve on boards of directors had a farm in orange county which is a county north of Cincinnati and used to see 'em out now and then it events but nobody would ever know that that was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo in the movie comes out on friday you're going to see\nThe actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and that was difficult it was to go to the moon and Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance he would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement telling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it\nAnd that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful and living was less than fifty fifty but Neal\nTook that risk in fact in Lebanon other men took it over the next three years\nAnd we're not going back to the moon since [noise] continue with your call\nBack to the topic was a talk show hosts\nNumber to call his eight seven seven three one three eight one one\nTo see that movie is a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments still counting of the great American wretched income\nOr\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the conservative alternative to A.

crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office so he's been in office one day this morning\nAt his first couple hearings and the Democrats already won with peach and they don't want to teach them what they want to do is raise money to use and Heidi Heitkamp straits in North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly and Indiana that's what they want to do they or\nJoining to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of the of the house and two thirds of the Senate it would never happen\nAnd if ... if there's a God and having the Republicans will keep the Senate for weeks Trump tonight will know better that are so that the federal judges the pipeline can't continue but imagine the absurdity of the modern Democratic Party when having had his

an excellent point you know that the party of the confederacy\nIs and was the Democratic party they're the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so that Democratic Party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan\nAs the party of Jim Crow Democratic Party is the party of lynchings the Democratic party's the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system\nIt's responsible for most of the criminal disasters is say like in the city of Chicago the Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings\nCollapse of public education in fact about eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students\nThat are African American read at the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a

system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing of the Democratic party\nThe communist right yesterday's left us today center today's left will be tomorrow center that talking about the whole American political system moved to the left\nSo they have a highly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician\nThere are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so what you see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian probe you see the violence and Ryan ... and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain this to also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional champ telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so they organize left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence and our government a foreign agent of red China like congressman Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about a ... as a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh are allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than than numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nI I never thought I Would embrace a political guy as much as I I I Love

committee chairs\nOkay so you were talking about what happens if the Democrats win and and one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let 'em have how even how to speak because uh the committee heads have\nSubpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slug Jerry ... are taking over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nWould be terrible\nI mean what I mean what legislation would pass what activities on our behalf whatever occur if jury ... learn Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of it even if we got a mute Mueller out of the picture oh Gees they would\nThey would just

side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can wise you can't try to ... people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person because the reason\nYeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not to vote for him and just being is not in about it but engage them and tried to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose at Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta O'Rourke is that possible\nUh it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um\nYou know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know he was young and yeah he's a you know some people I guess finding physically attracted eight different strokes for different folks whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd yeah there there's obviously some liberal natives here in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most of most of Texas has you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal there ... yeah yeah but ah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so\nUh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've ... we've got to have him where\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with them from New York\nFrom the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore I'm moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs gonna be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but\nYou know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can get elected\nIf in Florida and\nNew York ... began to be as one in uh Texas looks the same electorally as New York then we're done because Texas and Florida will tip this thing permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nAnd I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected\nHe would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done\nAnd you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president\nI think he's in Iowa denied he hopefully obey out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Orange County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys the messiah a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't add the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm or whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and\nIf you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circa twenty oh three this guy's a rock star and when he shows up in your town\nIt's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to write that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what my eyes are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith has behind Trump as a president\nOr not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald it smell and know the odds got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have confidence fate and just do what we need to do individually to help this kind of get back to where it needs to\nImagine if Hillary

Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states because the average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida\nCouldn't look I didn't like what they were seeing on TV and you had a candidate promising law and order and are working on behalf of the moral majority in the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon did in sixty eight Seventy two\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you were a chump pre says the rules of civility or suspended because Republicans control the Congress and watch the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is a blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points independent voters

in Dallas in Baton Rouge and all over the country\nYou might recall that brought Hussein Obama into the White House took the founders and representatives del Rey because there's\nA black lives matter is if they had a point to make the cops are racist murderers systemically which is not the case every now and then you have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago were top should not have shot that boys sixteen times every now and then you have something bad happened\nThe one point one one percent out of Ninety nine point nine percent when cops do water right\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cup occasionally does something wrong the argument for the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there not worthy of being protected and loved you not worthy of our
