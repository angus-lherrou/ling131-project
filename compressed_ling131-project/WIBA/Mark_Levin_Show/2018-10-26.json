I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't a minister producer\nThere was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Fort incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of\nThese things the president was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place\nOn so much of this now that said I told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's fully open it's fully open\nThat Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stain yesterday at least for the first to the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things and the president us than any politician does\n\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute area just spend an hour talking about it you can

Heilemann higher and higher and higher them in any way a\n\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called that word cut five go\nBut I Do now in my heart that President Trump bears a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that laid it almost inevitable that top Democrats and the lady I Would think targeted this is an unusual kind of ...\nGo ahead\nOf the reasons that it is their way into so the president's rhetoric ... stock market\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense ...\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nOr like Jay moron in some

you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner go ahead\n... causes I think what you have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nThis is the president is called the media the enemy is hateful and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people in their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and the federal judge was murdered I remember those since ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media and then you\nDon't call us the enemy of the people of course one off the enemy of the

who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he is very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists did is they arrange a number of excursion one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at\nA he was posing as a contractor try to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the quite handle that I mean people hear about the camel to take a day to go to the movie tickets for at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so\nHe gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that injures wide about that but now there's been evident that showed that but then those same\nLobbyist also arranged a luxury for night stay and the Costa Rica villa which ended up talking about a thousand dollars a free Andrew and his wife a an addition some other folks and again the injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyists it two million dollar deal that they were looking for and so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that\nViolate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby is God a exactly what they were paying for it so that's really the way the government run it's corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has he lied to the country on Sunday night when I brought it up about that\nBen documents came out almost immediately that refuted is denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line or the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart in the law you understand the stuff\nWith an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential dry like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now only read that you would do such a ...\nOf course nobody knows the peace in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people and him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean that bad that might just be gr um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put it in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrew is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting do mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agent around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow
