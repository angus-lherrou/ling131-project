consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to

another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said and now I've gone through and look these are firing offenses but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\n\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this\nThey\nWant a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright\nCitizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again Mike ... is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statute that goes there will be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue that Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it\nOr what have been done already they said the same people in Congress who refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws\nSuddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why pass a statute if in fact as the laugh says on some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case that house a statue gonna ... statute won't fix it\nBecause they're saying you have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did outside the constitution now we're told we have to pass\nA constitutional amendment helps there\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss says Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country in the sixties and seventies then Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nThe bureaucracy\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we feel men in the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle over Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what

opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a Planned Parenthood on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers match and his best known for offering a big gun control bill and\nOn the issue of coal\nOh as to say is that he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion\nConservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win on election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you to because he not only support to he doesn't trust Joe mansion and I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and whites and waits to see if he can throw a safe boat\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about that is\nYou're
