strong evidence of ancestry now and the series of events that unfolded yesterday\nYou had the Boston Globe that I Believe was the first to kind of lose their gored over the past she really is a Native American\nAnd I don't think they actually ended up really looking into the whole thing they simply don't why she she's got evidence that the Boston Globe even\nMiscalculated battling only by a factor of about a thousand how much native blood she may have in her but\nThey weren't the only wants to run with it is is CNN they ran with it do here's an extra Rob story there's yesterday\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA Analysis showing she has distant Native American ancestry and an apparent attempt to preempt further questions and attacks should she run for president in twenty twenty\nOr and first face scrutiny for her purported Native American heritage during her twenty twelve sit in a race but president Donald Trump has revived an amplified the controversy as he eyes weren't as a possible rival frequently mocking her with a name Pocahontas\nBut Warren has now been documented and ended up paying documentation of baggage per family lore and and now it's just a ... genetic data performed by Carlos Bustamante and all of that name to write bustamante\nThe name of credibility a professor of genetics at Stanford and an advisor to ancestry and twenty three and me in a row out video what bell warns heritage the Massachusetts Democrat as seen sitting behind a laptop as she calls bustamante\nNow the president likes to call my mom a liar or and ask him\nWhat do the facts say a bustamante a response the facts that jazz that you absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree isn't that the way that humans to talk to one another by the way\nPedigree is that when we're usually like talking about a breed of an animal not this is just\nI have never in in the context of this conversation and whether it's in my family or with somebody else and talking about their ancestry or your your pedigree you told me about your your pedigree so anyway bustamante talks of her pedigree\nWarranted show Donnie bustamante for a board now posted on warns website along with others supporting documents in interviews detailing her background according to the report\nOh this is just kind of a minor detail here the majority horns identifiable ancestry is European oh however the report it however the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence\nBustamante is analysis places wards Native American ancestry between six generations ago with a report estimating eight generations\nUh okay so let's say go get something here\nIs where the Boston Globe and they're they're mad\nGot off track by the way really got off track trying to figure out a the the six to ten generations okay so if maybe\nYou there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say a generations ago what would that equal here and the answer\nElizabeth Warren as it turns out his moral lily white men Whitey white folk like perhaps you and me that is what the experts have actually been able to find after they dug into the report on our website whoops now all throughout the course of the day\nI have heard from my my friends still lives here in the in South Florida as I've been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the doors of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average leftist wannabe socialist\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren commonly received the question will why is it why is it that this is even an issue well the first thing happens to be she just didn't want to get into it and she was already ... nobody told her to go out there and get oh actually President Trump did\nPresident Trump did in fact uh do you have cut three ready\nFor public I [noise] think of that [noise]\nThe great [noise] tribal heritage what tribe is it a let me think about that one [noise] they time see space or life on being a minority [noise] oh God if they always want me to apologize for saying it [noise] and I hear why do I want to apologize I'll use tonight\nI Apologize for you [laughter] [laughter] oh God this I won't go\n[noise]\nOh it's costing our problems you know that name because now even the liberals who say they get\nThere you go\nTo the test they always entertaining and Russians Donald J Trump president of the United states at a rally back in July she took a test so she's the one who put it back out there you have to wonder\nIf they think that the president prompting her like that you think she was like I'd rather take the test and then he or she supposed to be id\nLeague educated right when you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results if you're a test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then there's ...\nActually no you are a wider than the average white folk here in the United states just saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down to ball now in the end the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kind of smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck asking junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nWho coined DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage\nSuch as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations oh by the way using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nAnd makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's a legitimate use as well also this honoring the legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nAnd once again boom goes\nThe dynamite any questions yeah you can have the the president the United states re forward to Elizabeth Warren a bad book on us as he might say as a fraud but we only have to do\nIs listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation that she claims to be\nBorn up Google already fraud\nOh by the way the details you know these little things so part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of and throughout the day is well I mean what difference does it make any way in Trump's tax returns okay let's talk about the the tax return thing real quick\nSo let's say that at worse you think he got something on Trump's tax returns here's a person who lies literally about who she is and always has\nAnd the problem is for folks who say well I mean but who did it hurt old but it wasn't it wasn't a victimless crime there had been problems here as a matter of fact she's used it every step but the way\nTo gain benefit in law school to gain career benefit to identifying as a minority now\nSomewhere there is someone who was supposed to obtain the type of benefit that the bad Pocahontas received by virtue of her using her bow\nIndian status to obtain financial benefits to obtain status to obtain a position in the program that she wouldn't have otherwise would take every step of her career path was a fraud\nA fraud so yes there are victims the people that never had the opportunities and for that matter what are the odds that has she never had those opportunities by virtue of her fraud committed against all these institutions\nWhat are the odds that she would have been in a position to become a United States senator and the first place to science histories one side effects\nAgain the president it calls or the bad book on as he calls or fraud but when the secretary of the Cherokee Nation does\nNow to be ready for it to us I guess for space\nThat that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit of a leader in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan part whatever this is three point oh\nThat is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president waiting out\nThe United states has strongly informed the president upon doors that it'd be large caravan of people heading to the U. S. is not stopped and brought back to endorse no more money or aid will be given to Honduras affected immediately well thank you this is the one thing I've never understood about foreign aid\nWhy is it that we give foreign aid to countries this girl is over and over and over\nOf ... we give them a billion and a half bucks per year\nAre we getting a billion and a half books dot the Honduran government for\nSo they take it\nSend their people out to try to cross the border is\nUnreal but anyway\nPresident paying attention and if he does stuff you have\nA step one to recovering when you're

economy\nA though have you seen people get hysterical about bat die it happened during that particular interview but\nSomething has happened over the last several days that led me to go ahead and do something a little bit early when usually do this until after the general election one because it is kind of annoying to me it's like\n... the point of which were not even into September and you're going to the store and the Halloween stuff do rubbing up against the Christmas like seriously oh now oh space auditions not necessarily not yet right\nCan we not get through the mid term election before about twenty twenty or so dumb because you have really did twenty twenty election that story\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings because remember the only reason we have Spartacus was because of

Cory Booker Spartacus who who went to Iowa imagine what that's like by the way\nYou imagine if someone like Cory Booker\nMarching into Iowa\nI mean ... the first thing is just think about how much your elitist leftist load since the Centre part of the kind of fly every country in Ninety six percent of the land mass of the United states of America is red\nYou start taking a look at where some majority that is so you here you have Spartacus marching into I Want to test the waters over the weekend I mean seriously yeah Kamala Harris holding her nose in reading California to go to the south she went to South Carolina\nImagine how painful that is for her\nAnd of course why do we have to be the test the Native American ancestry test by one\nReferred to occasionally as Elizabeth Warren really bad Pocahontas it's ultimately because she's also running right now for twenty twenty now she might have just taken herself out of it we we shall see although who knows when in democratic ranks this might be a rallying call\nBut because all of this is going on and you even have the president of the United states being asked about twenty twenty on a near daily basis I feel the need to tell you this president Donald Trump will likely be reelected\nThere you know a few ... odds are he's reelected now\nBefore you just said they're going that sounds pretty baseless no way you say anything to do with the economy is not anything to do with all the record improvements that we've been saying\nHere's the first reason why the odds are in his favor he's an incumbent president running for reelection so let's start their sixty five percent of presidents who run for reelection when\nAnd in order not to when you have to be as lame is kept in the night before mentioned Jimmy Carter or you have to do something like read my lips\nNo new taxes and then raise taxes they get yourself a Ross Perot and it splits about\nComing up I Will give you a little bit of the background about that sixty five percent and we'll get into some what's going on in Saudi Arabia as well it is a it's festive we we have a lot to talk about we're just getting warmed up I Am by mud in for the great one mark all of it [noise]\n\n\nBuddy who went into that building happens to there is an unholy alliance we've had for quite some time and it's been with Saudi Arabia nail in the context of Saudi Arabia it seems like we're making a lot of\nProgress I made sure women could drive yeah\nI mean come on right there like a totally cool people\nI mean just want to talk about who human rights I mean Saudi Arabia yeah women women could drive now might even let them getting a a little education I mean shoot it mightily isn't it fascinating because you you have this new\nYounger king who who's like yeah look may women's rights you may drive uh-huh and you have to laugh but that's kind of like around around them they knew king's like this celebrity\nIn Hollywood and a lot of them think he's super cool now one thing they might not think it's too\nIs Sheree a law now little detail about sharia law it's evil\nAnd when I get a little background here in a just a minute about some of what still goes on with Saudi Arabia\nAnd a lot of the other Middle Eastern governments\nBy the way I Am ... I Am your South Florida friend\nI Do a morning show W. J. you know in West Palm Beach I Do a mid morning show because you just can't get enough of me and four hours in South Florida so do another one up and said until noon W. I. O. D. in Miami and uh it is truly an honor and pleasure to be here anytime I I Am able to join you filling in for\nThe great one more call then by the way you can catch me\nAt Bryan mud radio on Twitter now\nWrapping up last hour I mentioned that President Trump\nWas likely to be reelected if for no other reason than he is an incumbent president running for reelection historically sixty five percent for nearly two thirds of all incoming presidents who run we'll win\nUltimately what we have is a presidential election it's about the incumbent president so frankly it'll really doesn't matter first and foremost whether it's Spartacus or Pocahontas or whatever\nIt matters who\nIn what Donald Trump is represents what he's accomplished you really have to screw up you really have to screw up in order to be an incumbent president and lose if you're running for re election I'm going to come back around to this Saudi Arabia and thing here in a minute\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and there's just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake to me like you you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting down in contacts you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again I mean yes you can have new\nVoters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration at from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election\nWell yes up or did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote oh by the way probably not\nTo make the news anywhere even stateside and do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there my point being even to the extent that we've seen people for me\nThe partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people going out registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua twenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy in a generation I never voted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better\nThey went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go well I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then he got surmise that are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nIn Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low on\nNow oh by the way but you also had the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there it is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year\nWhen you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated two sides to stories on the side effects Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but\nSee a benefit for the tax got well that's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit for the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just wanted\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states prior to Donald Trump becoming president\nThat was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically oh these are angry white men men are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration gets what\nDoes it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd be foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is has been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states and our interest as we could have hoped for this by not even talking about all that\nMight even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under discussed\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually have had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\n... probably one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than\nWhat you thought to just today for example and Molly you had a terror attack a woman writing her donkey blown up\nIslamic terrorists earlier today in Afghanistan us for citizen citizens that were bombs by Taliban\nYou probably didn't even know that yesterday in France you had a man attack somebody with a chisel raising all probably didn't know about that\nThe events of dimes and countries like France it doesn't get way forward it every year\nThere's a lot more to that story\nSheree is that the root of it and guess what\nThey're still tenets of that in Saudi Arabia\nToward the situation becomes that much more complicated\nJust say in the conversation still just getting going on by mud in for the

he denies everything nice sized everything so\nThis is difficult it's difficult for a lot of reasons\nWe don't know the exact quote was obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks to say yeah you know wage

with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nThey have nothing but contempt for us why would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted himself [noise]\nIt's kinda like Lindsey Graham did his version of coming out isn't it\nEver since the ... there's been a whole new Lindsey Graham and he's\nHe's out these loving every minute of it I mean this is enjoyable for him I mean you sanction the hell out ally the old\n... and Lindsey Graham anyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes me not just the the idea of just say Janelle out I'm OK well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia is\nIs you know what I Know we're\nKind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know\nWe aren't feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously what happens then what happens if they say you know what we're just\nGonna go ahead and turn off this bigoted OPEC and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something that a rep the economy a little bit therefore you know president day\nAnd things that that could happen any number of different applications so I think it's easy for\nOf it enjoying this newfound freedom maybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feels that at the speed is kinda fascinating if you think about it I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh what can I came out I may be fed things that it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect me take a look at it in the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception and Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happened\n[laughter] I mean it's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom of the\nTrump effect that has come over them but it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know better let's just go sanction the hell out of all that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend who uh\nIs mysteriously well where exactly\nJamal is talking let's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if the king\nDenies any knowledge of it or not it was a body a it's obvious that he's not in the consulate anymore give us a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being tortured\nIt's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really I I don't know ... if you're going to engage in in a war game I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria ... scenarios than the least of which would be well maybe when you you how the Saudi officials leave\nWith what the president has been up to I and I had to go back in ... because there was a magazine it was that the one the Seinfeld episode where I think it was actually Kathy Griffin who ironically enough ah Jerry was talking about said that she does stink history should quit\nBut I don't want it to be because to me it should be the traditional route ears up rejection and failure until she spit out at the bottom of the porn industry\nCan help but feel like that's what's happening\nHere except in that case the stormy you know she started out in the porn industry\nYou knew of the interesting characterizations of her right\nYou know she'll she'll go from ... a certain level of decorum you know she is a an adult film star other time she is a a porn actress or whatever it's uh it's interesting but nevertheless by the way\nI Am your or south for the friend Bryan mutt doing morning show on WGN now in West Palm Beach a mid morning show after that W.
