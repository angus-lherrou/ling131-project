same United Nations that has admitted that even if you believe this crap about global warming and incidentally the science is not solid by any means\nThere's nothing you can do about it and yet somehow Trump is the single greatest threat to the earth's climate because the United nations in saying there's nothing you can do about it is also saying but you should give us trillions of dollars\nAnd Trump is saying now so I'm not sure what the United Nations thinks it's going to do about quote the earth's climate mark Moran out of climate\nDepot and the author of the politically incorrect guide to climate change a but\nPresumably it's it involves us giving the United nations trillions of dollars\nActually the ... the number that they're coming up with your besides you know if if you use current technology the gas tax bill would be\nA two hundred and forty dollars per gallon which is a Philly number by the end of the century if that's the economic mowing but nonsense but hundred and twenty two trillion dollars is what they're saying we need to do to curb global warming the limit global warming hundred and twenty two trillion dollars globally\nAnd what we get for that is still a dire scenario according to un\nAdmission models which by the way models are climate models they don't make predictions un science has been very clear they're merely a mission scenarios and they also admit that they don't account for half the ... variability in nature\nOr the whole thing is just you know it's a it's it's unbelievable that even the mainstream media takes it seriously when my favorite is that the Trump Administration is just completely ignore the report\nA and they're not even talking about it even asked the Trump Administration official yesterday and they said oh we're not even get an answer that question we're focusing on swearing and Brett Kavanaugh I mean they don't even care the latest extent this is pure propaganda from beginning to end but even if you focus\nOn their propaganda it literally you could spend a hundred and twenty two trillion dollars and that would probably happen but even the un admits that we wouldn't even wouldn't even do anything for the climate in there and they're scenarios and we also have to go to a fossil\nFree world and let me see if I have a year right I think it's a twenty thirty seven years from now for twenty fifty five that's one of their forecasts assume the entire world will be fossil fuel free by that time\nOkay so so this is not one degree and a hundred twenty two trillion dollars and living in the

pick America if in fact\nAnd I picking wealthy America not impoverished America if in fact we have to deal with some emergent climate crisis but they're in meeting what you've said all along that he does not saying they have proposed even if you believe they're bunk and their juice science\nNot saying they have proposed will do anything it won't do a damn thing it's just hey give us a bunch of money so we can make a bunch of people who have done exactly nothing good on this planet\nAnd we can make them rich and the rest of you can live miserable but there'll be living high on the hog partying with it was a tyrant in the gilded palace\nWhile the ... they're begging for spare change in in you know and eating moldy Brad\nThat's exactly right and on the science\nAnd in my book as well I actually go to the origins they're talking about this\nWe have to limit the earth to uh to degree temperature rise in one point five is even better training would be catastrophic\nIf scientists when the climate gate scandal broke they admitted in the in the email to each other that the the tutoring gold at the un towel to some kind of hard science is literally pulled from thin air they don't even

so\nI'm just north of ... if you guys are watching 'em Voskuhl belt [noise]\nThird is help so gays mills you are in this a stretch here so please take some shelter at this time it's not a tornado

extended to five Fifteen we're gonna go back to channel twenty seven whether central\nThere is a good point uh what reference if you're watching it on what a west film and we have a lot of viewers joining us there this circulation is going to be pretty much south and east of Westfield just looks like it'll move in between Westfield Ind montel oh\nSo there's a rotation spinning around this\nIf we can let you know we're looking at the reds and the green red is outbound from a scan and green as inbound so we're looking at this race here\nAnd that looks to be what the couple it would be that would be the tornado right they're suing early human on that and get some a perspective so montel you need to be in your\nIn your safe spots right now get into a basement get away from windows in Monticello as it looks like some places near Harris ah this is also so Harris Monticello\nAnd this will be working ... hours of highway twenty three and thirty nine [noise]\nOkay so this is going to continue to work north of montel oh on highway twenty two is probably where there's going to work over eventually [noise] this to me it looks like the strongest couplet I I'm going yeah let's see a role that again [noise]\nYeah that that's going to be the potential tornado here right along highway twenty three as you have that rotation here this is going to be I I have a ruler ... we can see how many miles is is from Monticello considered pull it up yeah I I'm going to change that on us but we'll see\nA\nLittle less if you guys are in Monticello area is please take shelter I immediately at this moment and get into your safe spot looks like it is the circulation about three miles\nUh west of montel though is where we have this location\nThree miles west of montel oh along highway twenty three so you guys know anyone or if you live in the montebello area on the western side this is where we have clear circulation and this is what I'm looking for\nIs some type of ... a hook echo [noise] if they know hook echoes like we have right there doesn't always mean that the tornado we're always trying to look for something like that but it does look like there's some kind of inbound\nUm scans right there so I Would say the the velocities would be strongest ran around here a long twenty three where we ... we were just said that I I Would I think twenty twenty three\nThree miles west of Monticello working northeast at thirty five miles per hour we need to be watching this sort of super cell thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado so Harris a Monticello along twenty to twenty two you guys need to take shelter\nAnd we'll put some communities in the path of this storm as well and a CEO who\nWho we have to really be concerned about most [noise]\nAnd just so um we referenced is the start of the storm doesn't look like a test the tornado would probably be the back corner here so let me re do that [noise]\nOkay [noise]\nWhere you go pretty much rain between Westfield in Monticello moving up thirty five miles per hour to the north and east uh Harris at four fifty nine Hany school at five oh to budge soon at five o nine and a nice car oh is that correct\nWish coral coral five Nineteen and then this coral elementary school at around five Nineteen and then banners men betterment at five Twenty one these are all north of montel oh but I Am on television pop on here\nBut this tornado oh to potential tornado is very close to Monticello and you need to be in or save spots at this moment\nUm and again the safe spots if we just need to go over this ... you don't have you need to get into the lowest spot of your house away from windows and then you need to cover your head\nAnd you need to do that immediately and montel if you live in ... send you have enough time to ... if you're in a mobile home or trailer park you can go into\nYour shelter which should be within a couple of miles away you need to do that right now or at least get into a place with a you know like a Walmart something better than that mobile home [noise] let's continue to looked at it thank you bye Let's look down at the honey creek one I don't want to ignore the people\nThat have been dealing with this potential tornado do we have any update because now we have\nTo stand out running it's tornado warning box\nI have not seen an update on that so [noise] ah no they looked like the costs treated their observations on the market county warning ... and uh nothing from the chat rooms\nOkay well we have nothing from the um Milwaukee let's see if we can get a scan out of the silliest so we can make our own judgment call on the honey creek storm that we're watching right now this one is the one that was a threatening bearable and reads burn through honey creek\nLooks like and I can I can add this John I'm no reports out of socks or there's some rotation will likely a flip that tornado warning expire [laughter] is what they're saying they're of further uh\nLooks like a lurch considering a tornado watch now for the area okay uh the severe thunderstorm warning in Columbia county has some a good ... or ... or ... as a good signature with it\nThey're saying so they might go warning with this one yeah they could and then again good it's a rotation in Marquette county\nOkay so let's let's go look at the Portage one so everybody was watching it on ... ... what what we're saying here this is going to expire it looks like Bob was just chatting with the national weather service this storm is expiring now we're going to focus Baltimore attention to

announce sources or anything [noise] but I did not\nGet weather updates from a couple of different sources I Would ordinarily expect to get weather updates from one weather updates on already expired tornado warning came from\nA one of the sources for news in Madison\nFor some reason the warnings were not printing off properly through our we use the Associated Press National Weather service through the Associated Press so that wasn't working properly [noise]\nUm I was you know we were confused that there was an extra storm that channel twenty seven was talking about but the guy on twenty seven\nWasn't making it clear unless you were watching that he was talking about ... anyway [noise] weather is going to be dicey for the listening area for the ... pretty much the remainder of the evening\nThat it's just strange conflation of climate conditions have\nCaused some worries if that's your thing to worry about whether we still do have a severe thunderstorm warning that is about to expire for northwestern Columbia county severe thunderstorm warning till five Fifteen for northwestern Columbia county from what\nWe know and we have now attempted to exhaust all of the resources for information that we have what we\nKnow is that's it so far right days or weeks confident that we have an about to expire severe thunderstorm warning for\nNorthwestern Columbia county only now I Believe so okay so we think that were covered on that\nUm the tornado warning did expire that we were talking about last half hour if additional severe weather conditions arise um [noise]\nWe are confident we now have um\nInformation an information stream that is rapid and up to date that we will make sure to pass along that information to ASAP it's very strange very very strange that all of the sources we typically go\nTo for our weather that everybody all everybody except twenty seven um was late on these storms so a\nSubject and if the twenty seven coverage with a little confusing it's only because the meteorologists was pointing at a screen and describing what he was pointing at and it got a little confusing on the radio so\nWe do have one more here because I was in effect what do we have to have it was the tornado warning remaining in effect until five thirty four northeastern Marquette called\nNortheastern Marquette county as a tornado warning in effect till five thirty ... that's not one of that's usually not one of the areas we typically focus on so that you know started in this or if you are a little bit outside the listening area but you're still catching our signal ... in Marquette county [noise]\nThe northern part of my cat county are also under a tornado warning 'em though I Know that we don't have a lot of penetration out into the market county area [noise] that one started though in our listening area and just now has moved on to market county\nAll right so there you go whether confusion for you not on purpose\nNot on purpose but I Do think we have straightened out coming up we're both near fresh from her debate with Tammy Baldwin will join me also still ahead how bad was the cabin our coverage\nPretty much couldn't have been worse it couldn't have been worse if they had tried to make it worse and by the way I mean the mainstream press\nAnd by bad I mean dishonest that's coming up to ... next\nShrugged was DOMA known a toy or for soda for

introduced on the program [noise] Leo votes near fresh from her debate with Tammy\nBaldwin one of the architects of the the progressive radicalism of of than the modern Democratic Party it's good to have your Leah\nWell hello Vicky happy to be here and a lot of your listeners\nRight so we yeah and I've just been talking about the clarity that we now have in America and I and I certainly\nThat we can remind Wisconsin that we have lived through this before and come on the other side\nBut the clarity that we have now that the Democrats have shown us exactly who they are and what they're about and what they're about is destroying the foundations of the republic everything from the concept of due process\nTo the constitution to the concept of sovereign borders and and I think this is something that um although it might be trying to get people to get at this election I think this is something\nThat ultimately is not going to bode well for the ... the progressive slash radicals and again it's important to point out Tammy Baldwin is a founding member of this contingent in both the U.S house of representatives and in the in the United States Senate\nShe isn't did and I hope they overplay their hand we've seen them do it here in Wisconsin I fact I even wrote a piece of out that\nThis is a very much the same game plan that they use in Wisconsin it backfired in Wisconsin I was out in D.C\nWhen the hearing was going on so I did a get a sense of what was happening and the surrounding area that honestly it's really reminded me of what we went through in Wisconsin and when I watch the hearing on TV I was not there\nI saw the outbursts and it was such a deja vu\nA I had a visceral reaction remembering what we went through and I do remember the backlash that came from that so\nI I Hope that that's what happens heavy boat when does represent that and I think that's the point I tried to make and the limited amounts of time that you have last night but Tammy Baldwin is part of the the\nThe party that is delay\nObstruct they'll lay obstruct go to court\nDo let Leah\nLet's call them this delay obstruct destroy because at the end it's not just delay obstructing then except if you lose its delay obstruct\nDestroy you saw the Democrats and Tammy Baldwin voted against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh based on a lie a lie about a phony accusation of sexual assault\nDelay obstruct destroy she was she is not a single time said hey you know I think we should have due process\nHere she was completely comfortable with the tactics embrace by the Democrats\nThe kind of tactics said that had people chasing you and other senators onto a button and trying to tip a bus over in Wisconsin because you dared\nTo actually support a piece of legislation to get our budget under control delay obstruct destroyed because at the end of the day the left would have destroyed each and every one of you guys in Wisconsin they would have destroyed your family's if they could\nThey didn't have the power that they have in Washington\nAnd Perry has very few than she did say last night that she believed in the due process so then I called her out on it due process\nYou couldn't even meet with judge Kavanaugh\nYou said forty eight hours that you were going to vote against him\nSo this is classic Tammy she says one thing in Wisconsin and does another thing when she is in DC\nWe've seen it on numerous issues there she talked to a good game about being a gun owner and and yet we know that she has voted a for a weapon bans so Tammy says one thing does another when she comes home she tries to pretend that she's myth moderate\nBut everyone needs to know how far out on the left hand me as\nWell yeah that's our job in the bed I taught at that time it takes is far more comfortable in the Hamptons weather friends than she is at a friday night fish fry in Wisconsin and she was recently in the Hamptons doing a fundraiser with\nThat's her her ... wouldn't care actually obliterate Medicare it obliterate the Medicare coverage of the seniors like so much of the blue ridge try here to blur it's my insurance policy which I like quite a grade but a great deal\nUm it gets rid of everything and I don't have a workaround solution I'm stuck with whatever the federal government the same federal government you know that can't figure out how not to have over a trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities and an ongoing deficit of a trillion dollars with Nineteen trillion dollars in debt\nThe same government who can't figure out how to solve that problem some of the things that's going to be able to manage the the decisions I make with my doctor and and how long should wait in line to get an appointment\nAnd the first place it's ... not to mention Leah it's it's about three trillion dollars a year and that's a that's a conservative cost estimate of what Tammy Baldwin's idea for health care would be\nWell and it's not [laughter] and tanks who has put those estimates out there the Urban Institute which is one that you were I usually go to for research also gave that same price tag on it and she she really couldn't even discussed that either and how it would be paid or\nUh yeah it was astounding to me that she needed so little and he looked at me encourages it with what I said that Medicare goes away she haven't read the bell
