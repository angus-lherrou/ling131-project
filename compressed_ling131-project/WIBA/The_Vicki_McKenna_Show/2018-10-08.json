Germany Goldman support for military support for ... since ...\nBusiness in New England or a that is what you're trying to sell us in Wisconsin which is absolutely contrary to her record so if you think the socialism crap is so great for you a\n... one one on it run ads about how you're anti business anti veteran I'm Wondering about how you're anti American energy and tell us about all those things but you will hear one or don't do it and you're at the core to pretend like you're an independent moderate you know pro business Wisconsin that whole you know both\nBut that's what they have to do in middle America\nUntil they can actually get to control that they that they desire Hillary Clinton and just posted an essay\nUm where she bemoan the electoral college Shon all the electoral college\nYou know this just means that those pleads in middle America still get a say and so while those pleads going to say let's shine them on and tell them that we are the exact opposite of what we are because we know that Wisconsin is not going to fully embrace socialism ally New York or California we know it\nWe know that there isn't a faculty lounge\nAnd tally up in northern Wisconsin but but you know what they count on is the press not said much about it and never doing I mean there's no critical coverage of Tammy Baldwin none whatsoever but what what sort of frustrating is that you can go to\nThe proper agrees with a loved one or gender matter of fact I was like a who's report for the people to let them decide because a lot when ... agrees with our gender they're willing to partner with her and put a dupe the voter and not call for her life isn't that sad to think we have a free press but they're not so free\nBecause they are willing to try to pull the wool over the voters are\nThey're not objective I mean there's still they still get to you know they still get to you know do whatever they want to do and they get to complain about dark money while essentially you know taking\n'em but they're not they're just simply not object and we don't have an objective press any longer at the same people would decry conservative media decry an alternative view of it\nUm here's what I I was ... when I was trying to get in here and why can't we lay a glove on Tammy Baldwin when she has got the most liberal voting record she's she had the most liberal voting record in the house she has one of the most liberal voting record is just a whole bunch of you know radicals are right there with her\nHow is it that it is so hard to just lay a glove on an incumbent even when the incumbent has voted against the interests of of almost everyone in the state except for the radical faculty lounge types of Madison\nYou know what it was an ... and I I Love ... and and I think people have you know to the Fox or to shot at winning this race\nBut it's incumbent upon Leah to actually tell Wisconsin who she is what you're going to do but also exposed Tammy Baldwin or who she has been and what she is um an expose the lie that term is running in her ads right now and you know wherever the\nUm and it's important that that that you'd be aggressive and call her out and and so a distinction between the two versions for America but it's not going to go watch a dark money\nYou know in the house races so in a in a in a whole cycle ... a house member in a tough seat might raise two million dollars right that for me so I was in my house is another one that's going to want to raise a cycle maybe two ... two million if a lot of money because what we're kind of read\nIn in congressional districts around America Democrat members of Congress wanting to unseat Republicans are raised in one point five to two million dollars in a quarter well\nHe lives in a quarter is their way you can in one corner dark money is flowing in these races George Soros one or you have Michael Bloomberg money eighty eighty million dollars on into races\nTo pick out Republicans I'm so you have all the special interest money and Democrats all the while go get special interest money out of election but they have no problem with special interest money what has mounted is going to try\nTo jam Republicans or a Democrat here's an\nHere's a great example of that there's something called the Wisconsin alliance of retired person doesn't that sound like a lovely innocuous crib just have a bunch of senior citizens but it's not\nThe friend group for the NFL CIO pouring money into this race for Tammy Baldwin to pretend that she has ever done anything for seniors this is a woman who who's who's claiming she wants to campaign on Medicare for all that's nationalized healthcare that would old Bullitt terrain\nMedicare coverage for senior citizens for seniors for how long is the Medicare program as you seniors know and love it would be gone if she gets her way this is a kind of radicalism we're talking about you know you don't see them report on the fact that she's against any and all tax cuts she's against any kind of energy independence\nShe's against oil and natural gas fracking this is somebody who thinks taxes need to go up on business and just pretty much everyone thinks that all businesses should be forced\nTo to let the government tell them what to pay their workers\nOr someone who is for the clean Power Plan which would have stripped forty thousand jobs in somewhere on ten billion dollars in investments in Wisconsin alone\nNever mind all of their cultural left isn't that she has supported I'm against banning part of the partial birth abortions against any and all kinds of gun protections you know this is somebody who is the radicals radical\nAnd all the good or policies that ... all the free\nGive away free the tree that uh when I ask her how you're going to pay for telling me oh she's a deer in headlights\nI don't know having to pay for it I'm going to make promises that I Can't really afford\nGrandmother a promise to the program is until you figure out how to pay for them later and what you would use there's plenty of money to pay for all the things I'm going to a I'm going to give you we do have an object of your pocket yet when it took your taxes\nIn the future to pay for all these promises and by the way it Vicki these policies never ever work when we talk about helping people out we want to give them a job you want to give them opportunities we want to give them a better salary\nThis collective is a Tammy Baldwin agenda\nNever ever work and again if it's fascinating that were in in in the space debating capitalism and socialism you know after

telling you that at all she was telling me this to Tony Tony can understand who he was and what was important to him it turned out that on the opioid crisis bread shovel was\nYears ahead of the rest of the country years ahead of the of the legislatures and others in understanding the importance of going after this problem at every possible way and and dealing with drugs and drug addictions in ways that made sense\nBut he never shied away from it he didn't ask us as a Republican issue a Democrat issue prosecutors issues of defense issue\nHe said it was a human issue and and so he led the way not just here people should understand he was a leader in the country\nOn opioid abuse legislation prosecutions and plan and\nAnd also drug treatment and drive the heart of that yes the Audi addicts side as well and the thing about ... is is that you you can you walk up tuned in to any of that and you ask him any questions so whenever you what what you're saying what do you care about it\nYou want to talk about the war on cops you went ahead with opioids you when it when you get an answer you get an answer he looks you in the eye and you get an honest answer you don't get an answer that's gone through a political calculation you get an answer that's honest and he does that on the campaign trail he does that with the real people in a real interactions\nAnd that is something that is an understanding of of how you you being attorney general and how you then run for attorney general ... take it take attempt the page from the template of the ... campaign\nAnd you can if as long as you're sincere as long as you're sincere and you're willing to answer questions honesty honestly and talk about the things you care about which is why you're running your going to do well and I think that's why I'm ... as as out performed a call ... we the in the\nRain and you know I sure hope so I mean it would be a real shame I mean there's plenty of Democrats out there that will support bread ... many many progressive will support him I\nThink about the people frankly that he had working in his opposite he's promoted into other positions that have gone on to be judges and the like and they weren't your typical conservative Republicans that's not what they did 'cause because in a prosecutor's job\nIn the job of the attorney for the state as attorney general you have to have a much bigger picture of of what counts and what doesn't you've got to get middle of the night you know they're flying off the Lincoln Hills are flying off to wherever that happens every weekend for the attorney general every weekend and he's got spectacular staff around him he's hired incredibly well\nAnd and we talked about some of that before\nI'm In the end it actually illustrates another point I wanted to make about the the other statewide candidate one of the things that I always ask people\nIf they were running for office if you have that private conversation with a person then you say to them\nWhat are you willing to lose a\nCan you and yet the honest answer in other words is there something that no matter what the winds of change or the wins political party would be\nYou would win or lose or and you'd be pleased to lose on it in other words on November the eight you could look back and you could say\nBut this issue was important I emphasize that I said if you want to vote on this vote for me and if they didn't that's okay and what's remarkable about that question is that\nPollsters no especially in statewide races how important it is\nYou can disagree on substantive issues\nWith the candidate but when they stand up for something and I mean really stand up I mean stand there and say slings and arrows do whatever you want but this is important to me then\nYou gain the respect of those that oppose you stand in the process many times their vote as well that's a that's a respect issue that that goes to the heart of the best political candidates and I asked that question what for a statewide candidate Leah Scott\nA brand would you lose everything over when we talk about the tree journal\nYou talk about the ... you talk about heroin addiction you talk about addiction and I'll tell you what branch and what would be pleased if that was the only issue in this campaign given his record given what he's done given how important it has been to him nationally and otherwise if I remember the ... that's all a campaign about about\nHe can smile and say it was worth it and there aren't many candidates out there that really have something that they feel that strongly about maybe Brad sort of disagree with me now and sing or something else but I in in my mind that that absolute dedication is defined how great it attorney general he's been\nHanging on one second we're going to do gym trip is tonight or we're going to take a break for commercials there will come back but um [noise]\nI just indoor so you just said about brat I think you're exactly right I think he's the I think he's a candidate has an answer the question what would you what would you be willing to lose the election\nI think it has an answer to that question I think water has an answer that question that they need they need to let people know that's right because that lets people know that you're not just there to be politician said let people know that you're there to actually get stuff done\nAnd I do think again I Do think similar has managed to have that translate into his campaign I Do I mean I just ...\nNot to mention if you ever meet the guy he's really
