S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they'd be clear point two percent\nOr you know less sorcerer quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away\nUm but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not gonna let them in nor can he because there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty ordination built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border official telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nOr that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer tone the examiner\nFamilies and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan Roy of dollar rail is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that a single adult males he goes on to say\nUh Mexico now is shut down a lot of their public transportation so the people in the caravan went up to walk which you know literally weeks away and they've also offered temporary work permits to the migrants to register for asylum\nWhich I think it was a very you know Mexico's been far tougher on illegal immigrants that we ever dreamed of big\nUm it's just sad that so many you know one of those things that America when the president talks about America First we've got to get every American out of poverty first reality ... every American their own opportunity by the way all this at

spending\nMoney one point two billion dollars how was one point two billion dollars per year too little\nI mean that's absurd that isn't it it's an enormous amount of money it is a huge increase in

an education aids how the budgets work\nThey somehow have been able to for a while get away with claiming we're cutting education and Wisconsin when there's one point two billion dollars more in it

[noise]\nLet's take a look at this um [noise]\nOne two punch that is going to be Nancy Pelosi and her teams\nIdea for what America should do economically\nTo things they want to do when I Do want to do a lot of things but two big things they want to do\nThe first big thing the Democrats want to do is if they can roll back the tax reform if they can't see if they can get the corporate tax rate up to twenty seven percent now that's just the federal corporate tax rate up to twenty seven percent\nYou figure state maybe has four percent maybe five percent in some cases you're talking about a substantial increase in taxes what does that do now simultaneously what the Democrats want to do they pull that music down before I slammed my head into a wall thank you very much\nWell the Democrats want to simultaneously do is take control one hundred percent of health care\nOne hundred percent so I've got our pal Merrill Matthews on the phone to talk about this one two punch let's roll back the tax reform let's make government spending far greater a percentage of GDP than it already is remember healthcare spending on its own is Eighteen percent of GDP\nAnd various tax competition among the states so it might be if if Wisconsin decides to raise it to Illinois don't break with him I moved to a Minnesota or am I come down here to Texas where a lot of companies have been coming just to be able to get lower tax rate\nYeah or Wisconsin we have now put ourselves in competition direct competition with a great state of Texas and I'm I'm you know what I say the competition makes us both grader um\nSo this is just that this is just warmed over tax and spend collective ism that we have seen you know pedaled in different ways it's just more blood\nAt this point it's almost like the you know they they kind of they they really really want to actually say the word socialist and and um maybe that's what we need to do is to finally get them to admit what they are all about and that is\nConvinced tore tax policy taking away people's ability to choose for themselves and and admit that they believe that equal misery everybody waiting in line and not\nGetting health care is far preferable than giving people access to quality health care if some people have slightly different levels of insurance than others\nAnd you know one of the things that happened is we've been such prosperous country for so long poor under educated millennials are coming out of public schools\nJust don't understand the fake socialism where everybody's treated well and and equal justice that's that's great and I don't think I don't think many of them are working for Facebook or Google or these other liberals out there who get\nTremendously good health insurance realize\nAll that goes away and you get your waiting lines or car just like everybody\nIt's not equal you know everybody's grade and everybody's equal and it's all wonderful it's ... it's everybody might be equal actually not the elites they're going to be fine um but they're equal in misery it's an equal level of mediocrity to misery so imagine\nYour quality of life right now\nWhat do you think Meryl slice it in half\nEconomically I Would say slice it in half and if you if you think that's the way everybody should be living including yourselves and by all means embrace socialism\nBut this is just madness that that we're dealing with I mean what was it four years ago you were talking about the exact same thing yeah\nAnd you know what four years from now are actually two years from now we'll be talking about the real Matthews is a different policy innovation thanks for coming on today\nThank you for having me have a happy\nCandy corn or no\nI got panic on here the I knew I like you for a reason ... it's

[noise]\nGives a blank I mean and as of November seventh will be a lame duck congressman I liked the man personally but\nI I\nDonald Trump brought up birthright citizenship\n[noise]\nBecause there's a question about whether or not the constitution authorizes birthright citizenship for illegal aliens\nAnd he wants Congress to get this question settled\nAnd other he's going to do it and he hasn't done it through executive order he's talking about it [noise] or Congress can take it up but I don't know why it happens it goes immediately to the courts to answer the question whether or not the idea of of the the concept of jurisdiction\nCovers illegal aliens\nIn America claiming their children ought to be granted citizenship because they got over the border\nBut it's been that even I have mine Paul\nRyan and Donald Trump disagreeing on the meaning of the fourteenth amendment as it relates to birthright citizenship who gives a damn\n\nHarry Reid back when Harry Reid was still trying to win elections and be rational\nSaid that it was insane to continue to allow illegal aliens to claim birthright citizenship now of\nCourse the saying oh yeah but I'm not I don't believe that any more well why well because immigrants are powerful\n... that makes no sense whatsoever [noise]\nNobody bothered to tease out whether or not anybody thinks it's a rational rational to allow illegal aliens no other country does this by the way to allow illegal\nAliens access to birthright citizenship also known as anger babies which allows them then access to welfare benefits in the United states\nThat have nothing to do with immigrants it has to do with illegal aliens immigrants we've we've we've let the media confuse us on this\nUm legal immigrants versus illegal aliens illegal immigrants versus illegal aliens these are two separate classes a papal\nIllegal aliens legal immigrants one is in the country legally they have gone through the process the applied for visas they have been granted visas\nThe other doesn't\nOne is a forwarded more religious than the United states than the other\nAnyway that headline was Trump denies\nUsing birthright citizenship for politics [noise]\nHe actually

efficient and less expensive and that's why we sconces been doing very very well and that can turn around and the wrong direction you have a governor race state legislative races\nUh this is important
