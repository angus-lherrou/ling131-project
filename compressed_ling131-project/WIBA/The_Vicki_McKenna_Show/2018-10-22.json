American invasion that is poised to um to hit to come up on the United states Mexico border soon uh probably doesn't bode well for messaging admitted terms the I think more interesting question is what do you do to stop it\nJ Christian Adams is on the phone with me from public interest legal foundation he's also\nUm been someone who is done enormous amounts of research on the question of the number of illegal aliens who are in the country the number of non citizens voters registered in the country he was on President Trump's election integrity taskforce and formerly of the Justice Department\nWhat do you do I mean this is what I'm thinking Christian ten thousand people they're not running they don't have guns there just slow walking across countries headed toward our is and what do you do to stop it how do you enforce the border\nWell the first step is to commit to doing that I'm not sure\nThat uh that a lot of people in Washington have an amendment to enforcing our border you know this was a test or the borders Mimi is it just the of mammals the wine or or does it mean something what else can you do\nI mean look you couldn't close a bridges the border bridges like in in ...\nBut there's places with international bridges but okay what's\nThe clothes they decided to turn up all the chain link fence\nThat comprises much with the U.S border or you know what you gotta you gotta forced order I mean what does that mean long we are means like your ... or\nUm you know who knows what they're thinking maybe those thinking about rubber ... so I mean you have to enforce the integrity of the nation or you don't have a nation\nHow is it that they're able to travel on encumbered through other countries now as I understand Mexico has been called into service of stopping this but they have been attacking Mexican police\nSo how how is it that other countries though of essentially allowed them free passage um throughout you know through their nation's without permission that seems to me that we've got a few ... we've got a few countries who are hell bent on making sure the southern border between Mexico in the United states is not secure\nWell don't forget the more aliens in the United states the more money that flows through Western Union turned out to places like Mexico El Salvador Nicaragua Honduras so countries like\nMexico have an incentive to allow uh uh up as many people off all of a porous border because it means more American dollars flowing into Mexico so there's a financial incentive\nRight on that issue is that a pressure point I'm using electric wire services to capture or or at least hold and sees the remittances because some of these countries we're talking one or two percent of their entire of their economy is there actually supported by money shipped back\nFrom people in the United states so is there a way to use that as a pressure point\nWell it might be more than one or two percent for all felt would or and I think yeah they they uh the Shirley\nCan use a banking regulations to to uh to to deal with this I Would imagine that this was something they've already thought about but it's you know the western union and all these water transfer services\nBy the way he's taken an exorbitant amount from the immigrants are ... they're the ones we're shifting all this money so\nWell yeah and they take an enormous amount from the immigrants shifting the money into their home countries so they have I mean one would assume would have um you know a vested interest in playing ball if the you know if if the hammer ultimately become shutting down the wire transfer services because that's how they're making their money\n[noise] it it ... and the right it\nIt's interesting to me I mean we have a federal law\nWe have the constitution that says um we can enforce our borders um you know we have a new treaty and new trade agreement with Mexico calling them into service to help us enforce our borders as well which from what I understand they have at least nominally attempting to do but in the end if people are willing to resisted\nAgreed but most people it's theoretically wouldn't but if if most people start seeing fake pictures of staged you know cages um by political action groups you know that like we saw CNN promote was a kid and a dog cage and make it sound like that was the United states detention facility or they\nCan they resist the natural tendency of the media to produce completely phony propaganda trying to support this idea that somehow we should just accept a foreign invasion and call it compassion\nThat's the problem I don't know\nChristian Adams thanks for coming on the show today [noise]\nI think we lost him um we need to take a break here folks [noise]\nYou know I got
