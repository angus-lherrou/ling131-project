involves a electrician electrical contracting company\nIn Wisconsin what was going to try to that with the ... the unions were trying to make a test case\nAnd we may actually have a significant victory that could inform cases around the country but explain what was going on with this electricians company that was hiring veterans and the unions were trying to essentially forced the guy I'm into unionizing without overtly saying so\nThis is the story of Scott ... of Colgate southeast Wisconsin veteran himself veteran of the Gulf War\nHires service this a bold veterans a quality electricians doing quality work and have done so for many many years in the southeastern Wisconsin in two thousand sixteen they were audited by the trust fund\nThat represents the trust fund of the international Brotherhood\nOf electrical workers be administrative piece of that trust what myths that happens all the time you get an audit they just wanna see basically and they have a right to do that to see what union employees are paying in terms of the pension funds and all of those kinds of benefits\nBut this union\nAnd the trust fund wanted to go further they wanted not just the payroll information they wanted the personal information and everybody everybody including Social Security numbers addresses all of it of non union employees as well let's\nExplain why this um electrical company run by a veteran hiring veteran hired both\nUnion and non union workers and there was no you must be a union member there was no you're not allowed to be a union member and for the union workers he was required to set aside a contribution into their pension find on ... so the trust fund\nHas some authority to audit his business the trust fund which is the union just so everybody understands this isn't separate from the Internet is the union decided that they were going to try to use the authority of the ... to get non union employees information\nFrom him had this succeeded Matt\nThis would've been the template\nAcross the country for small businesses medium businesses large businesses\nBecause we have claimed to audit whether or not you're making appropriate pension contributions we now accused you of lying about employees that are that you claim or non union but we're not sure\nIt's remarkable because we have now and we'll have you on the seventh circuit court of appeals remember this case was going through the federal court system in Milwaukee and the district court system now this case will go on to the appeals court because I should note that Scott slugger and veterans electric his company won\nA substantial portion of their lawsuit first and foremost that\nThe judge in the case said no you don't have a right you have to honor the contract the contract\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the union and the company specifically said you only have the right to audit and collect the information of the union employees not non union employees that's spelled out specifically on the contract\nSo for this district court judge it was a contractual matter but there's a bigger issue at stake one case already has been settled in the seventh circuit court of appeals in Chicago that was exactly like this and the argument was the u._s.\nWith a picture of a guy and an encouragement to go and shake down the scab\nI'm there's there are things we're still dealing with even after right to work has been passed in Wisconsin and unions themselves as well refusing to allow people to exit the union um creating rules that make it almost impossible to extract yourself this is what the Democrats by the way the Tony emerges\nA contingent wants to see returned back to Wisconsin a time when that group that that incredibly powerful and\nSluggish group of people controlled the budget process for Wisconsin\nYou know a lot at stake we're seeing that here which Scott\nWalker would remind people about this I really do 'cause I think
