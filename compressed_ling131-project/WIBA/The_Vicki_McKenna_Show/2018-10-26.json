voter id\nWhich is to say voter suppression through voter integrity [noise]\nConstitutional election law expert Hans von Spakovsky senior legal fellow in the heritage foundation's Edwin Meese the

narrative and he joins us now in the ... show good afternoon sir how are you\nHave at a great to talk to you again or how many days and counting before the upcoming election\nEleven days and counting eleven days can you believe in\nWell I Do because ah and I'm so tired of this right for every All right before every election\nThe last rolls out this absurd ridiculous and hockey pointed it made up some ... some years ago about voter suppression going on and the media all plays in and it it is it's just a fantasy creation of a left\nIt most certainly is we in Wisconsin knowing all too well obviously a we have a voter id law that is in place that's been in place now\nFinally for the last couple few election cycles but you as you well know this was a constant battle of the left doesn't win at the polls so they try to win and the the court system and the court of public opinion and they try to drive this narrative\nAnd and I I mean when I say when they accuse proponents of voter id\nAs those who are trying to suppress voters they are saying that these are people proponents of voter id who are trying to suppress a voter turnout with integrity oh you have to do\nHis show that you are who you are I don't know why that is such a big deal to the left\n[noise] well I don't know either but look it's gotten even worse um look the latest push on this is no longer just voter id um there was actually an op ed just a couple of weeks ago in the Washington Post\nThat meant that requiring people to register to vote is vote suppression yes yes\nYou know if you can believe that and you know those are the claims right like like right now being made down in Georgia against the the secretary of state because\nPassed a very common sense smart law that basically said [noise]\nAh when you registered to vote and you send in the form that you've failed out with your your name and your address and all that information\nI'm it needs to be substantially similar to other other information the state has like a driver's license or student ID et cetera and if there's a discrepancy\nThen your application to be registered will be considered pending while the state investigate and\nPeople are making this big deal about it we'll stay cut up and put it out that for example um nine thousand of the registrations in Georgia pending\nA because the people who registered are minors thing so vote or or like three thousand of the ones that are pending or because the person who registered used a fake address and yet the left has gone crazy over this they have actually filed a lawsuit\nTo prevent the state from actually checking the information on voter registration was I mean that's how nutty this is a God\nBut the polling on this is similar if I'm not mistaken to the polling on strong borders and on immigration reform I mean voter id is pretty popular most everywhere you go\nYeah it is and it really\nBoy it really tells you this cynical view that liberals seemed to have 'em about voters um\nAnd in fact they they seem to have a what I I I think you can't you can only characterize as a patronizing race racist views they they apparently think that their voters\nAre too stupid to deal with um a dead or find themselves when they go vote or they're too stupid to fill out a simple one page form\nThat asked for your name address and birth date in order to register to vote I mean how else can you explain it unless it's because\nThey really want to make it easy to to to cheat\nWell it it's similar to me in the left's portrayal and we're going to see this more and more but we certainly have seen it over the last couple of days the last four trail and the full narrative for many in the mainstream\nThat forget that this guy in Florida who's accused of sending pipe bombs through the mail\nOr has a long wrap sheet and a lot of Syria's appears anyway mental problems but they're going to try to pin this on Donald Trump were stirring up the hate pot they're going to try to pin this a pin and moved him this guy\nWho is alleged to have these horrible crimes they're going to move him into representing being the face of every conservative\nAnd their argument on that side is similar to what you're talking about here is that uh the poor Don conservatives in America cannot think for themselves they're being manipulated by the president it's the same kind of logic and it's the same sort of ivory tower\nYou know silly a thinking that goes on from the elite is left in this country when it comes to voter integrity\nYou know look you're absolutely right is this something I'd OJ only just notice as kind of interesting about this is um you know according to New York times this this guy's guy as you say as a light the criminal record and prior felony\nOf the Senate and house do you think that will be the hue and cry and moving forward\nYes I think um [noise]\nFor two reasons why they want an excuse for example if they lose an election they'll say up is because both towards the press even though it's not true and second\nThat they're using it as a fund raising mechanism to scare voters scare their constituency into thinking that there are all these evil a government officials Republicans out there trying to keep them out of the polls would you get it just simply not true\nAnd the thank you so much for your perspective your
