are here are some core concepts that have been under assault as of late we already know about the second amendment that one's been under assault for pretty much every by the Democrats\nBut the first amendment the Fourth Amendment the Fifth Amendment the sixth amendment\nThe fourteenth amendment I mean you've got a party that that sees the constitution as an impediment to its success it sees the constitution as an impediment to its power and it is now\nBroadly endorsing ideas like we need to get rid of the concept of due process we need to get rid of the concept of innocent until proven guilty we need to get rid of the concept of equal protection under the law to raise your hand Democrats if you'd like to obliterate the fourteenth amendment raise your hand\nNo hands on then what are you doing but we're not having a conversation in this country about how what the how fundamental the assaults have become and the pursuit of power um Wisconsin appeals\nCourt judge Brian ... is on the

the slippery slope argument she'd make my goodness that rhetoric seems to lead us to this place that seems to lead us to perhaps and obliteration of due process\nYou know I I I accepted that people would criticize\nMy conversation using a slippery slope argument I can ... you can't you can't say they don't want this anymore Brian\nBecause that's what they're saying due process only for certain people that's not due process um protection against unreasonable search and seizure only for certain people equal protection under the law only for certain people I Am scared\n[noise] well you know goes back to the point that you were making the constitution you know as as a minute it's it's not just a tool to be used for political ends and you know the job of judges and actually the job of every political branch whether the executive branch were the legislative branch is to\nHave to stay within the lines that had been prescribed and to protect their rights and I just actually speaking to a college class yesterday\nAnd ah one of the questions I asked them was what is the purpose of government according to our according to our founding fathers and the answer comes right from the declaration of independence which it actually quoted\nIn the Wisconsin Constitution as well but we we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal and I'm Down or their creator with certain unalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governments of government exist to protect\nOur natural and on on the ... inherent God given right\n[noise] did did they did their eyes glaze over because I don't I don't say that you know I don't actually say that facetiously is is is you might think because and I'm thinking back on my own education I'm a child of the eighties I went to grade school in the seventies and a high school in the eighties college in the eighties\nThere was never an ex solicit description of the purpose of government ever present it to me I'm now fifty years old\nAnd so my my concern is as simple as that is we just look at the words here the purpose of the government is to secure our rights rights from who not from government\nUs naturally these are a natural rights never won spry and was it ever explained to me in the entire time I ever went to school and that said to me that it's probably\nMissing from their education as well\nAbsolutely I one of the things I've I've done since I became a judge is like the game when I go to class and you can talk about\nThe constitution away structured and and all that as well and yeah it's amazing it's amazing and those are that is the whole foundation of our government that\nThat's the whole theory behind our constitution which obviously wasn't until later but that you protect those rights that's why you have the separation of powers that's why you have the substantive protection what freedom of speech and religion on the right to bear arms and\nOthers uh because uh baseball they saw their job is critical government that protects

hearing\nThe [noise]\nThe angry mob angry mob mob even though these were protect peaceful protest there were [noise]\nRepublicans are are running on this idea that the left as an angora you get the idea\nOkay you get the idea this is now CNN MSNBC NBC ABC CBS that's those are the folks you are hearing\nAll saying it's not a mob don't call it a mob oh don't that's Nick Sony and to call it a mob you can't call it a mob here's a definition of the word mob\nA large crowd of people especially one that is disorderly and intent on causing trouble\nOr violence or as a verb to crowd around someone in an unruly and excitable way in order to attack them\n[noise] so what we see but now you can't call mom to call it a my job\nMeans you're being Nick Sony and means you're being racial or racist that's now ... be hold\nRedefinition of mob do pass the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh I wanted to bring you won because it's not the first word that they've redefined to mean the opposite of what it actually is civility was also one is Hillary Clinton claim\nIn that in order to restore civility\nUm we have to kick out all the Republicans in silence them\nAnd then the non mom that behaves exactly like a mob um I guess will behave better but so you've got the I mean everything is on the sly when it comes to definitions meanings where does this come from\nWell first of all if if if the Marxist addict just true and it is they control history control the narrative\nThat it's even one step beyond that now they control the language that with a very language that we speak to each other they control behavior that look this is the same crowd Vicky is you know who when you had Tea Party groups I mean literally fifty and sixty year old people and straw hats and pan foods\nSitting around picnic blankets quietly protesting and then cleaning up after they left\nThose people were deemed mobs by the same people you just quoted\nWho are now saying that don't you dare referred to al ... who ... who stopped traffic in Portland, Oregon and to redirect it while Portland cop standing watch yelling and screaming racial epithets that people who don't follow the directions mobs scratching and pounding on the door the Supreme Court\nWhere Brett Kavanaugh as being confirmed ... call these now peaceful protest and I don't know who the one clown was who made the argument that according to the constitution\nYou get to protest anywhere you want any how do you want\nIt's been attached to it by groups like antifa\nThe risk of someone getting killed you've got to wonder if that's not a preferable end to them or to force a violent confrontation as something else I've considered between people who have the guns typically the conservatives Second Amendment fans\nAnd the ones who don't want in order to try to score some kind of you know some kind of rhetorical victory and and maybe they can marginally move the needle in their own direction\nI think you're right I think that the it's a with violence is a win win for the left right now at least they think so\nUh it they're not the least bit concerned about Republicans or conservatives getting beaten or shouted at or shot on playground there not bothered by that that they that that they know their media allies will downplayed those and not argue and argue that they weren't really democratic operative\nEvery time there's a shooting on the other hand it at school the first conclusion is it's always an IRA gun nut\nAnd so they know they've got the media to cover their back\nAnd so they're they think it's a win win violence against conservative will help to stifle conservatives will get the country used to ah that certain ideas and certain attitudes deserve punishment\nAnd if you like you said a conservative pulls out a gun when the ... are trying to redirect traffic and killed one of the ... one of the people who've tried to redirect traffic at that that that that looks like another white guy gunned down another anti protest or another white guy gunned down a black lives matter person and that the narrative that gets better than the funding their favorite too\nThough again I think that the big danger for me at all of this is not what's happening now the fact that people are taking this more and more seriously the fact that\nA cabin I only got fifty votes [noise] thirty eight senators voted against him\nIs a testament to how powerful these bogus ideas are with young kids\nUh this is the consequence of leaving Republicans of the consequences of leaving the school for the left\nAnd I are going to engage in this behavior and most people are going to vote next month aren't buying it however in Thirty years if nothing changes today's anti fat today's common a college kid protest today's handmade and draft protestor in Washington will be forty fifty year old\nAnd if their politics don't radically change or the majority of people at a few generations are going to be that shallow and\nFoolish and and that's what you have to watch here as at barbaric as their behavior is as an American is it is\nHuge scores of young people don't know anything better and they're the ones you've got to keep your hand again well most of them vote now which is why a Donald Trump is probably going to win again but what happens in Twenty years when all of these kids now who knows no other way\nHave the power
