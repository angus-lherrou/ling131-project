company Bruce company dot com\nOr\n\n\nWill come back we'll come back in the last to a head with a report from the front lines and the mob action\nLast night I just saw this headline this is a story about Donald Trump considering using his executive capacity to rein in birthright citizenship Trump target citizenship stokes pre election migrant fears\nNow I'm a whole bunch of people want Congress to do something about birthright citizenship and a whole bunch of people are worried about a massive swell on the end of an invasion force marching across Mexico\nWith the intent of crashing the gates of the United states\nAnd last I checked Donald Trump didn't create the caravan Ira Mehlman federation for American immigration reforms on the phone with me um boy the the the political rhetoric surrounding all of this is is kind of at at you know at eleven at this point\nYou know political rhetoric that eleven about just about everything these days ... problem\nBut uh yeah I mean ... all the president is doing here is providing a vehicle to get this issue result once and for all\nWe've known for years that you have people coming to the United states with the express purpose of giving birth in this country so that they can have a what the other side of objects to his anchor babies are but that is they're clear intent\nRather than dealing with symptoms we need to be dealing with the\nThe causes of this and we're not doing it\n[noise] so even on remittances and that would probably just run afoul of of the law I'm e verify is there a way to make this finally something we can count on\n... ... you know I think I personally think what we ought to be doing is prosecuting people who are the ones are in the United states doing the hiring here either through massive\nFines or or something else but he verify seems to make sense\nIt does and should have been done a long time a long time and techno no technological barrier it's the same technology that we use to verify credit cards and ATM cards there's absolutely no reason other than the lack of political will but we haven't done it\nYeah exactly um and there are companies that do it voluntarily you know they all they did it in place you can it's not like the system needs to be built from scratch we're not talking about the Obamacare portal website it's already there with plenty of companies willingly embracing it voluntarily\n'em and making this system mandatory seems to make a lot of sense as well um but it's never one thing it's not one thing right it's you've got to do a whole bunch of things pass a bill to build the wall\nPass a bill to rein in birthright citizenship yes it will go before the court so why get it before the courts we need to know once and for all\nUm you know a find a way to tax the ever loving ... out of remittances raining foreign aid you know maybe even find a way to demand remittances back from countries from monies that are sent over there um you know for a dollar for dollar reduction in foreign aid perhaps is something we consider as well\nUm you know I I don't know there's there's gotta be something maybe even to do you know in in the next time you revisit some trade agreements but\nBut right now doing nothing is is basically saying the United states is not a country anymore\nRight and and that's what Congress is good at doing nothing so are we are\nSo I I think this though this is an issue remember I don't know how long you and I've been talking on here ten years where we've always said that Americans actually really do care about this while the while the politicians were pretending nobody cared and it was in a dead letter issue essentially but it's not this is taking a lot of people off\nAnd end while immigration is actually not high on the list of your average Democrat it is high on the list of your average moderate Republicans so I'm not sure they're not shooting themselves in the foot with this one [noise]\nUm they you know this is an issue that obviously you know it was big issue in the last election is going to be a big issue in this election it's not going away and it's not going to go away until we deal with this forthrightly instead of just kind of you know sweeping\nIt under the rug and they can it's not a problem now we've got to do it they were coming\nThanks Ira thanks for coming on the program today pleasure thanks great to

made the board chose to a juror\nTo beat the deadline and there'll be no public comments at all allowed because they don't have to because these people shut it down why because they do not have the courage of their convictions I Am told that police will be at the next meeting I Am told that by a those loose department\nAt the next to me which is what they want they want but it's because the\nBut they're doing it now anyway they're going to cry police or pressured they're here to a process that's the name of saying it anyway so they might as well have a reason for it like my father said I'll give you a reason to cry this\nIs the group that has been for the past Eighteen months showing up and harassing the school board to get Madison the arrows out of the schools are they want the Madison arrows thrown out of the schools\nThey want they now go look at the video because you've posted the video but David Alaska dot com go look at the video\nThat people who want to create a swarm a menace swarm at a public meeting to not phones out of people's hands and scare the crap out of people\nThey want to be the ones calling the shots and security in schools yeah they want to be the ones calling the shots mind you they don't care that kids from a file it are getting on buses well as guns they don't care that there are many lays in terms of there's chaos in the in the hallways\nThey want to be the ones in control of security which means\nChaos rains biggest chaos is their preferred state of being all\nWell and it's a it's a three or four hundred and Fifteen million dollar budget out of which are the costs costs three hundred and sixty six thousand they one of the things that I didn't report on but the suggestion of courses that\nThe school board school district give them the money\nYou know what I Would suggest that anybody who can get your kids out of the Madison schools if they are going to actually shot they throw the arrows out that ought to be your sign\nLet me tell you about exercise open enrollment I met a parent\nOr who was wearing his el kept for ... or his daughters and Senate middle school which is on the campus of ... and she is due to go to the next year after their meeting he approached me and said\nI'm going to talk to my to my ex wife and we're going to move our daughter out of Madison I Do not want to going to that school [noise]\nAnd he sent me a little email and after it and this was his baptism by fire because this was just for a school board and me and one of the cause he said I don't think anyone is not a sound physical stature or backup should go and speak in light of what I witnessed last night\nMy wife has a little bit of a osteoporosis she was swarmed at the last minute she went to she wouldn't go with me last night I said I don't blame you I don't think you should go and that's what if there was no one there to protect\nThe safety of people in that room will get to that in a second this guy that you talked to who we will not name\nBecause he's afraid he's afraid that some ... that he will be targeted and I don't blame them for being afraid because people were chased out of the last meeting the one that the young man that chase all the way to an alternate Frisbee game and fish bird but it's this\nHe was sitting in never spoke was sitting in a seat\nDid not stand up to not wait his hands to not block anybody's view when he was doing was filming what was going on with his cell phone camera and for that\n... he was he had a woman come up and knock the camera out of his hand he was men is just sit there and say nothing right nothing was selling what was going on\n... ... they honestly this is fascism writ large on the ... and the Madison school board and the Madison school board acquiesce has acquiesced every time\nI mentioned the woman was her son being chased all the way to Pittsburgh she has moved out of the district and she asked me not to give her name ever again because she says I'm just trying to get my kids through school and I want to lie low [noise]\nThis is what why and she calls or this on on your show Vicki a that these are these are well orchestrated effort to harass and intimidate and that's what it is doing\nAnd it is being rubber stamped by the school board so there were security\nAt the at the board meeting ... okay air quote security and I notice that there's video and I mean I actually that that the Wisconsin state journal article on this was pretty good um it has a video of you\nTelling a security person who told you right to go away that that was it was their responsibility to protect you\nKnow I in a way I understand it once appointed to even being there you know the and that's the thing or they take the course of least resistance in a way I understand that technically not specifically a if we can get this one guy said don't I don't have to make these five or six people sit down\nBut I barking her face and I had to it because it was so loud I said no I Am standing here I Am exercising my rights I Will not move you protect my right\nAnd if you can't if they can then get them out of the building and get the Madison police\nIs Orwell gr anything\nThere was a fellow by the way this guy from the follow it I only he only pushed me after the meeting I didn't even see him a video or using his smartphone\nWhere there was a a fellow uh who was there and I saw here of cell phone I was trying to you know do my recording I leaned over to him and I said call nine one one which he did and you and you could see him talking to them and holding the phone up so they could hear the ... and the police did come just as there were closing off the main thing\nUh [noise] and I did see a police officials today who told me we will be at the next meeting\nThey have to be at the next meeting at the same time\nThat's exactly what the mob once the ... on the train optics they traded or is this is yes this is direct action this has disrupted ... this is ... render chaos\nAnd they're going to show that the police are are dragging people of color plus you know and and half of them are white as opposed to wonder bread but that's\nLike one of the women who are trying to block the guy was about as wide as you and I are um but here here's the thing this is this is one of the school board says\nI'm OK we're going to ... we're not temporarily at during the meeting until we Claire this room that's right and that is what the Dane County board should have done one of the same when a similar group of people in fact many of the same participant\nRibbon diagram all show a lot of overlap\nExactly exactly we tried to derail the jail it is you know the the massive government is required to\nProtect the rights of people to address the Madison government right sent me at the city council or the school board or the county board though it is not you you cannot just simply say okay we're going to adjourn and then we'll go we'll go we'll we'll go somewhere else where nobody can participate in the political process will pass a budget\nAnd in the meantime we've allowed how many people were there twenty forty\nAll of these people there's I've never seen so many they had they uh they had eighty there they had I could see them or some of the organizers giving them instructions on what they had the most I've ever seen eighty plus there were a good number of other people who are like the ... or like the parents said a call the cops\nUm [noise]\nAs far as I Know you know those two shooting incidents one in the neighborhood of ... one in the school bus there by the way they want a free bus passes already thought they had that but it didn't use the bus you got to get on with the with the guys with with the shooting the guns I don't know if that's going to work\nWho who guys who got injured or three kids of color\nIn those incidents just those three are so I don't know that the police in Madison are wrapping up a a kids of color or I think that if you want to\nBring race into it I don't I look at conduct if I had my druthers it would be against the law you lose your federal funding if you if you aggregate it any data\nBy race I don't want by race I Want to buy buy accomplish my activity by crime by or whatever but to say that but that this\nSchool board is is determined to make the numbers work to the point where they said well we can't get the arrows of the schools because of all was darn headlines so they put so many handcuffs on them\nI mean the limit locker searches only when probable cause every crime or imminent threat or danger probable cause is the legal term meaning you got to go to a judge I either prove probable cause before it can look in the kids' lack of ...\nAnd you have to have problems caused by the term so basically now my locker searches I mean the kids can stop their lockers would do or weapons it's all good no worries because because the police now are going to be prohibited from searching lockers\nAnd then you have a committee of of people including with an emphasis on representing you tour of the most cited most suspended or expelled\nTo sit in judgment of the arrows\nSo wait a minute let me let me ... let let that wash up you know for a second okay the ... the idea is to have the delinquent cat yeah sit in judgment\nOf the police yeah to juvenile delinquents are going to sit in judgment of the police in\nIn in one one member of the previous meaning is ... is a recipe for education right there are environmental words asylum an enemy it's come to mind\nUm [noise] but this is how\nAgain I say poll asked by ... it's like we don't trust these guys and they have to uh\nNotify administrators to ensure that presidents of officers respond will be less likely to escalated potentially volatile situation\nAnd we had to take a break here I'm Still reeling over the idea that the appropriate security has already are the delinquent kids not the police officer is that the threat is is the police officer and not the delinquents hang on one second\nFor more information about this we go to W.
