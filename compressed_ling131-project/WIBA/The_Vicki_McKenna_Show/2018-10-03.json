now in America because it would only happen around the left positions so we need\nSplit beers because it's in order to the best we're going to get to we have a bipartisan positions throughout under John Doe the newspapers editorializing against us in against the reforms and losing and losing I was last night that event with Senator Mark Kline from my son a district who was in the assembly at that time\nAnd there's some women Brooks in ... was there and they were recounting some of this but that legislative session\nTwo thousand Lebanon twelve here was the best in the country and my memory best in the country tremendous session and follow on results are amazing in Wisconsin we have an economic boom of these raids these disgusting raids on family homes for planned\nIn Madison and accomplish from the government accountability board which shouldn't even have criminal investigative authority I'm scheming about the roads to be taken and whose homes to hit\nCooked up by staff of the government accountability board that agency is gone\nBecause why because it's ... it's gone because of you and and then finally some some courageous even the legislature took on the side um but\nThey lost that's why they came after you why did the government accountability board and John Chisholm in and ... and the other da's come after Eric O'Keefe and club for growth and Wisconsin right to life and WAMC and I mean there's a lot of groups that that got swept up into this new one\nYeah I'll get I'll give you a quick timeline\nMother his mother is happening because Trump won ... because there was a crime to be investigated but because the left can't abide losing they don't have a way to actually govern\nThe John does we're both an attempt to overturn the election and the policies of Scott Walker Muller investigations and attempt to overturn the election of Donald Trump\nThat that is correct um but ... the first substantial political engagement and it was constant club for growth was formed in two thousand four and that's the identity through which I became involved we were just one of the players involved and information about the activities and was conscious spending typically a million bucks a cycle\nJust another player until the two thousand a Supreme Court race when a loophole Louis was up for reelection and we had a big fight and he had voted in a four three majority to overturn\nSo an array of legislative reforms blocking the will of the people that was coming through the legislature and the governor's son so I got involved with national people in and say people and it was a narrow race and uh we're in baseball sued and\nThat was the first sitting justice to lose here since the court that approved the Milwaukee Braves move to Atlanta literally so that way then we come up and we have Walker come any does the reforms and they throw everything out and they try to flip the Senate\nJune ... a fifth two thousand twelve they fail in the water recall a sequence of losses they were in court trying to block the John Doe with local judges there in federal court steak or lose lose the ... act tennis upheld Walker\nSurvives and and the two thousand well election on the coattails of Obama's reelection and him getting the electoral votes here when the Republicans pickup Senate seats don't lose any assembly states\nThey look at that they can win elections two months after the June recall August two thousand twelve John Chisholm launches there's John Doe that's why they gave up on winning Neal\nAnd I can't I Can't stand the parallels with Mahler and Trump\nThat the left has dragged every single thing Trump has done into a into a court if they if they lose in one court they go into another court with the exact same claimed be at the travel ban or whatever else it is that Mahler investigation is the John Doe Wisconsin was a testing ground\nIt was a strategic tactical testing ground for the for the new laughed strategy going forward and now you now you see what you Liz\nBlown up on the big screen nationally now\nI mean when senators in the United States Senate are needing police escorts to their offices that sounds familiar doesn't it era we had state senators needing police escorts to their offices mobs of people\nShouting down shutting down democracy calling at democracy exactly what happened in Wisconsin a bureaucratic investigation with no limits and no guidance solely at the whims of the bureaucrats government accountability board and Wisconsin\nAnd it's the department of justice without any kind of meaningful leadership and the United states\nTrump won he wasn't supposed to win and Walker won he wasn't supposed to win and anybody who supported either one of them punished so that they'd never make the same mistake twice\nAnd I said on your show a few years ago I'll say again today on the anniversary um my colleagues homes are rated because of their virtue and by that I mean because of their skill and engaging and the political debate was success that's why they were attacked\nThat's why and I'm I'm that's and Kavanaugh is being attacked\nWith made up charges because he is an excellent judge with a great record\nSo they don't want to talk issue so they make stuff up it's a it's it's a it's a it's at the same time a a a scary time in a fascinating time and uh one of my lawyers who you he's been on the show at a grime this morning I send them an anniversary thank you and he said this was at the same time\nAnd then all has a legal career now that he's not too old but he's getting close to Twenty years and he said this is the most disturbing and the most rewarding case who's ever worked on\nAnd I'm I'm I'm I'm grateful for how it turned out in the political narrative arena\nUm with your help and kill and the wall Street Journal we flipped we we had a narrative counter narrative that prevailed in the political arena I'm frustrated by the lack of consequences for any of the mail or factors and for the fact that writes trampling John Chisholm remains in offices district attorney\nAnd um I don't trust any of his convictions that he ever gets David bodies is chief investigator is a bully who's a professional bully he likes going on home right and abusing women and to end a challenging children as their parents why they're in the house\nTearing families apart shaming people scaring them is who's paying job and he reports directly to John chosen um so it's frustrating to him still in power here's what else\nIs frustrating it's frustrating that the Republicans elected Republicans have power not all of them um you know you see significantly we had people like like Senator David Craig who was senator leave look me or they were all excellent um but\nThe for the most part people who are in positions of power like the positions of power as Republicans\nThey want to move on they don't want to they don't they just say just like even even defending act ten which blows my mind get out there and defend our town it's a wonderful reform it's the reason why we went through all of this stuff and it's been paying dividends ever since\nUm go out there and talk about it but it's almost like Republicans do something they can be they can be worked into doing something reform minded and controversial and right\nRight and the policy writes on liberty and and it's a fight\nAnd then they they we we were in the fight and then they think oh I don't want to talk about that anymore\nSo John Doe we will fight for the most part well let's not talk about it any more um\nYou know I mean good grief this is when the last little run out the school or on their on their madness and we need to start running up the score and taking credit and patting ourselves on the back on the great strides we have made just in the last few eat for a few years for liberty\nYeah but I Know one of my mentors or\nWhen we were patting ourselves on the back from one of the John Doe victories said\nOur side business like sports you when you have a trophy you go home you take a couple of months he said the left doesn't ... they're going to get up today are that are going to come after you get so it's ... they're really unless we have to be a relentless\nAnd by the way though in terms of how how I Would address reforms going forward in Wisconsin the civil liberties stuff\nI wouldn't make it about John Doe they're prosecutors can't be trusted with all the power they have and they intimidate legislators they have ... power needs to be rolled back that's a national problem\nUm and uh uh I think ... look politicians are rationally afraid of prosecutors because they can go they have huge discretion so the news we need legislative reforms are particularly targeting and they were writing any per se\nWe need a here's one and this is a I think this could be a a this could be a Ninety percent or as a friend of mine likes to say\nUm there was a decision and this was in the ... case on on something that you and I both thought was an easy slam dunk on the Fourth Amendment that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated how we shore up some of the some of the liberties that have been that had been you know\nSoftened over time just to just say you know we're not going to allow a prosecutor\nTo claim that that in looking for an email that gives him permission to basically download your entire digital life and go fishing for something just because he's\nHappened to be looking for something else that's that's something that we should be able to get a whole bunch of people who agree\nRight in other words ... was conscious perfectly free to have a stronger protections than the bill of rights you bet and we should ... and you could look at that and some of the material they argue for it and uh the Kelly Ryan pushed a petition for Sirte before the Supreme Court we add liberal professors conservative professors\nThey make
