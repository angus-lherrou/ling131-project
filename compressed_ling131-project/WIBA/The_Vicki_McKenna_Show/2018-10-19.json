Jim ... [laughter] but I Am vision or father widow is our duty there are yeah we do um\nAnyway so that this is all it all began a and we I I'm completely shocked that it's legal in Wisconsin but it is I'm completely shocked\nIsn't it amazing because of the regulatory battles that if you recall that you went through over the last year and a half to get a marriage life just to get a marriage license and this was cool I'm Glad for I don't want to see someone\nWrote down the road blocks on but yeah just I mean the the ridiculous ness of you know the marriage license process I ... and then and then not getting it I mean actually having some people who are who are\nWho who recognize the absurdity of the hoops you have to jump to to get a marriage license in Wisconsin and\nAnd and actually offering pieces of legislation and and having\nI don't know if it's protectionism mad I don't know if it's if it's just the busy body nature of people in government but having none of those pieces of legislation even be advance to the floor I'm One of the pieces of legislation I recall was\nA ... in Wisconsin you have to wait six months until you are officially divorced before you can get married again and oh well we want to protect the institution of marriage now because you can get divorced like that\nMaybe divorce in Wisconsin's not not hard I mean it's hard on the couples it's hard if you have to you know lose half your savings\nUm or your house in Cornell something like that we legally speaking legally speaking it's not difficult it is a mentally difficult to get a divorce I'm ... and it take but you know finally if you're if you're if a contentious or it can tend to divorce it can take a year you know if if you're fighting over things in court\nThen wait another six months so the average length of time because most divorces are not amicable mostly divorces or something that's you know in dispute\nA despite the fact that the legal process itself is a simple process you have another six months tacked onto it\nAnd so I it was Cindy do ... representative do ... had introduced a piece of legislation and uh and said this is\nYou know sort of ridiculous and you know what ... ... we don't have a lower divorce rate than than states that don't have this waiting rule in place and and I'm actually listening to it was ... from Wisconsin Family Research\nWho was ... you know talking about the importance\nOf marriage and the harm that's done to children and divorced and I thought that have nothing to do with this issue to the people who made it easy to get divorced in Wisconsin you're\nI mean she was he was speaking to the exact wrong thing that we weren't even talking\nAbout and and then of course the conservatives on the committee just decided they didn't want to say I want to block the dress well\nAnd it was it was absolute ... ... ... and there was one of the many many different things that we're all pain in the ass just to get a marriage license which could have been different and you had to file you had to apply for one place you had to file in a different place you had a ... a short amount of time or you could have risen jail time but you\nKnow and this was but I don't understand from the conservatives on this committee we value the institution of marriage right if that's the case then why do we put road we always I\nI heard this too well we don't want people to go into marriage you know without thinking because because the government is really going to be the arbiter of whether or not people think they're ready to get married and they're saying oh boy all these hoops honey maybe we shouldn't get married we have to make sure I give me a break\nIt ... the things that I was listening to it we're just you know is enough to just aggravating they took it I remember taking a day\nOff to go testify this hearing anyway ... good to have you on the program I Am now going to be part of the process of trying to streamline streamline\nThe uh the ... of a couple and send them off\nOn their merry way to start filing the paperwork [laughter] real pain in the neck after the ceremony after planning your reception and all that stuff is the paperwork so that's how I had ... blue slug more regulation\nOh no kidding we ran out of the wire though filing our lifestyle I remember we were we were I think two hours away from being at risk of jail times reserves that it was within our yeah but you were dealing with it because we were we looked at the thing and we said oh my gosh\nI think I called you and said Matt I ...

could make the point about powerful remote would have would have liked it All right now that's all we have in the program I here's why here's why here's why Kenny Baldwin has proposed obliterated\nMedicare Medicaid she doesn't think she's doing this or maybe she's just lying a try care and private insurance that is what her bill does sections won all five to one o seven that's what her build does\nIt gets rid of Medicare Medicaid try care Medicare Advantage as well and private insurance K gets rid of it\nAnd somehow even though private insurance ... those other socialize programs that I just listened Medicare Medicaid and veterans care by the way I'm not saying anything bad about veterans care as far as I'm concerned if taxpayers foot and one hundred percent of\nOf your health care quality healthcare best quality healthcare I'd be okay with it but it's still a socialized program that needs to be propped up by taxpayer support\nHow does that program get propped up right now the private sector in in in the in terms of the hospitals being able to control costs and doctors being able to be fairly compensated Medicare Medicaid et cetera\nPrivate sector insurance covers the costs not covered by the government's reimbursement and regret\nOut a level of forty fifty six six thirty and\nYeah at the max in Medicaid it's about sixty cents on the dollar you're in Wisconsin in Medicare which is a senior citizens care I'm your starting because more and more seniors are hitting the system you are starting to see the compensation for doctors and clinics be reduced to getting closer to Medicaid\nLevels now seniors something you have to understand I'm not I'm not advocating taking away your Medicare that\nTammy Baldwin's advocating um people say I paid into the system you did but you only paid about a third of the cost of the care you're taking out so that\nOther two thirds has to be propped up by somebody who's going to prop that up private sector\nInsurance is going to ... and we get rid of it So Matt kill your\nOrganization has calculated the cost to Wisconsin if in fact Tammy Baldwin is successful in Bolivia rating\nThe propping up of socialized health care by private sector insurance as it is now what's it going to cost Wisconsin taxpayers Wisconsin taxpayers if Tammy Baldwin is successful\nWell if we did a Tammy Baldwin like Bernie Sanders white clam and made it a Medicaid for all\nOf a single payer healthcare system and ... and advocates for that as do a number of Democrats in the state would cost the taxpayer an additional thirty billion dollars in two thousand nine PM alone one year one year\nThirty billion for adjust our state in one year\nIf you look over time and this is not a single year commitment as we will know this would have to be forever ice shelf forever but just look at the next decade ahead you'll get cost increases you look up the cost of government you look at the cost of not bringing\nCompetition into the marketplace single payer one single payer system you're looking at about four hundred billion dollars this in one year alone would nearly doubled the size of the ...
