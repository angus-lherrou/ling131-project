abandon\nFreely elected governments which they consider to be Burr's wa I mean they they honestly believe the concept of elections to be you know somehow um offensive they attack a group of peaceful protesters\nAnd the police stand by in fact there was a man who was driving through in a in a car just to sit down and old man who gets attacked\nBecause he makes a mistake of getting stuck in the area where this mob is please do nothing to him please do not think people will eventually do something either they'll they'll stop protesting that little shop showing up\nIn public events or they'll do something to protect themselves and that of course is what the mobs waiting for because they want to say see now they're coming after us now they're being violent\nAnd still don't vote that look I'm into for everybody knows but no\nOther people that they are not a anti fascist the body issues in there to tell them to read it gets when\nThey show up at one object confrontational physical confrontation and they have been catalyst will if there's no other song\nOr at the end of the other side and these are really turns on the police and they start to attract the police so this is dealing with here but just go round shirts\nAnd the Democrats pardon you wouldn't have to fight for\nThe Democratic party and that's why you know prominent Democrat and you've heard no other Democrats than to go and come down the actions of this mom vicious vicious\nWill tell the cherry even very center of the week and I heard was was really impressed on one of the TV shows that he would not condemn the actions of anthem\nI don't know if it's out of fear or if it's because the the the the the Democratic party steel workers crossroads here that we don't resort the fear and intimidation of political violence but this thing may come caving in on this thing being\nAh the success that President Trump is traveling the pushback finally won the uh from the white or not so much conservatives or as wars pushback from the uh the RMC in that you really look at the cabinet nominations and confirmation as an example why don't we need to build back home\nSo they're very threatened courts is you know\nUnder fire wall and they see that slipping away and so they're white ... to\n... and and do some on traditional tactics if you will in the political environment and on you know showing the music to this is about the dialogue anymore that the ... democratic concern aren't going to be charged with returning now\nTo like the KKK and I'm fifty very timid Asian right a mob of checks and that sort of thing\nAnd and I'm just glad whining on your program\nAnd other places are talking about this last year this this group was no\nGood if people were evil and of course the leftist media so that was over the top and\nIt was hard for you don't know I Know what I'm Talking about I don't do this for a for shock value study though soul into law enforcement decide that they're going to have to start using worst movies people show up\nYou know they're showing up with the invention of looking for confrontation they showed up in Portland about a month ago there was another um a rally but it's a patriot prayer\nAnd emphysema showed up\nWith weapons with sticks and bottle and and and another one night that the police were going off these people at that point we should have dispersed and when you don't care to the rally you don't care to live with the people who have done it the right way to bring cheap for by the way out a permit\nYou to spurs and the flood use all reasonable forced to do so\nYou know the the reason a leftist media isn't going to condemn this or is going to call you all for being extreme it's all they know how to do their part of the transactional politics of this whole thing where they just simply look down shovel shovel their feet a little bit\nAnd because they they they racking it helps their side there aside their political side being the liberal political side that's why Mazie Hirono won't contaminated by Maxine Waters won't condemn it that's why no media is ever going to stick a microphone and Tammy Baldwin space and ask her to condemn it\nYou won't see it because the media is is there at the same point where the radicals are where they were just like what else are we going to do to stop Trump what else are we going to do to stop the Republicans and so they they have made a transaction with with the mob\nHoping that if they don't report on the reality of it\nOr they pretended isn't what it is that somehow the mob will leave them alone and at the end of the day the media gets eaten too because there's no buddy is radical enough for antifa\nThey want anarchy they want a complete up ending of the system they want to impose their own violent vision of power on America\nAnd the Democrats thinking they can keep this rabbit dog on a leash that's delusional and the media thinking they can keep a dog on a leash is delusional\nWell you know the leaders of the Democratic party they can do this or do you think back to the wall street days with the this is an offshoot of at\nA group that was involved in it and you know the thing with with anti for though they are in in our group I'm Glad that we're starting to use the right to everyone would call ... that's what they are and it's gotten to the gym and Democrat what the Democrats to go to church in the corner that\nIs worse than what groups rose up to rally as legitimate rally\nAn answer bushels a start but they'll start clips and so on who to choke somebody on the side of the good guys responding to know all the way back with us also spent Democrats do not go down there so\nA more effective a loan Conan measures are needed I don't tell people what to do I'm not going to say than we do this that and the other gothic bumped into him type or wherever here's another thing I'd like to add up and ... with a\nViolation of civil rights got started Europe the right\nOr the first and members to show up and rallied\nUm you know to your calls to participate in the political process when you show up with a ... really do the right to do that without fear and intimidation and when
