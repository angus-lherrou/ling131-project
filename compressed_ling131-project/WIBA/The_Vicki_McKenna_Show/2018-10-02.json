I mean the parallels in terms of the thought process I think are\nAre quite striking in Wisconsin in Wisconsin the John Doe wasn't because anybody thought there was a campaign finance violation because you you unless you can't read you can read the campaign finance statutes\nIt was about Scott Walker becoming governor it was about the court's not declaring at ten said it was about Scott Walker winning the recall election it was about the Democrats' best laid plans and heart felt hatred\nOf everything Walker and act ten related feeling\nThat's what it was about ... and ... because the last you give them credit for one thing they never quit they never say die there are no ethics that you can point to where standards you can point to you can't even point to the law itself as we learned in Wisconsin\nAnd and and and find a way to shame them into actually admitting they were wrong that's what we've got going on Brett Kavanaugh was not a serial sex offender he's not a drunk\nHe's one of these things and it doesn't matter because he is in the way of what they need and that is someone on the Supreme Court that can a rubber stamp the things that ... that the voters of America won't give him\nIt really was a similarity here isn't there I Want to get too much to offer the risk of offending perpetually aggrieved but Wisconsin and it's John Doe investigation and everything surrounding cooked up by the left was all about power as you said it was the fact that in two thousand and Governor Scott\nWalker a Republican won an election duly won that election and Republicans took over legislative power\nThe Democrats did not want that of course Republicans wouldn't want\nDemocrats in power but they would have accepted the results Democrats did not in Wisconsin but he did not in two thousand six steam when a Republican particularly or certain republic hum came into power\nAnd when ... when we sustained when Republican sustained power conservative sustained power\nIn Congress as well so therein lies the connection and the cabin okay All right we're talking about sexual assault and sexual assault isn't about sex\nIt's about power why they view it that way it's about control\nPolitics and in particular what's happening in the swamp isn't about justice bringing justice to victims or alleged victims of sexual assault gifts about power and control\nOh you already saw how much it was about power Dianne Feinstein was just worried about a little bitty change in her armor at having released the name her staff releasing the name of Christine\nFord and who to blame Christine I mean that's all you needed to know but but this is true and the the thing that the the parallels um\nHave to do with two Republicans to specific kinds of Republicans here and that's Trump and Walker and they don't have personality overlaps there's nothing similar about the guys in the way they handle you know interactions with people or anything like that\nUm they have vastly different lives\nBut the but the thing that I think Walker wouldn't have endured a John Doe investigation had Walker not done what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail and I don't think Trump would be in during this madness\nHad he not actually be gone to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail not the least of which is a successful renegotiation of NAFTA which nobody thought could happen\nBut it had either one of these guys just spent all talk no action Republicans like the Democrats have been used to\nThan it is unlikely that you would be seeing\nAny of this because the Trump would have probably nominated some bland moderate that the left could have counted on being a lock for roe v Wade Walker wouldn't have introduced at ten wouldn't have introduced the tort reform and the regulatory reform Trump wouldn't have deregulated he wouldn't have done\nThese things had they simply been the same old same old all talk no action Republicans then we'd probably just be blissfully ignorant of just how how visceral and ugly and in dank and nasty and toxic in cancers the swamp has become under our own feet\nOh certainly Randall left both in Wisconsin a nationally a truly has believe and still believes that you're fit\nHey they're rock and roll lovers this anti west flitting take a trip back to this week in rock and roll history\nStart off in Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bailed thirty bans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum south for them\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather is attacked by a man who hit them from behind them repeats the phrasing Kennedy what is the frequency prompting R.
