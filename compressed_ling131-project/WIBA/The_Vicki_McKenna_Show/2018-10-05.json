Garland work I Try to destroy him\nHis his kids were decent person is you know he's he's a wonderful liberal activists but we're not going to conform ... American people choose your president choose who they want to have joined the Senate the middle of the side of the constitutional\nCourt and yeah we're not going to we're not going to go see a ...\nThere's going to destroy and they are they have destroyed judge Kavanaugh\nAnd it's true in let's be clear his life as he knew it is done it is different it will never be the same ... you know the his family will never be the same the left will never stop pounding him in fact you know a prior to the show trials you as you so accurately describe it\nUm the kangaroo show trial actually he was um\n... left it already pledged to impeach him impeach him so this isn't done but his life is different fundamentally it fundamentally\nAltered in a way that his profound that is life on the you know life changing and dangerous quite frankly because I noticed that I'm reading stories today about multiple Republican senators getting death threats\nYou know this is this is the modern American laugh that is now the entire Democratic Party when Cory Booker who only a handful of years ago was trying to present himself a some sort of moderate Democrat\nIs saying things like it doesn't matter if it Brett Kavanaugh is guilty or or not guilty it doesn't matter that's Cory Booker that was a pretty rapid shift or Kirsten Gillibrand who who also was styling herself as as a moderate when when these people are embracing this idea that men\nDon't deserve due process that random accusations without evidence not not forget Christine Ford had zero evidence and a whole lot of problems with her story the laughter is now decided that four men\nWe don't even need to ask people to present evidence accusation will suffice and and this is coming from the mouths of formerly moderate Democrats who are in mainstream and reacting to the demands of their party that's what we have in store for us\nIt's going to unify the right in these upcoming terms I Hope so because it's terrifying what could be on the horizon if we don't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know ... years that they the the unions tried to shout down the actual reality of this reform this reform simply said that you can you can still be a member of the union it didn't eliminate unions\nUm you're going to actually have to allow your eggs you're existing membership to vote on the unions we'd at the state of Wisconsin and only going to be your ATM machine your bank machine here\nTo forcibly extract these union dues you're gonna have to pay twelve and a half percent for your health insurance premiums you're gonna have to make a fifty percent contribution to your retirement savings not its mind you because they're getting a pension and and school\nDistricts will have the flexibility to to create new rule hand books oh my gosh I'm doing my home alone face right now that's why you know but but eight years ago that that just very simple list of things this reform dad got blown out by this guy is going to come down\nAnd it's actually how I could opponents seem to still feel the teachers' union as just as powerful as it was eight years ago you know what we've seen is that teachers by and large are learning the union wasn't necessarily representing things they want them to at least be paying for right we're\nWe've seen a union de certification than many communities not because they're force but because teachers realize that they're not getting the bang for the buck for making those contributions\nAnd they'd rather use the money on their own families and things of that nature you know if you look at some of the rhetoric from the Democratic party you think the ... you think they are going to be paying attention to those teachers union votes just as much as they were eight years ago maybe they do to some extent\nWell you know shame on those sixty percent of um of of teachers who voluntarily decided that the union wasn't worth giving eighty or a hundred or a hundred and ten bucks a month to shame on those people because they're the ones who once given the opportunity and the freedom said no thanks [laughter]\nYou know saying hey things will Flanders I appreciate your coming on

just a status or trying to co op that term and make it meaning\nOr yeah make it meaningless but at the same time they want the approval they want the accolades they want to do the work to get the approval in the accolades but you're right\nIt's about making it's about making an American institution meaningless you ... you know you've seen this with the military thanks for the call man you've
