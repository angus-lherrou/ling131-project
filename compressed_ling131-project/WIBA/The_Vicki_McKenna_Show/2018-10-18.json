before introduce fail a Mackler who is one of the producers of the film and he's also the author of a companion book and one of the very few people who covered this story from the very very beginning I Want to read a review this is sort of an ad hoc review a listener of mine just sent\nYour Mickey powerful is an understatement I've been in movies where people clapped at the end I've seen other movies where people just got up and left at the end while the credits were rolling but I have never seen an entire audience that do the credits complete silence big strong grown men with\nTears in

when we got to the lobby it was crystal clear who had just come out of this movie and who did not a few women still crying some were hugging one another\nEven though we knew that doctors fate was going to be guilty and life in prison the movie was so well done it was able to place the audience in the clinic and in his home and in that courtroom in real time much like the creators of Apollo

heads up against walls you know I mean metaphorically you didn't harassed them in this movie this movie was told straight and was told um mostly using from what I understand the actual language of court transcripts the actual language of criminal complaints\nAnd and so it it played like a crime drama it didn't play like an anti abortion film\nAbout ... or make it a crime grow up a you know to make it a procedural procedures will no longer it looked like something you see them or something you see on TV um you know we didn't want to be\n... or ... people to relax knowing up we're on a movie out of them maybe to learn from the rebuttal coming up maybe it'll feel something from a motion of older um\n[noise] I think it worked um because you took so much of this directly from transcripts the dialogue in the movie based on the actual court transcripts the the conversations with the characters based on you know criminal complaints or or notes or court transcripts\nThe authenticity of this movie was absolutely overwhelming and in my opinion that's what gave it its power it was well acted it was well scripted it was beautifully directed but I think what gave it its power was that\nYou can hear people feel people saying these things and this was this was a story failing that people didn't want to tell they didn't want to the news media\nTo bring their groups to the movie theaters\nThis has to be successful but I've got the numbers up I don't think we're going to show that the church liberals don't do things that churches are groups liberals go to the movies they tickle for the culture of a change our children's mind this is what we got it through the young people ... back this because it than the movies they will respect the earth and you're right\nOr the clients all felt good point people that you need you to the movies\nAnd if it's in the ... the more people who buy the tickets the longer this run will last is important to point out as well instead of it being you know in the top ten put it in the top five put it in the top three if you can and if you haven't seen it yet see it I mean it's ...\nIt will change you it it will change you and it won't change you even if you're ... you're already you already know what you think about abortion you're coming out of that movie was was more you were coming out with knowledge you're coming out with more humanity you coming out with more humanity for people you may disagree with whether you are pro choice or pro life\nYou're still coming out of there with a better understanding of what the human soul is all about because there are people in that movie who politically it would be on the opposite side of me who I was in tears watching in that film and so I mean there isn't there there there's so much to take away from this film\nI'm not just finally the truth but more than that maybe the truth about maybe the truth about what it means to be human and what it means that uh so\nYeah I mean some people ... on your people are going to the theater that isn't in a theater near them they're buying tickets\nThe message and I was going to handle a hundred dollars to my congressman dollar my
