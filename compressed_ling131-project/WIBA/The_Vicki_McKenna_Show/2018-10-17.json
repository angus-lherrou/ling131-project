I Believe he's also national contact with the college Republicans a they're attacked\nBy a radical left his group on campus and instead of the radical left us who you know pushing shoving punch at the stand for college Republicans including Susan Rice his son\nThey're not the victims there the perpetrators of violence mind you all they did was basically get pushed around and slapped around\nThe Stanford Stanford a newspaper Stanford Daily reports that the the college Republicans were the ones doing violence by their presence their beliefs and their speech\nThat's it right simply by basis of who you are or the ideas you may contain even if you'd ever expressed than you are justified and whatever punishment or censorship they be allowed because you should not exist in their ideal progressive\nI had I had a similar experience when I was told that my my presence was violence when I went when I went to ... Shapiro few years ago at the University of Wisconsin Madison my very presence was violence and so what do you do to combat violence do\nYou know if if you're combating ... I mean don't you meet violence when my son is allowed to have to find the existence of something they don't like is violence then\nI don't know how you control that I don't think the Democrats know how to control that this is what they have on leashed what do we do about a chair of David Clarke\nI just saw you on Newsmax television and you were talking about this and exactly this what do you do to control a mob that appears to be uncontrollable or contain one that you ...\n... in the orchards drugs were\nFirst term governor ... ... ...\n... ... you know this is the upper echelon Henri says we plan to prevent things will turn or in New York now than we do we saw we saw it in New York\nHappening what's going on you know government is not going to ... in terms of sheep and if you see those ... you watch the world and there\nWere five years to be talking to you as long as she will still work so\nClosely long was the love of the stuff that they want\nOr they want to encourage me to defend themselves and then take things into the long hair and a large you know we don't have to do which is very strongly of one person to defend themselves and not having to happen or if you\nWeren't you you you don't want to Portland\nAnd not as familiar with the one in New York but I'm fairly familiar with one in Portland\nUm were you at antifa which is again just a mom and she was just a violin mob that should be declared a terrorist organization they're subversive organization that means to abandon\nFreely elected governments which they consider to be burned Jois I mean they they honestly believe the concept of elections to be you know somehow um offensive they attack a group of peaceful protesters\nAnd the police stand by in fact there was a man who was driving through in a in a car just to sit down and old man\nWho gets attacked because he makes a mistake of getting stuck in the area where this mob is please do nothing to him please do not think people will eventually do something either they'll they'll stop approach and that little shop showing up\nIn public events or they'll do something to protect themselves and then of course is what the mobs waiting for because they want to say see now they're coming after us now they're being violent\nAnd it was all over the um the for everybody knows for no other people\nThat they're not a empty fish the bond issues in there to tell them to make sure it won't object for confrontational compensation and the catalyst will if there's no other starred\nUh on the other side and certainly it turns on the police so they started to\nAttract the police so this is dealing with here but just go to church and the Democrats are in eastern witness for the Democratic party and that was you know prominent\nDemocrat and you know on the Democrats than to go and come down the actions of this mom vicious vicious\nWill tell that Jerry even very center of the week and I heard was really the first one of the TV show that he would not condemn the actions of open up the ...\nI don't know if it's out of fear or if it's because they're the the the the Democratic Party feels workers cross your that if we don't resort the fear and intimidation of political violence but this thing may come shaving in on this thing being a success that President Trump is trying to push back when we when the\nUh from the right not so much conservative lord wars pushback from the uh the RMC in that you really look at the cabinet nominations and confirmation as an example wanted me to go back home so they're very threatened courts is you know\nThere for your wall and they see that slipping away and so there for you too Neal\n... and do some traditional practice if you will in the political environment and on and on a show on YouTube this week about the dialogue anymore but the ... democratic concern aren't going to church with returning now\nTo like the church and she very timid Asian right oh love of checks and that sort of thing\nAnd and I'm just glad whining on your program and other talking about this particular year this this group was no\nGood people were evil and of course this media so that was over the top and\nIt was hard currently don't want to know them well and I don't do this for a for shock value or study though\nSo until Portsmouth decide that they're going to have to start using worthless people show up you know they're showing up when the adventures of looking for confrontation they showed up in Portland about a month ago there was another um rally but it's um patriot prayer\nAnd ethical showed up\nWith with sticks and bottle and and and another one night that the police were going off the street at that point we should have dispersed and when you don't Cherokee the rally they don't care to live with a pig looked on at the right way this country for ... by the way out of permit\nYou to spurs and the what he was all reasonable wars do so\nYou know the the reason a leftist media isn't going to condemn this or is going to call you all for being extreme it's all they know how to do their part of the transactional politics of this whole thing where they just simply look down shovel snow shovel their feet a little bit\nAnd because they they they racking it helps their side there aside their political side being the liberal political side that's why Mazie Hirono won't condemn it it's why Maxine Waters won't condemn it that's why no media is ever going to stick a microphone and Tammy Baldwin's face an ask her to condemn it\nYou won't see it because the media is is there at the same point where the radicals are where they're just like what else are we going to do to stop Trump what else are we going to do to stop the Republicans and so they they have made a transaction with with the mob\nHoping that if they don't report on the reality of it or they pretended isn't what it is that somehow the mob will leave them alone\nAnd at the end of the day the media gets eaten too because there are no nobody is radical enough for antifa they want anarchy they want to complete up ending of the system they want to impose their own violent vision of power on America\nAnd the Democrats thinking they can keep this rabbit dog on a leash that's delusional and the media thinking\nThey can keep the dog and a leashes delusional\nWell you know the leaders of the Democratic party they can do this or do you think back to the wall street\nWith an offshoot of\nThe group that was involved in it and you know the thing with with entry for though they are in in our group I'm Glad that we're starting to use the ... ... ... that's what they are under the student ... ... what the Democrats to go to church and\nThe color of the years since the ...\nTo rally a legitimate rally an aunt was shows a start but they'll start\nClips and so on who to choke\nSomebody on the side of the good guys responding to know all the\nWay they're also Democrats don't want them to do\nOn TV a total\nWelcome back to ... do you have that or do you have the a picture loaded up on the blog\nAre you laughing now I'm having pass or issues with my company ... oh no All right well um it may take a bed for days to solve his password issues or if you do have a Facebook account you can see the pictures of Halloween display\nIt will just it'll make you smile I Swear if if it's the only thing that makes you smile day\nGo look at it you know what I mean if you're just having a lousy day this will make you laugh I Swear it well unless you hate dogs in which case you know if nothing about dogs and uses you at all\nThen you might not think it's funny but anyway I sent it to my ... my that was laughing and and he's you know he\nHe takes some of the stuff that goes on in politics very seriously so uh I was happy to make my that smile alright um there's a caravan coming from Honduras\nOf Thirteen hundred some odd people um the march of the migrants citizen says it's not the first march of the migrants um but\nMaybe maybe we're beginning to get our\nArms around what seems to have become a saying in Central America not send your people in a caravan send with the United states had them crash the gate apply for asylum\nOr maybe they can disappear into the interior of the country where there isn't an enormous amount of enforcement\nAnd they're not our problem any longer Honduras has done this El Salvador has done this Chris ... your name right Chris from numbers usa is on the phone to talk about um commonsense change that has taken place but it certainly isn't a permanent solution good\nCivil or stat with when when you look at Mexico folks from Mexico that come in claim a file folks Salvador Guatemala whether their their asylum cases they tend to get rejected by the time they get before an immigration judge and that's why\nThat's why the sessions Lincoln th justices implementation of the session only get\nSo that's meant to cut it off at when they get to the border they make that credible fear claim they said do show that definition the international definition of violence that you have your persecution in your home country because of race which in\nThe ... a social social groups that you belong to or the color of skin it has nothing to do with\nBecause you fear criminal violence in your country back government era gal permanent violence in their country but that's not a ... ... ... ... they don't get me wrong they are leaving a terrible situation but it's not a\nBattery claim of silent ... you\nKnow and we're not in where I was talking about people claiming asylum only on caravans\nThis has been a problem and that has been exploited again for political benefit yes this is exactly all throughout the summer this has meant to try to drive attention to this issue and and had an impact I think in the mid term elections\nA an end to have a dramatic sort of photo opportunity Chris because you know all the all the uh news reporters will be down there and there will be pictures maybe even staged pictures of children\nUm even though the the lion share of people who are traveling on this caravan or adults\nUm you will see a manipulated picture of what's actually going on here and no one's going to ask the question why instead of funding efforts to help poor people in Honduras are you trying to affect us immigration policy during the mid term election season you know the reporters want to ask those questions because that's not what they're interested in\nRight and and that and that's what that's one of the key question there's\nI there's nine million people living in the door is can we allow all of that man yeah certainly most of them living in an extreme poverty and that and a country that are run by by criminal violent\nSo that backlash yeah but not the question will be asked about what what about you\nWhat about the mothers and fathers that are leaving their kids behind to join the caravan\nThey're separating their family down down from Central America and what about the ones that are taking their kid this is not a this is not you know just a a cross country road trip going through some of the office parts of Mexico territory that's controlled by by International Drug cartels are not exactly\nNot exactly safe territory that they need to cross in order to get to the U.S Mexico border\nWe do have a bill that it's been drafted it did I mean is it not been taken up as it did it just fail\nOn does it have to be reintroduced again as I understand apprehend them good latte has introduced a bill that would at least on the asylum question by the way I think this is how we ought to do immigration reform as opposed to one comprehensive thing I think we ought to boil it in individual pieces of legislation because it makes more sense\nIt doesn't get bogged down and deals\nUm is that is there any chance that we're going to see this um this bill taken up and and and head over to the Senate and in and maybe eventually get a signature by President Trump\nThat that's a that's a that's a million dollar question so if if this thing is if the care of an inch or less ...\nFate doesn't disrupt the elections and that comes after election day\nBook is heading into a lame duck session and they have to find a part for the homeland security back up or they only a short term bill to fund department of homeland security but they hopped out something by December fund the agency the rest of the fiscal year it'll be something that that gets slipped into effect bill\nBack to be one way to
