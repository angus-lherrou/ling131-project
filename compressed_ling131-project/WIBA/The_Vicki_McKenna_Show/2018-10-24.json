everything from taxation to health care to Medicare to spending um you know it's\n... and it's a cross fifty states we're seeing the same messaging and Wisconsin from the Democrats that we see in other states Republicans are going to take away people with preexisting conditions healthcare coverage they're going to blow up Medicare they're going to destroy Social Security\nAnd the list goes on like this um and it's it's pretty much a universal you know cut and paste and every single race here um how are we doing against what has become a universe allies political narrative\nBoat will know on November ... but ... I think the most the most galling pieces called misinformation literally as their claim that you're going to want to take away the protection on preexisting conditions you're not going to be further from the truth\nYes yes we want to repeal Obamacare because on the individual market these double triple quadruple literally placed\nPeople out of the healthcare market in ... and wants to do away

want to do it under an art character were dreams are double triple quadruple when we're making a very small American population bear the full\nCost burden of coverage people resisting and yet I cross conditions\nSo those are the Obamacare those are the people on Obamacare who are not subsidized are shouldering the entire burden of covering the costs the explosive costs\nOf all of the mandates of Obamacare I for the most part I'm not I have private insurance um but but what the Democrats were refused to accept was assembled changing the law and I find is I find is absolutely appalling that would have permitted people to get those short term limited to ration plans\nFor a year and allow those plans to be renewed these are people who have seen their Obamacare premiums which also come with massively hide adoptable double and triple I mean sometimes to the point of two thousand dollars a month\nThree thousand dollars a month who are able to potentially access a much lower cost plan that

something here that is not getting a lot of attention the reason I Want to talk about it is because many of you are going to early vote and you have\nNoticed that there are schools spending questions lots of schools spending questions on your ballot\nAnd because you don't see a lot of attention paid to school spending questions um you know you you you're not quite sure what to do do you vote yes do you vote no due to fall to know due to faulty asked are you just not vote on them\nUm that by the way is the expectation of other people who are enthusiastically in favor of the spending projects or buy a referendum but\nIt's it's also what ultimately happens if they pass do we struggle is on the phone with me to talk about this particularly school spending particularly school spending on buildings that are financed the referendum or do we I was really surprised to learn\nThat competitive bids in transparency are not required after voters agree to attacks commitment to a school project in the in the form of a building or something like that it was ... that was really surprised to learn that\nWell that is absolutely correct and I think a lot of other people are surprised by that also you look at all the government entities out there they already are required to open and transparent public bidding but there's only one that doesn't need to and those are school district and it's really led to some abuses in the system alright\nOthers have yours on and let's say a\nNew gymnasium or a new school building whatever reasons they're giving you here's something else that I was really surprised to learn that the contractors who are going to be building the buildings number one are selected in advance and number two who are actually helping election near the success of these referenda\nBut you know tell me how do unnecessary and extravagant building projects how does it make her kids smarter I'll just this really improve educational outcomes that's what I'm interested in intelligent investment described it it's going to result in educational outcomes that are improved and new buildings just don't cut it\nYou know what in fact when as you go back to that phrase needs analysis that that is sort of 'em have just it's it's actually a wants analysis um you know needs and wants and you don't even have any idea of whether it's it's it's necessary I'm looking at um a a person here who's complaining that the Wisconsin del school district\nIs asking again in a referendum question gets to something else that happens daily you'll lose once you come back the next year what the exact same referendum language now they used to come back on special election days in multiple times uh you know on on the same question over and over again at least because of your reform\nThere they have to wait a bed before they can ask the question again but they come back with the same question and he wants to know why in a school district is losing students\nThey're coming back for building referendum again um you know virtually the exact same claims they were making before and he can't get an answer that question because there is no transparency and nobody thinks he matters\nRight almost every school district in the state is losing enrollment a but it's crazy how they want to build new buildings but yeah the deck is stacked there's a lot of special interest you got the survey companies of course we've all heard about you've got the architect she got these journal contracts and contractors and believe me\nNobody makes a dime unless they do a referendum and build more building so where do you think their interests are going with this thing I mean it's just a it's a it's\nA it's a bad situation right now and you know part of it what made this all possible is the governor's pledge which I applaud him for says you're the median taxes real property taxes on a median price home\nHaving increased since two thousand ten and it's true but what they've done is we've been so hard and property taxes and the state and the character environment that we're in spite of the great\nGreat progress that we made this\nMan if we can keep our taxes level we're happy and really ... our taxes on property they should have been declining over the past eight years but these referendum everyone gets stacked on we just have to dig deeper and go into different pots in order to maintain the property tax level that's not happening by magic\nWhen he had all these referendum on it just it really kind of a yours a lot of the great progress that we have made in the state and I believe that the educational bureaucracy is taken advantage of that by doing what they're doing\nWe haven't seen a corresponding increase in school scores or anything like that because of all of the spending either doing\nHey I'm people can read more about this there's a really really good piece at the MacGyver Institute if you go to a guy for instance dot com it should be on their front page if not I have actually link this up and then also doing um you're in the daily reporter dot com and that should also be fairly easy to find but again if people are having a hard time finding to his opinion piece on this laying all of this out\nAnd make sure to link it up as well do we struggle thank you for what you're doing here because this is just one of those things that irritates taxpayers but for some reason doesn't find a lot of interest in legislators to to sort of you know raise the flag on it and make it an issue\n[noise] well there's a lot of propaganda author we're just trying to
