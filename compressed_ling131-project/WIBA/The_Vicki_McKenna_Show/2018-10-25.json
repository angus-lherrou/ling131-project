stage let me just give you an assessment of somebody from somebody who is there and tell me if this um squares with what you heard as well I got to pull up her she was she was a messaging me while she was um\n... you know in between you guys she says Trump leaves you feeling empowered\nI personally like I have a personal say in my government that was damn incredible he seems so genuine talks above below or at you\nFor a man of his wealth no leaders speak coming from him you come away feeling like you have a bond Sean Duffy Leah Vukmir Paul Ryan Scott Walker we're all outstanding I'm also Ryan's Glen they were great hanging I'm losing my space here my spawn here uh I'm excited it's crazy\nThis is the most excited I'd been in a long time\nIs a very good assessment it's truly amazing to watch him in action you know we were in that section off to the side of the stage that we were actually behind him to the side and one of his staff people were there with the\nHard copy of his script that was pretty funny it didn't take long for him to go off that script\nAnd it's just I looked around it the people and we all remarked about this afterwards just everybody was smiling as he was talking he's just in theory he has a way of just telling it like it is and it's refreshing and people I get and yes I was proud to be a part of that company of people that had the opportunity to speak at the pre program and\nIt wasn't expecting to get pulled up during Trump's speech but ... was very very cool and again he just makes you feel right at ease somebody's aren't you nervous going up there and I actually know hit it\nKind of enjoy that you know just being able to needle him a little bit because he needed me about the fact that I didn't support him in the primary so\n... you know and that's the thing when when I had a chance to talk with him when he cold call that's so get this about Trump people don't realize that he was cold calling radio stations he wasn't setting up interviews he cold called I didn't even believe it was him and so that was the only time I ever get a chance to interview him we fight the whole time but they were twenty minutes\nHe didn't talk above me he didn't act like it was an idiot he didn't he didn't do any of that dismisses stuff now\nAnd it turns out I was wrong about down near everything I said to him on the program that day but um but he gave me twenty minutes I thought he was cordial is always fun I thought he was personal as well and um and even though I came away\nWe always like this produced shares putting your interests first ... fear of

it's not because it's not a caravan um it's a political action that people who want to crash the gate and there is no three groups there's the first one from Honduras which as I understand that something somewhere in the neighbor to fourteen thousand\nThere was a second group that launched a few days ago from El Salvador and now it's third group has launched as well we should point out that every single one of them if Tammy Baldwin is elected antennae care is actually passed into law will be covered and the taxpayer dime\nExactly well this this chaos on the border and I know the little the left the extreme left in Tammy Baldwin is part of that they embrace that say like this chaos so I talked about cast for all on our Medicare for all at the border to\nI mean it is to me unbelievable and it it is a hot button issue when you're in Trump country everywhere I travel people want that border security and I stand with the president when he wants that border security\nBut these people are coming up our border agents cannot they're overwhelmed by what's happening and they know the three words the magical words I Want asylum so what happens [noise]\nThey get processed they're released it's a catch and release ... and you\nCan't even process this many people they they don't even bother to get process right they just come in and you're exactly right I Want asylum okay we're going to set you a court date well that could be in a month or that could be in two months we don't have detention facilities for this and so you disappear you you you observe gone into the country\nAnd we don't that's exactly what's happening all the way in March ... Canada arrest them abolish ice they don't want any interior enforcing any yeah sanctuary city\nIs abolishing ice no borders open borders it is\nSo extreme and Tammy Baldwin plays coy about it but she stands for that\nAnd and she needs to be called out on it and in the to the extent\nThat we do not stand with this president and get this taking care of it is going to be an enormous strain on our our country our resources and not to mention the fact that there are people right now we're going to a legal process of becoming ... immigrants and you know that I'm the daughter ... immigrants and\nMy some of my fondest childhood memories are helping my aunts and uncles learn English to assimilate into this country they wanted to become Americans these people want to come in and and enjoy all of the privileges of being Americans but not going through the process\nAnd the responsibility of becoming an American and that's wrong and that's why the ... the president has been very vocal on it and people are with them and think about that border for a couple of reasons are several reasons is not just illegal immigrants is drug trafficking it's human trafficking MS Thirteen members and you know what\nPublic health reasons we're having outbreaks on the border\nOf of various diseases and illnesses we all remember the days are the stories of grammar and so and so who is stuck it Alice island\nBut right now just come on and we've\nGot a strange polio like disease that is at the United states we've got to tuberculosis drug resistant tuberculosis we've got you know with diseases\nThat we'd never seen in the United states before but you're right and it's also the risk of\nTerrorism one hundred people affiliated with ISIS were arrested by Mexican authorities last week one hundred\n... from Bangladesh so these are people who are or sliding into this cold gray hair a van and pedophiles human traffickers drug traffickers cartel leaders people who wanna you know smuggle things into the country\nFolks maybe some folks do want to take advantage of social services maybe some people do want to leave their home countries but I got to tell you I I mean I'd like to know what the purpose of of the nation is is there is no border to enforce and if the border is there for a reason\nThen the laws must be enforced on the border I mean that it it it makes no sense to just say I'm I'm not anti American but I Want to raise the southern border of the United states that doesn't make any sense to you then you're not for America you're for Mexico El Salvador Honduras\nBut you're not for the United states because otherwise you'd say I want to help those countries but we need to maintain some some rational border security and this is why it's great to see the president is standing\nUp and he's standing up not just about building the wall but saying to these countries and saying to those leaders look\nYeah to stop this and and if anyone can do it this president can look he is made it known ever since he's gotten into office that he is not afraid to stand up to foreign leaders I mean heck he went with that with Kim Jong alone\nAnd I think this is refreshing that's another reason why you saw the energy last night people are refreshed by somebody who stands up and leave instead of the previous president who vowed to foreign leaders literally and figuratively they like this it's Reagan ask\nIf peace through strength and and and that's what inspires\nWhere ... where can people learn more about you leave a clear dot com all hands on deck it's

Cruz I did that are and I know you make you very much Matt\nKid all I Want to talk about white privilege I'm checking out\nThe proficiency scores of Wisconsin school students one would be hard pressed to describe them as positive one would be hard pressed to find anything optimistic in them at all and if you start looking at the sub groups in those numbers you seem Milwaukee schools with\nKids at eight percent proficiency\nIn mathematics or reading and then they were talking about black kids in Milwaukee schools Madison schools no better um and yet I'm looking at the article that MacGyver Institute ... macabre news service put out about a superintendent Tony Evers superintendents\nConference in Wisconsin dolls last weekend for teachers for educators\nAre they talking about how to improve black children's reading capacity or math skills or are they trying to ... are they talking about how to improve all kids reading capacity and math skills no math they're talking about\nWhite supremacy the patriarchy and how white people white teachers need to be made to feel awful and uncomfortable about being white and that is apparently going to be the ticket to grand success in education in Wisconsin I'm I'm actually under selling what happened over the weekend\nA truly amazing I I like the fact that you use the term capacity in our capacity to learn and to grow\nAs people end up students as educators what the keynote speaker for the superintendents conference on special education people\nEven Tony ... versus ... friends on education\nWhat this was truly all about was beginning capacity according to the keynote speaker Dakota or be who is\nThat's how you say that Dakota\nCoda or be okay who is looked like they do tell you used to be under the employee of uh Wisconsin\nTaxpayers was a an assistant or associate professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee\nA he has been um immersed in the white privilege Montrose white privilege of gender for a long time and he spoke to about five hundred special educators top level officials and pupil services we know this because\nUh a source attended this about not only attended but provided audio to us\nOr you can listen to that at MacGyver Institute dot com and hear what Dakota or be has to say and I bring it back to in in a capacity use that's the term that he uses in the ... capacity of the white educator to ever understand that they are racist\nYeah the emotional and intellectual in capacities to understand your race is\nYeah that's that's what this all about so it was all about\nThe teachers from what I understand from the the person your source\nIn fact some one one who stood up and said this is painting with a broad brush what I mean these are good people here they're trying to do right by their kids\nSo what's it but that's you know sit down and shut up because that just means you don't have the capacity you're incapacitated from understanding that you're part of the patriarchy and then I got a lot of things got rolled into this me to transgender non binary blah blah blah all wrong Donald Trump everything gets rolled into this came out\nThat teachers teachers take away from this Matt what would take away from a conference when you're there to learn how to get kids who can't read can't do math had difficulties even sitting in a classroom\nWhat is your take away on how to help those kids or didn't the kids ever figure into that\nWhat my source took away from this was white shame particularly white male shame because when the quota or be wasn't talking in generalities about how racist white people were and we live in a white supremacist society\nHe was telling all the white man in the room or that they cannot be trusted because they are rapists and a molesters\nAnd sexual abusers just like Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court so that's what he took out of it but what the crowd took away whether it was virtues signaling white shame whatever it may be\nWhat they did was they offered this guy a standing ovation after this conference was over which is the scarier thing because only a couple of people really stood up and said wait a minute here hold on\nWe need to challenge some of this think here's what he\n... it is to write down the word woman is an active resistance it's an act of resistance against the patriarchal world and a patriarchal society where men rape molest sexually assault women and we're just now in twenty eight teen starting to seriously deal with it that's a split infinitive by the way that's\nProbably why you wrote woman on your page because it's an act of resistance to say I am a woman\nThat's what he told the women in the crowd and well and then later on went on to say that white women senators Republican senators while we're

it will talk a little bit more about her race Matt ... of course I've\nGot Eric O'Keefe in the studio and Jim troopers is coming in as Well Eric so it's kind of it's the sort of feels like a friday for me party day kind of party they only without beer [laughter] it's great to have you on the program you know and ... just last week we're just chatting and he said something that I thought was um was grade\nAs we were just sort of talking about Jeremy Ryan segue boy the guy who ... who just got busted\nBy the fed for trying to buy a radioactive substance to murder someone um and now being charged in federal court as opposed to state court where he got slaps on the wrist and that says you know isn't it interesting where you look at a guy like that\nFelony drug offender guy beats up his girlfriend you know it's soliciting for poison to kill people he's\nA page after page and he kept so he's been slapped on the wrist this is one of the da's that wanted to put people like you and Dan Schorr at all in and ah RJ Johnson in prison for for conspiring\nTo commit free speech but you look at a at a at a complete peace and you know whatever like Jeremy Ryan and this guy's been able to get out and continue to scam and can you continue to commit crimes you're the real criminal apparently in the eyes of these days Eric and all you did want to speak\n[noise] yes and you mentioned earlier the sheriff's department and their passivity during the protests\nBut they were active during home region Dane County willing to go pray Don into family homes fully armed ah for people who are presented no danger at all and when the sheriff was confronted with the first story that came out about that he said no that didn't happen the next day she said oh that's just the way it's done\nI'm so I'm I'm not sure you knew what was going on and just as a ... but he was fine letting his guys go into family homes\nYeah let's not forget that in Dane County and and in Milwaukee County too but in Dane County\nPeople who who all they did was either make a donation to an ad that defended the Walker\nReforms or\nPart of a group that bought ads I mean that's what it was there a guinea basically you guys are being prosecuted for either supporting a group that buys ads or being a group that buys ads for crying out loud\nRight well you guys on the radio right\nAnd also supported the American effort and are there and there were leading women funders here just before women could vote here that could have a big impact in politics [noise] um it's uh the the abolition movement was funded by what today the leftward called dark money\nYeah isn't that true but ... in the end it needed money didn't it yet because they ... and it was a political movement of cultural and political movement and it needed funding\nThese this is what we that's our elections you know to suggest that only left wing money is okay so if it's the unions who are laundering their money if it's if it's you know the Democrats big\nBillion dollar donors laundering their money that's Perkins coy laundry and Hillary Clinton's campaign money\nFine we won't even talk about it but boy how the feds Americans for prosperity running some ads we we bring out we pull up the Boogie Man of the Koch brothers or if it's Eric O'Keefe\nAnd your club for growth in Wisconsin running ads then we pull out the bogeyman of dark money and and that's it's been like that the left and the media has treated that way asymmetrical for ages and they keep smack in their heads into the law going why can't we get these people to lose elections\nBecause their ideas are actually the things that people agree with and it's the dollars that get her ideas out to the masses because we can't count on them either do it\nYeah well I have an interesting test coming up because Republicans are being outspent and almost all the big contests and house races and she was she there doing raising huge money it'll be interesting to see how it goes and we were told the world would end if we got rid of the government accountability board\nUh because uh apparently we need to have government watching every dollar spent on politics and monitoring everything and uh planning home rage and here we have\nA they're gone they're gone and guess what we have allowed two sided campaign Democrats are raising a lot of money and if you if you believe the polls they have their best chance of winning the governor's\nA position of taking some legislative seats so what happened to that and the end of our democracy that was happening with the end up getting ... and maybe they should bring ...\nYeah that's the way it's always the end of democracy a democracy they don't care for the left doesn't care for democracy very much they certainly don't care for democracy when it doesn't go their way because democracy got Donald Trump elected when we live in a democracy we let our republic certainly but it's a Democratic Republic\nThey want to erect when when when the people those the the the people choose incorrectly Eric\nThey're not now they're talking about getting rid of the ability of the people to have a say we need to get rid of the Senate we need to get rid of the electoral college we need to just simply you know oh Blitzer right that the ... the articles of the constitution the elements of the constitution that are in the way of us running the table\nWith our progressive wisdom and our identity politics and our divide and conquer fascism\nRight there is there is all results are in their criticism of institutions has always based on what they think is in the way at the time for decades they use the Supreme Court to drive policy if the Supreme Court starts to get on their way they're gonna they're gonna\nEither stack of what you're talking about doing that or they're going to try to minimize a troll but it's all results aren't instead of an interest in the process the process and America was the great political\nDiscussion convention here which is worst fantastically it's a process the process policies weren't written into the constitution and don't policies it's all how do we resolve conflicts it's a rich\nMulti layered process at the federal level in the states have an important role\nThat process is what I fight to protect in politics and it anchored in the first amendment and engagement of the people I Want\nDemocrats giving money I Want and rich liberals giving money spending money on speech a trust the people just sort of they can tell sense from nonsense overtime it might make a mistake now and then but they're the best place to base for the government\nYou just now had the Democrats actually announced that they don't want the people involved anymore\nThey don't think that people should be involved there's a whole chunk of people they don't think should be ... ball Derek so North Dakota Wisconsin Minnesota Illinois all these all these people and flyover country then they want to exercise that group of people so that only\nNew York California New Jersey can have a say and what our national policy will be so unlike you they're quite uncomfortable it actually having to compete in the marketplace\nRight the right if it if they don't get their way they want to change the rules that sets that that's just their methods\nAnd sometimes when they change the rules by sending police officers to conservatives homes just because they might be winning elections hang on one second I'll be right back\nWhen the family of a young Marine Corps veteran lost their father

government is tremendously important I Want more attention paid to therefore I Want more money spent talking about\nThings are coming in in the program good to have yeah we're gonna take a break here the judge will join the next\nWho was that noble voicing your windows are the eyes in your home it's something the new law in the next time you look at your homes eyes or thinking about getting new

they are the best one was around and we're just awarded energy start partners for the six ... straight years [noise]\nAnd they're only available from genesis exterior\nTo accomplish this it's terrifying\nBut what what what what what ... and ... on a higher level I mean and this election is about it this this election and the election two years ago is about\nOur willingness\nTo give control government\nI mean that that fundamentally is that so so as I Am a\nMaking apple pies yesterday I'm listening to Milton\nFriedman says book on his original book it's about three or four hundred pages long and it's available on a ... so you can get a free actually and uh so I've been listening to it this fall and it's remarkable when he talks about government agencies\nAnd how they end up working and and and the point I wanted to make is\nHuman nature is what it is people ask me often um I I have many friends around the country who are very liberal um or even middle of the road Democrats sometimes they'll say how can you be a conservative Republican how can you do that Jim I mean we know we all you know you're\nYou read widely you know been around them all these things how can you do that they don't have ... they always have a little trouble because because I have been there [noise]\nUm intellectually so to speak I always say\nBecause the difference between a conservative and liberal or conservative in a progressive [noise] is that we acknowledge human failing\nThat that's what a fundamentally\nIf you are if you have Christian humility\nHumility to understand that we are deeply flawed as people we humans are flawed then you understand the limits we place on government you understand the limits we place on other people intruding upon you\nAnd it it it has nothing to do with a\nHatred of government ... government it has to do with understanding human nature and our founders understood human nature and they acknowledge with humility that it was necessary to have a balanced government they acknowledged with humility that it was necessary to have a country of laws\nThey acknowledge with humility that ... a civil society based upon religion based upon respect for other people wasn't us were essential components of a free society where liberty could flourish\nAnd and that is a fundamental difference that we saw play out in the twentieth century all over the world where repeatedly governments were handed power\nFor security or whatever the point would be for for as you were discussing earlier today because they had non humans whether they were non humans as as a\nMember of members of the Jewish faith or whether they were non humans as Christians or whether they were not in humans as a Asian or or African [noise] um or whatever in every instance what ever the justification was when you hand it the power over to a group of people\nOver everybody else that group of people ultimately abused the power\nBecause\nThat because they're bad people actually it's because they're human is because if you give them power\nUltimately they will use it\nAnd and and and they use it because they think it's ... percent\nThey may use it because they're just evil people\nBut they will use it they may use it because they're petty they may use it because they're bored they may use it because there's a whole bunch of reasons why human beings like\nPower but let's but let's acknowledge that and that's the fundamental question on the ballot that that's what's on the ballot this year again the on the ballot is the question if you're going to vote for a D\nThan what you are voting for is more government more control of your health care take more of your money and give it to other people but if you vote for an are what you're saying is I Believe that I Do not need government to run my life\nThat I Believe in limits on government that they believe in the ... the money I make is my money not the government's money those are\n... and but as I say that there's a fundamental question and you and I talk about this and we've been talking about this over and over since two thousand tend to those eleventh two thousand twelve the great riots the capital and then the John Doe investigation and every single time we come back to this simple principle and then in flawed\nAnd here's the question is this and I had a friend of mine who's no longer living in Wisconsin once ran for as a libertarian candidate for district to Congress Tim neurons fire they like to ... he liked to sum it up really simply by asking you to answer the question who owns you\nWho owns you you or them\nSo you decide who owns you and if it's you you vote for the person who is more comfortable letting you decide for you what's best for you and if you think they're on you then by all means vote for the person who is going to tell you what to do tell you what not to do or to your life\nAnd I I think that making it simpler for people I think is is is the easiest thing to do 'cause there's a whole bunch of different crazy things going on\nTrump represents the answer to that question who owns you his answer review\nAt the rally last night and I'm hearing from people who went to the rally I didn't get to go to the rally um but I was getting text messages from people who are at the rally\nThat was what they took away I felt and in fact when he read this to you I felt like I had to say I felt like this was not about him that this was about me I got to get to this one friend of mine who was I thought I thought you know quite eloquent about it she says Trump leaves you feeling empowered\nAs if I personally had a say in my government will your show\nShe says it's damn it feels good he's so genuine he doesn't talk above below or at you for being a man of his wealth Noah leaders speak here I came away feeling like I have a bond\nDusty book near Ryan Walker oh outstanding a Ron Johnson Glenn gross men and Ryan's amazing to say I'm excited is is just miniscule I had an amazing time I feel great\nIt's found that they don't want ... she's ... that that person is saying what I've been to what I was trying to say here are much more eloquently which is that\nLook your choice is whether you wish to be empowered or wish you or you wish to empower other people over you and and by the way I that simple it is that simple and every time we come down to these issues\nI I Know you and I have talked about local politics and the same way on occasion where you go to your town board or your city council and and what's their first reaction when someone wants to build a building or someone wants to wreck the monument or someone wants to change something\nWhat we have to prove it here thirty seven layers of government that you have to go through what wait a minute wait a minute shouldn't be the reverse how do we make it possible for you to do how can we help we have chosen to do\nLet's make ... here's a great example when I went to when I when I Lived in Madison I'm Glad you brought up local I wanted to put a fence so I went and I found them plans and what I was supposed to do and I had the ... jam and then someone complained and I was
