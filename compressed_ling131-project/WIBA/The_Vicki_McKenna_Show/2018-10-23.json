love to ask you\nUm about your impression on on what's going on with the with the with what's being called the migrant caravan I'm first off it's not just a bunch of people in an ad hoc way getting together and deciding that they're just looking for the good life in the United states this was an organized effort\nI guess my question is do you think this is this is an effort on behalf of the politics of the midterms rather than a sincere effort to try to help people from other countries\nFirst of all you hear about the cell phone service in rural northern Wisconsin tricky but like what the care of and you know I think I think this is a group of ... toward the caravan\nBecause they want a Porsche immigration agenda and if you look at the panic Boehner has not been engaging if election cycle around the country and I think they believe that if they're able to have this migrant pair of an issue in play politically motivated to Spanish Banks\nAutomatic exact opposite of

Republican they're working for me I'm not with the liberal progressive wanna who want to offer me free thing that actually don't offer me um anything\nWell they are that lives on little progress anymore because they are what they are they're socialist I was pleased to see the White House released a report\nThat actually talks about the impact of socialism the Democrats are no longer um even pretending to be anything by their socialist so let's start talking about what socialism dies and socialism we'll put a wet blanket over the Wisconsin economy will choke off economic growth in the United states economy\nWill reduce freedom increase misery increase poverty and make opportunities scares and that's I mean I I'm pleased to finally see Republicans talking about\nSocialism and Donald Trump talking about socialism because the left has been trying to find a way to soft sell socialism for the for the better part of the last\nFour or five decades now we get to actually\nHave someone who's willing to pointed out and say oh by the way what you're seeing here would they're promoting is exactly the thing that destroyed Venezuela that destroyed China that destroyed Cuba and so I'm I'm I I think that we need to start calling them what they actually are in their heart of hearts Sean\nI agree and I look at our own communities\nIn ... in Wisconsin but also just in the Midwest we love freedom um and when you have caught to the policies were you consolidate power within the state within the deep state with a bureaucrats in Washington you reduce liberty and freedom all across the country and\nUm we don't mind you know helping we wouldn't want to help each other out we when we let people up when they fall on a hard time however\nWhen you consolidate power in the state and you give them you know over fifty percent of your tax dollars you give them your your your healthcare your food your housing their shelter um they control you and that's why we go you know what we can take care of ourselves will help each other before our time but I Do that freedom this American model of free enterprise\nWe have we have developed the strongest most prosperous greatest economy\nThat ever existed on the basis of the earth and when and when I was trying to mimic our economy\nThey do find the ... that we have in Korea and American style free enterprise ... what do you go this liberal model socialism where ever tried to keep wherever implemented wherever you empower government over people you have to bear you ever shrinking middle class\nYou have a greater poverty last upward mobility and he consolidate power and money and the lead in that in in that country or that community to impose is that um that social from and so I think Americans are too smart for what liberals are offering and our policy that we've debated with Democrats will ask you know ten years\nThey had eight years Obama saw his big government collected the tax\nIdeas in ... I'm into a recovery and prosperity we've seen in the last two years but the ideas that you and I talk about with normal for Twenty years when we have two years of what our policies get implemented and and work we see the end result which is we get the result of of what liberals Palmer\nBut conservative limited government low tax policies actually deliver which has opportunity prosperity upper mobility and wage growth\nYeah I I again exactly when you give us just two years not even the full slate of conservative policy or look what's happened I mean it's a boomerang effect as I've said many times in this program a boomerang affecting the economy the big bullies people's confidence\nUm you know the Democrats and I don't I don't know what they have to sell they have to sell you know ...

great lawyers who happened to be conservatives in their approach to doing their job\nThat's a good thing that's what Wisconsin watch you don't want a liberal activist attorney general who's going to decide what the law should be based on their beliefs you want an attorney general who's going to force them to start at the way the legislature wrote it and that's exactly what we do\n[noise] you know
