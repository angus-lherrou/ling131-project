P. A. in the department of the interior and health and Human Services do\nWill expand our authority and then the courts saying\nThe meanwhile\nCan't rain anybody yeah and not not not overtly unless he just wants to use it an executive order or some some sort of tool like that\nSo we basically have only ... you know people throwing all their\nOther eggs into the basket of electing a president\nOr cheering on or jeering on a Supreme Court nominee and that's yeah that's basically that's why our court matters so much are high court matters so much that's why everybody's you know so uptight about the executive we shouldn't be worrying about the you know the people in the Supreme Court they should just be following the constitution\nAnd and the president should be able to respect the constitution because he doesn't want to get slapped down by the Supreme Court\nAll of that is true and that hasn't actually been happening it hasn't happened since Nineteen thirty five when\nIn Nineteen thirty five in two cases\nAh the Supreme Court said uh you have gone a Congress has provided legislative authority who the president and that violates the constitution because the constitution\nSays only the Congress can make laws in other words only Congress has legislative authority such so much discretion was given to the president and a couple of instances in Nineteen thirty five sets the Supreme Court struck down\nWhat happened after that was that FDR who was the president\nOf had a huge landslide victory in Nineteen thirty six and then proposed at seven new people to the Supreme Court\nUm in other words putting the court and the physician where he is and controlled yeah um that was called the court packing plan it was it did knock pass Congress fortunately but the court got\nScared they felt they could not take on the ministry days when the president\nWill differ um it's from encounter books and the judicial fortitude is by Peter Wallison and it is from encounter above you can\nFind it encounter books dot com um he is a with American Enterprise Institute I'm a great pleasure to have you on the program Peter thank you thank you that could go daddy we're right back\nWe help accident victims we fight to get them full justice nothing what that means all of the law says your injuries cause medical bills lost wages and compensation for all your pain and suffering now and in the future\nAt Clifford and dry hole we rely on thorough analysis detail preparation and uh\n... it's ... we'll give you information inch by inch ah hopefully next week I go back to Washington DC and sit down directory I got back commitment from him out of our lapsed a hearing\nOr to to start getting responses to our letters rather than the non response response we're getting this she got a ticket anywhere near this this amount of time wanted to remove them so much time is a special counsel investigation\nThat came out in a hearing again as well said I think given information because there's a criminal investigation\nThat's the problem you know and so the American people don't know what pulled off and they should have known really is it a few months\nI'll be grade we should've known exactly was pulling off and here to Eighteen Nineteen twenty months later and again we're getting the pieces we have a general sales we think we probably know what it's going to look like well we don't have the heart and pass evidence is incredibly frustrating\nToo well but the thing that American\nIf you read this and I'm I'm using um a a a pretty decent article that was generated over the weekend by the Daily Caller if people are willing to suffer by daddy handling this up and folks want to go see it\nUm but the sit coms at least in in a in a great regard according to a Congressman John ... class a ... ... and ... and his description of what he's been learning\nThroughout the process of the house intelligence committee working\nPapadopoulos was the excuse to generate\nThe call for the special counsel\nAnd if Papadopoulos was not ... and the FBI knew Papadopoulos was not guilty isn't it appears from what we've been learning recently and that was what was used to bolster the the nonsense about the Steele dossier for the five of surveillance warrants and that was used to call for the special investigation\nThan this hiding behind the curtain of a criminal investigation is one hundred percent both gifts and the ice and you know the frustrating thing is someone's got to see it like that the person who can say it is President Trump\nAnd I don't know if he's just moved on or if this is just not something that that is interesting enough to take you know to to to make it to the top of the heap\nYou know one one of the problems you you really have is the people that are left or news agencies and what kind of information to really provided one of the question I asked director is how how many people have actually looked at before on redacted\nOf fires the applications in any I didn't expect to be the answer the answer the question but my guess is probably dozens there there are people in there and I'm not really see myself up here but they're subordinate to the United states senators know to protect the FBI Director can take a look at it we actually prefer his nomination\nThose are subordinate officers to members of Congress and yet members of Congress except for very select few intelligence committee may be chairman of it\nWe can't take a little bit and I think that is absolutely absurd males one of the points are trying to make out but the other point I tried to make is just like ripping off a band aid that's what we ought to be doing here we are a rip off the bat they get all the information out\nFor the course of suspicion is this information is being held isn't being would fail because of national security consideration is being withheld because it's embarrassing to the agency and Vicki if when we finally get to the bottom of this that's that is really the the reason why this information's been withheld\nDon't trust me I old really create one heck of a rocket ship\nAll right so I think you're right I'm particularly because ah the congressman unions last week said much the same this isn't about national security\nThis is about embarrassing people this is about embarrassing um maybe somebody eat some folks who are holdovers from the Obama administration people involved with Hillary Clinton possibly some some foreign allies even might be embarrassed but it's not national security that anybody is protecting here\nUm but here's the thing you were talking to direct or re last week and I watched a portion of your grilling director re\nFitting that man said last in more time and then I remember most you know the last bureaucrat I watch the hearing he\nTried very hard not to say much and eat up an awful lot of time doing it but he could not even answer a simple question who investigates the investigators who investigates the investigators Congress investigates the investigators\nAnd that didn't occur to him or he just didn't want to say it I'm not exactly sleeping asleep of angels because Christopher Wray is in control\nYou know what's going on I think you know when I asked them who invested in these you said the opposite that general which is the correct answer then I said well would there be any other other entity that would be charged responsibility to rescue investigators completely baffle\nI really think he was completely believing in what I was talking about because the obvious answer is Congress and that was the problem you have all these heads of these agencies departments there is really no way for Congress to strengthen the administration for not providing the information that they should be providing in our\nWho didn't oversight capacity and as a result\nThey're literally just ignoring Congress time to time to get it and mystery shopping ministry nation and the people making these they they do this they ignore\nCongress with impunity and that is the problem but I'm you know I'm going to do everything I can do and that type of attitude\nBecause because they know what what are you gonna do to him and he yelled Congress held Eric Holder in contempt so what\nSo what that is what they that's their attitude toward this is where the bureaucracy we outlast these guys on there and a lot of them might not even be around after the next election so what\nYou know ray was also ridiculously claiming that everybody trust the FBI run everybody doesn't trust the FBI and while I Know you like to say that the vast majority of the good men and women at the FBI do an excellent job that's not what we're talking about here trust in the institution is probably at an all time low if anybody ever bother to pull it\nNobody trusts the F ... at least nobody on the right side of the political ... trust the FBI we think the FBI's exist to this point at least in the most powerful levels on it\nTo go to to to criminalize politics on behalf of the Democrats\nOr so it didn't trust under drugs are combing the Obama administration and its ... more ... more than frustrated the fact that the with drug ... there were still not going to the bottom of this and that was the whole purpose of my question is do you understand the lack of krill credibility FBI and I'm not sure he fully graphs that the\nWhole purpose of doing this oversight is restore credibility FBI because that means extremely important the department of justice and the FBI are considered credible impartial and they've got a great deal of integrity and right now that is not the case\nQuestion is\nWhy don't we have the information that President Trump said he was going to react in mid September why hasn't been information been redacted why are we why are we still sitting on that who has his ear who could have talked him out of doing what his God told them was the right thing\nYou know all your fist trying to step in and these agencies throwing up every possible it skews it was saying oh we get some we got some intelligence from this a foreign nation and they won't share and tells them you know who knows who knows what kind of a ... but it's disturbing made right now\nAnd what Britain Great Britain\nFrance Great Britain isn't going to share intelligence to bed [laughter] that's that's who they have to be referring to\nThat I have no idea either color and the president to completely\nIf you haven't
