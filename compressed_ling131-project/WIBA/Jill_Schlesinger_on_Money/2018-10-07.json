I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ... ... s really good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed for I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each interact with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's\nKnown as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there is asserting innocence about it but I think it really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's\nIt's something that anybody of any of any of any faith and creed hum what is like a dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid with an eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or

figure out what to do with your money\nAnd you've got all this equity in your real estate for the first thing that pops up for me is that you're pretty real estate heavy you've got some cash I don't know what you need in terms of extra money you're making you know fifty grand in in\nYou know sort of general wage income but she looks like you're making a lot more money in income that's probably why the cash was a piling up I think what you may want to consider is\nTalking to somebody I don't think you should do this on your own it's as you know you don't seem like you have a lot of experience with this um\nYou know if you want you can build a diversified portfolio by yourself you could do that you could go to ed I'm an investment advisor that's on line if you're comfortable with that\nThere are loads of them out there\nBut I think that the most important thing that you need to figure out is what are your needs what are you trying to accomplish as you start putting this money to work and then what is the best allocation for me I don't know what your needs are maybe this cash is unnecessary maybe you're building up a hundred grand and cash every single year I don't
