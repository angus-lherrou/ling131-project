I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who are protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that is kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nThat right I Am a nuanced the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for that believe all the things you're told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh ... and the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bump like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some of the some of his only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist and not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff that ... thing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and throw happens the biggest one is October which\nWill never go well\nI Do it really is I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the states is open so I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but but other than realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now is certainly open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem\nIt ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like to be around that time of year there's not that many curb but in October for instance the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table\nAnd climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start hitting the train and\nStart having their cars so there that's really good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad though\nWhere they got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's the real which happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much

I I Can't use a person's name so let me change some facts that this is somebody who is um\nRecently widowed and and retired and now is trying to say how can I generate enough income from a portfolio\nOkay and the portfolio value is three hundred fifty thousand dollars total okay and the person wants to generate Fifteen thousand dollars a year\nOkay got that down now remember how we talked about retirement in the past that when you have this big lump sum\nYou want to try to determine how much money you can pull out of it safely without plowing through the whole thing and this person is in the late sixties\nLife at age wise and so\nYou know probably could live twenty twenty five more years here's a question how can I invest this three hundred fifty grand and get my Fifteen thousand dollars a year out of it and here it is\nWith relatives safety okay [noise] the problem with this is\nTo get relative safety what are you asking for are you saying I Can't bear fluctuations at all are you saying that I can bear some slight fluctuations but I Can't live through one of those gut wrenching\nDumps in the stock market I don't know uh this person has an advisor who looked at a combination of short term and long term bond funds and\nUm and some preferred stock\nAnd and and the preferred stock has a yield of about four point three percent which is kind of interesting\nFor point three percent is not bad I mean preferred stock sort of trade it's [noise] it's essentially an income producing product because the stock pays a stated dividend but the stock price can still fluctuate\nSo if you look at this um what is the game plan here\nSome bonds some preferred stock I don't think you're going to get Fifteen grand a year out of that portfolio\nConsistently without depleting because if you even if you have long term bonds and short term bonds even if you have some preferred stock I think you're going to be essentially digging into your principal\nAnd I think that if you were willing to drop your income expectations\nThen um I think you might be able to do it but\nI mean I'm thinking more like ten grand a year and three fifty that would that would make it seem more reasonable to me all of this being said when people say I want relatives safety you really have to define what you mean okay you really have to define that for yourself\nAnd then you'll have to articulate that to your advisor or someone who are if you're working with somebody or put that into practice I think when you're in a low interest rate environment and look even though we're seeing the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and things are happening um and and the rate environment is changing we're still relatively speaking\nAt a level that is low interest rates and you know the ten year bond is paying three percent\nIt and you weren't relatives safety that you're that you're bogey three percent\nAnd if you only can live on three percent of three fifty right then what are we talking about\nThen we're talking about like ten grand so I think that ten is probably the number you would have to feel comfortable with on an annual basis\nIf you want relative safety All right let's do this one also um this is can I use this name let's see I've got a ... ...\nIs a transportation and for infrastructure electrician the union hasn't had a contract in twelve years\nA week ago

'til now\nSay you that now even if you're not a freelancer today doesn't matter so twenty Eighteen you got this money and make sure you withhold some portion of it because you're going to pay tax on

tried to do it yourself and save the money\nMy two cents a greetings I have a question for my neighbor this is bill who sit writing a young man is going to heritage four hundred acre farm and it might be worth\nEight thousand dollars and acre how can you get a better income stream from this asset other than renting it out how can you get some good benefit from this when Phil and makes about thirty eight thousand dollars is a teacher he's not inheriting any Barnes or equipment just open good ground I don't know if they'll have to pay quite a lot of inheritance tax or not thoughts\nI don't know what to do with a farm you're asking the wrong gal miss New York over here but what I Would say is if you're inheriting a four hundred acre farm in and the state was worth\nLess than at eleven million bucks or twenty two million if it's a fat if a married couple then there shouldn't be any inheritance tax\nI don't know what to do it I mean I Would presume that you should talk to real tours and discuss the situation otherwise maybe even you know if you can't really create an income stream maybe just sell it\nOn there would not be a big capital gains 'cause it's based on the date of death valuation and you get three point two million bucks I don't know that seems pretty good to me anyway because I don't\nAt a place of worship I'm Pam who sales Fox News I synagogue in Pittsburgh the latest target of a person with a gun\n[laughter]\nNow it's two thousand eight doing these complicated drug cases explain what happens when you get this call like Hey Neal come to my office what is the actual time where what\nWhat we're worry so it was um it was an October two thousand eight surely after the bill passed that authorized the bank bailout and\nIn addition to in the drug cases I did securities fraud prosecutions I tried the uh the former executives of Ratko ah the commodity giant that that collapsed a couple of years earlier and then also it started a mortgage fraud group\nAnd so ... you know as the financial crisis began all this mortgage fraud became very apparent\nWait so you are doing mortgage fraud when like back in two thousand seven like as the housing market kept her later than that\nWe formed a group I Believe it was in March or April of two thousand and eight so okay just as as the you know as as it was really becoming a parent that one of the drivers of this oncoming crisis I'm was the fraud that underlie so many of these securities that ultimately blew up and\nSay that senator military to at least with like what was happening like hey this thing happened you obviously are a student of of the news as well see you see the bear Stearns thing blows up and you see that now things are escalating and you now come into the fall and we've had\nThe Lehman Brothers bankruptcy we've had ... we had a the bank holding company thing and then we have tarp\nRight and when tarp was originally envisioned as it was sold was they were going to go out and buy\nResidential mortgage backed securities and the derivatives that were associated with them so I had a background of prosecuting securities fraud and also investigating mortgage related fraud so I think that when my us attorney called me up and asked me if I Would be interested he thought okay here's someone who's got expertise and both mortgage fraud and securities fraud\nAnd the idea is to help protect this seven hundred billion dollar bailout which again with that point was going to buy a whole bunch of mortgage backed securities that would be prone to fraud and who is the U.S attorney at that time was might Garcia he's now currently on the New York state court of appeal the highest court in New York\nOkay so my calls you and you've got a good relationship with them in your season guy what do you think that call is about when you first get that call\nI remember at first I go up into his office and starts talking about this the bailout and I don't really know what do you see I exactly what he's talking about but he starts describing that there's this new job that's going to be created in a bill called us special inspector general I don't really know what that meant I wasn't aware that the bill had that\nAnd he sort of explain that it was partly going to be a police force a sort of an FBI for the tarp a law enforcement agency that would police or the money and make sure that criminals wouldn't try to take advantage of it and if they did to investigate them to bring up the justice\nAnd then the flip side was an auditing function sort of like uh doing types of audits a G.
