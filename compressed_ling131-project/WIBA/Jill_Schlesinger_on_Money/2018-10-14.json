the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines the isolation chamber huh\nAh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research a matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they all\nSo how to go deeper and meditation very quickly out a remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are tall for interested in different

have you be in ... so I can hear your voice but\nI happily will answer your emails it's just that we are consistently are digging out from under our email list it just you know I'm going back back back in time but uh so we don't get too quickly give us a break come on we're doing our best just me and mark here at Jill on money\nThat's it two of us\nOkay Mike writes he's fifty four years old his wife is fifty six he wants to retire and the next couple of years if possible are homeless paid for it we've got no other debt I'm estimating we need about\nA hundred and twenty five to a hundred and fifty grand a year to live the lifestyle we want to live I make one twenty five and my wife makes twenty and I contribute to Eighteen percent into my four one Kay what do you mean that how could you need a hundred you mean you need more money than what you're living on now\nThat's a little nutty okay let's go with it he's gives me the breakdown of his assets money in a retirement plans let's call it about nine hundred fifty grand in a tax deferred\nAnd then some money and robots and taxable accounts a one\nPoint nine million bucks it's about uh sixty forty max\nOK so question what types of account should my money being once I retire and start to drawing the money\nWell I mean you could leave it as is uh he's got most of his money and vanguard that seems fine to me um the retirement accounts you can roll over since you like vanguard well okay I'll take their guard that's fine good low cost funds that seems to be reasonable to me\nUm so that's good okay most of my nine hundred grand uh\nWith my old employers should I Move with the vanguard yes no fees Adel it's literally just\nYou a direct role of her from a four O. one K. straight to a roll over IRA he says I Love to move it into a Roth IRA if\nPossible well if you do you're going to pay tax on nine hundred thousand dollars so I'm betting you probably don't want to do that how long do you think I Need to be ... to be working to have an income of a hundred and twenty five to a hundred and fifty thousand um well you didn't give me your Social Security estimate but let's presume that\nRight now you've got this one point nine million let's say if he says I Want to work I Want to retire in another ... let's say by the time you retire I don't know you have\nTo two million to pointless just rounded up let's say two million bucks because some of the money you have you have to keep in cash so it's not going to be invested so here's a good rule of thumb\nThe two million bucks probably going to generate something around Seventy grand some of that money is taxable though right cause some of it is in a taxable account so um\nIf you add in Social Security maybe it's another twenty five grand maybe it's thirty together you got a hundred thousand you're short right you need one twenty five to one fifty so I think you've got a couple of problems number one is I think teacher\nEstimating that you need I think that your your aspiration of wanting to spend\nOne twenty five to one fifty if that's a net number then you're going to be working a lot longer than the next couple of years if however you want to retire when you are before the you know under the age of claiming Social Security which seems like you are\nAnd then you're you're really going to have to reduce your expectations bottom line here Mike is I think there's a disconnect I think that based on what the numbers you give me I'm guessing you probably need to work probably till your full retirement age for Social Security sixty five six seven probably sixty six\nAnd that's ten years and in\nTen years then you'll be you'll have built up that nest egg even more if you will have not dipped into it and then you'll be able to pull out the money you need but if you really want that much money there's no way you're going to do this and the next couple of years so no it's not possible\nBut I think he got option what I Would do is start crunching some numbers that's the number one thing to take control of this ah Angela\nSays she's fifty two years old she's single she's working hard to save over Seventy percent of her income\nOh my God anyway um she wants to retired at age sixty two over the past five years she really ticked up for saving she's got a that five hundred grand on she currently has a Seventy\nThirty mix on her asset allocation Seventy riskier stuffed thirty not so risky returns of under a just under five percent is less than ... ideal for six and a half percent goal I asked about increasing my investment to an eighty twenty model and they discourage presumes she means her\nInvestment professionals when\nI Know about my early years of investments was the most logical investment for performance were David and paying stocks I now have some ... but net but not all can I make my next round of investment strictly and David and paying investments on my own without an agent would this be a mistake I fifty grand to shift into investments should I Move\nOr or give direction to my if it sounds like you don't like your financial advisor first of all I Would not actually say at fifty two years old you need to go to eighty twenty\nI think that the reality is that you don't get a ton more upside but you do start to freak yourself out when things go down if you don't have confidence in your financial advisor then move everything out and save yourself some money\nUm and also frankly maybe you should kind of pulled back your expectations here two questions here about people who want to retire early ladies and gentlemen I cannot explain to you how much better it is to keep working\nThe math just works so much better and so as a result I really want to encourage you before you start saying I Want to retired\nThis young this young this young whatever that is important to try to run the numbers and don't take risk to make it up\nThat's not going to be the best thing you can do is save the second best thing you can do is work longer the third best thing you can do is invest and not be a ... and lose money on the downside\nHow 'bout that\nThere is a nice little video for you mark an audio clip

that\nPerson so he as name was friends for the long he\nJust wanted a friend just got to throw the friend out African ... okay so he's South African with a\nFrench name yes and as he French by

this start us so we started\nUm I you know actually that was more of his brainchild he worked at a couple of start ups when he was in business school and really had that entrepreneurial bug I didn't I was pretty happy at McKinsey I was probably you\nKnow year or so off or making partner and you know life was life is pretty good as far as consulting went we were getting hired to sink a through the um Affordable Care act strategy for that company so this was around\nTwenty eleven twenty twelve um when the Affordable CARE Act adjustment past but it hadn't been implemented yet right and so nobody knew what these exchanges we're going to look like what products we are going to be on there\nUm and so McKenzie a bill to practice so they had a built in exchange simulation with real consumers multiple products and so we were helping big insurance companies figure out\nHow consumers were going to engage on these quote unquote exchanges\nBefore anybody knew what they would look like crime he

mostly health insurance is that you're focused to begin with or is it I mean now you have everything there but what was the start\nThe start interestingly enough and when we launched in twenty fourteen was for products life insurance long term disability insurance that insurance and renters insurance\nSo we didn't start with health insurance there is still too much uncertainty it was the first open enrollment season a under the Affordable CARE Act so we're like you know what let's let the dust settled before we tackle health insurance\nAnd so we have those for products ah we wanted a mix of products that uh we're kind of bigger ticket more complicated like life and disability and then smaller products that you could you know just by with a credit card or like renters in pets\nBecause we didn't know what consumers would want and what they would engage with our hypothesis was that pet insurance was going to go through the roof right right um and it was life insurance\nWow it off is our number one product immediately and was it term life was the first term life so when I look at the website right now which is policy genius dot com and I click on life
