have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian ... another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the ... of the secret to his own that\nYou're kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe okay that\nArea it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this was the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an\nAn unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the top where we'll be higher closer to God and the spirits\nThe way I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're\nInclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill and also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being spared guidance for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\n'em and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to prove the survival of

R. P. C. program was comparable and perhaps a little bit more encompassing\nI wasn't familiar with the C. R. P.

R. P. C. which is um you know interesting and just again because I never heard of it\nOn\nIs a mark that actually comes from the college for financial planning that was the one that originated the CFPB\nPay and um so I mean it's a legitimate title\nI don't I Can't say whether or not I would be able to um [noise] say whether one is better or equal to the other I guess that's my most important\nPiece on the registered financial consultant\nAnd that seems like kind of a a a finger at one I think that's a from the financial industry regulatory authority here's what it says here a candidate has to three years fulltime experience as a financial planning print practitioners so that's the same as see if they\nRequired licenses to engage in financial planning profession a sound record of business integrity know suspension or ... any professional designations or licenses must be in good standing with all licensing bodies\nFor the house a house closing for how she sold nine years ago\nI'm going to say no I don't think you need that at all um so I don't think I'm I'm sure that can go into the old shredder on\nEspecially if you sold the house and you don't need any you know you pay the taxes on it you're now passed that seven your time horizon\nI'd say get fire up the shredder get going I'm\nHere's somebody who is asking about credit card debt and wants to know about the debt relief companies and he says I don't know if they're legitimate guess what I don't think there are legitimate either most I mean I think they're legitimate most of them are legitimate but there are rip off and the ones that aren't legitimate you want to stay away from so you\nI think for a lot of people who are in credit card debt and they're worried about interest rates going up I I worry about home equity loans he asked about should I get a home equity line of credit it could be a good way to go but\nYou may want to just try a plain old installment loan and there are a lot of companies that are starting to do this um we had one of the these guys on the air with us um two of the guys rather from Marcus by Goldman Sachs\nAnd they're a personal installment loans\nAnd I think that\nMeaning that you take the money from them and then you start paying and they're no feed their fix rates you can borrow up to forty grand so I Would check that out go to mark his dot com and try that one [noise] who\nGot through a lot of emails on that little segment there right mark [noise]\nVery proud of myself okay you're listening to Jill on money how 'bout to our website Jill and money dot com sign up for our free weekly newsletter we'll be right back\nWhen we got the best of all ... of your credit investors with tensions in the middle east and the U.S global economy experiencing record growth\nThe demand for crude oil continues to soar if you're the credit investor looking to invest at least one hundred thousand dollars you can take advantage of these rising oil prices it's time to consider selling some of your stocks and turning those profits from the market into an approved tax savings called encore now\nAnd learn how you can deduct one hundred percent\nOf your investment and create twenty or more years of potential monthly income on court energy is drilling in an area that's potentially what are the most prolific horizontal oil plays in the eastern us invest in oil and create big tax write offs for this year called eight hundred eight three three Seventy nine forty four if you're a high net worth SEC accredited investor who's interested\nIn participating directly would approve an operator been called encore energy encore is just made a recent new oil discovery\nCall now eight hundred a three three Seventy nine forty four hundred a three three Seventy nine forty four to find out what this could mean for you\nJim ... he\nUsed up ...

of a growth mindset he had he was just so curious himself\nAnd he said let's go democratize hospitality together and I said well that sounds pretty good\nAnd so you started with I think eight hours a
