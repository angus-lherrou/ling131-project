I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWe we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in there is nothing I Want bad enough to go back into debt\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish that only the money to do but I'm not quite dead for it even for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good\nWithout any payments so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up to think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I say either you know piecemeal out of your income you know what I mean the payments you save up some money to fix up the Algerian as you said there is some upgrades or if you want to move save up you know shape hard for a couple of years\nYou probably save up to a degree in two years without any payments if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out in pulsing riding around on a Sunday afternoon solve this particular property while that one's not gonna be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do I'm not going to be mad at you either way\nI just couldn't do it there's no way Ariana is with us in Canada hey Ariana how are you\nI think if I can I call and thank you so much for your ministry thank you how can I help him a long distance plan like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who I've my penance by default [laughter]\nI'm asked her own place currently sitting on the the entire complex that it and has gone down in value from my unit is very Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm terrified that unit of the same style and land is mine and I know the lower\nPrice as like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday a Himalayan it came on the market five thousand less than one hundred Ninety five out then\nI started to feel a bit of age and feed a ... because it sitting in the winter is coming you know I was thinking of shopping my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out over paid six months worth of condo feet ...\nDoing out there with me and I would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket on the market is discharged and my question is how\nWould you how much would you pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHow you'd ... obviously you have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland I don't know how it uh what am I to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and you know that's going to give me my urgency\nUm I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market I've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so I'm without dropping another fifty thousand no I wouldn't\nKnow [laughter] you know so you know so in some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but ... but five thousand out of pocket to be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that too 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case accounting and when the pay is not a place to move in wintertime\nWell but I mean not only does I mean this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now exactly yeah\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's starting to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right uh I don't think you're panicking with the numbers you're giving me now have you started telling me somebody wants to\nOffer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket what thirty grand I'm probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nMy ... in it and wait on spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing\nGood question I'm sure you're facing this open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five things for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I'm now got over a million people on Instagram\nWow and I'm just now figuring out how to do it myself\nUm the guys at work here do it and when I actually put a picture up there are people freak out so it doesn't it cause I'm not very good at it but um I got pretty good at Twitter but nobody's on Twitter Twitter bad except except a bunch of trolls I mean it's just a bunch of angry\nPeople that um don't have a real identity or whatever so Instagram nice people by and large not all but\nA block and one woman that was being a\nTest pilot from a broom factory the other day but\nUm anyway Instagram\nAndrea by the end of the month will have four months of expenses saved\nDo we save up for a down payment on a home or do we start investing were both at the same time we'd love to buy by the end of next year I think it's fine to wait for\nOne year the starch your baby steps for we call that baby step three baby if you postpone your retirement savings for a short period of time to save up a big juicy fat down payment\nAnd if you can do that in a year and I think you can sounds like you've got this thing on the run you're out of debt you got your emergency fund ding ding you've done this the right way you move into the house the house is going to be a blessing not a curse it's going to be a\nDream not a nightmare\nCultural felt nothing going on at home that's obvious I can answer that question every day\nAnd by the way those of you out there who would judge Judy fans have you noticed she's getting less and less and less tolerant of the ignorance that walks into that TV I a courtroom\nI guarantee you she's a short time a guarantee it\nI I Can't talk to this level of stupidity I Can't I Can't associate with this to steal from an avid Sandler movie yeah Adam Sandler movie I I just I Am now dumber for having heard you say what you just said is\nSomebody walks up to me as an adult and says oh I'm On call\nSomething's wrong\nBut if I point out the reality of no momma no data or more times than I Know that some time somehow some way I'm not being right just said my ah in my analysis\nWas your brain go into his pending yeah stop stop yourself right now save your own save your community don't worry about what I'm saying on the radio\nBut if if there's a shred of humanity and the thug if that person can be a help in any way shape or form I'm a fan of doing that I don't believe every kid's name needs to be on a record\nWhat we now have young ladies or was it a week ago uh for disorderly conduct locked up in the fall it locked up for ... for disorderly conduct let me tell you something Madison police officers don't get to a scene like that looking to lock anybody up\nAll right kids being a moron let's try to show them out a little bit back them off their own stupidity see how that works\nBut again if you're asking police them to a a mediate and moderate situations uh okay fine\nUh but I Need to be a very direct in my language or this pissed pulled culture in your house is that they're not your head yes I Know you don't understand what I just said because you don't know any better\n\nAnd I believe the Madison police department in Dane County sheriff's office or somewhat progressive and I don't think that's a bad thing if you can save a life by God save it if you don't have to put every kid's name on a record don't do it\n\nBut again we've joked about on this air what a what I as a kid thinking I was a tough guy back in the streets of Brooklyn I wasn't so tough\nJust took a a couple of very wise police officer to wake you up to that and the and the media words if you said the mere words to me uh All right fine well up we're going to bring home I'm going to let your parents do like a ... just to show me now where's my self give me a sell give me a prison number I Want my three squares that they don't call my dad actually ask\nBut if you're grabbing your crotch and sucking your teeth fit me there's not a lot to communicate with they're the only thing there's only one thing that person understands that's more than ... thug in response\nAnd many of the people that I knew it was a kid who thought they were tough guys and thugs took the back of the cops had laid them out yeah I Know that doesn't fly today doesn't work today\nSo I you know we could just resort to if you don't you know if you don't want us you fix it but you can't fix it can you\nKnow regrettably when you when you start to reach misdemeanor in felony offenses you can't negotiate that yeah yeah there's got to be a price to pay there's got to be accountability\nAnd again they encounter uses very strong language I understand that\nI Believe and professionalism either again if I'm representing I if I was to be representing a law enforcement agency or a security company or like the great professionals at NPR security and our buddies Sean Smith or who works hand in hand with the Madison police department when it comes to active shooter training and a lot of great stuff\nUm Madison is a great agency and you need to wake up to that great detectives on that job\nI had the privilege to speak with a couple of retired or a detective good people man really good people regrettably when you get a lot of practice you become great detectives and they're getting a lot of practice but\nWhen she comes out and said listen there needs to be some accountability here juvenile justice nice to have some teeth in it I'm not asking you to Rona life if you don't have to I'm speaking for myself though a and cheap coal I I Believe is absolutely correct in saying we need our judges and we need our district attorney to get involved in this\nWe need some accountability we heard mayor solving a talk about the facility the holding facility uh okay I certainly don't want anybody in a in a sales are that they're right in ... but there needs to be the er accountability as some fear of the system\nNo I'm not going to do that because this will happen to me if you don't do a you won't get the there needs to be that healthy fear of the system\nDo I appreciate the cops out there today a developing good relationships with young people yes yes I Do\nAre you shocked and taken aback when I was in uniform on the streets of Brooklyn New York back in the day I I make people laugh all the time\nWalked into some of the most insane family disputes in the history of mankind and within four or five minutes of the great a power great and powerful ongoing daily we would solve this situation we didn't want to beat anybody up we didn't want to lock anybody\nUp and we became great judges right there on the scene\nNow there was a very large Caribbean that population the crown heights Brooklyn still is and we would ask the very very important question do you have any ... house yes mine we do don't worry we can solve this problem or we sit down and we need to talk [noise]\nBut I Do you think are cheap coal is wrong for saying hey you need some accountability that it has some teeth got kind of bite into the problem a little bit\n\n[laughter] I don't believe in a you know at some point when you started when it starts committed felonies and yet you got to you've got a piece in your hand gets wind you've reached in other level have you cross the river kind of my mind I Believe you'll have\nTo I Believe that that child is still approachable that minor child feel approachable yes\nBut that minor child was approached at a tender age as well that might or a child was uh was influenced by celebration of sub behavior early on during a tender age\nWhen you talk about those truth that is true that is true I Know that offend you but it's true and it needs to be discussed\nNow I Know I could take a thousand phone calls right not saying oh it was a kid we all we've all had the conversation me especially\n\nBut if we're going to have our our local district attorney or if we need to learn it at that individual to weigh in on this and to get serious and we need our judicial system to weigh in on this well we don't have the facilities oh great that's not a response yeah that's not a response do\nGo ahead do you do you ... and I are part of I think what Paul saga was saying was was also kind of echoed by the by the circuit court in here in Dade County\nAway the facility is run it well Lincoln Hills is not it it's not in any way the kind of place I think that most that and then I think that part of the frustration is and I I ... I understand why the cheap is\nIs very frustrating you're doing your job you're doing this word right there doesn't seem to be like an intermediary it's either\nIt's either we're sending you are back on the streets with the GPS and at worst we're we're packing up and we're sending you up to copper lake or Lincoln Hills which are pretty notorious in in the judges are saying uh you know we don't want to be put them in these in these facilities either for the ... there there seems to be a massive\nDeficiency of kind of like ... okay what do we do with these with these young offenders we don't want to certainly send them to these I Know they call them on a care centers or whatever but the F ... and so we don't we don't want to send them to the youth vote on\nI'm going to shock you are right yes I one hundred percent agree with you yeah what do I uh I digress [laughter] Hi I'm a he and I ... I have an idea\nStay with me on this a classroom setting and if it will give you the classroom setting and you need to show up every day and we won't put you in a facility\nBut it's going to be called culture clash whoa yeah you're going to sit properly you're not going to suck your teeth you're not going to grab your crotch you're going to learn how to effectively communicate with other members of society\nAnd we get we're going to have signs on the wall speak properly that's not cultural that is stupid\n[laughter] hang up now am I referring to a to an education style showing people that that I may have been raised on that might have been an influence in my life that might have a guy to being in a certain way and I think you know once Mickey up as we are going through the first break an hour standby will pick up after the break\nUh but you know what I was taught like you you know at the uh educational cultural environment on my home was like Sean people\nWant to you know what am I going to happen I don't know if you are no private Bob are you ready to believe that you don't know what but right now so they knew that that aren't perfect you know so\nSharing five and file for driving while\nAnd not do anything to hide like they're starting to do in Chicago that's what they're going to do and\nJail for the kids should not be a pleasant experience agreed it should be a you know poor old rule under their bars and and and and let them lick it up off the floor everyday kind of a thing\nBecause I mean all joking aside all joking aside out I mean I Believe there needs to be an academic classroom setting and cultural studies need to be a part of that if if you want to go to college in larger advance you know are not had a cultural studies that's fine but American culture studies that needs to be part of ah the punitive or an arrangement I think\nWell see I taught for I was ... I was a school teacher and my wife and I thought the time of kittens Thirteen Years old he's either made or he's broken you're not going to take a Thirteen year old and put them in a in a in a seat in the classroom you know somebody tell them about what to do\nI but I disagree completely I Believe you can save is sixteen Seventeen Eighteen year old I really do believe you could say that they were broken I'll admit that\nAh but again when you when you take\nUm the approach of a A N again my dad had to write because again Dan was no stranger to fun\nAnd I made it my mission because of the uh uh the insane insane about atmosphere that I grew up and I I just read you know rallied against it I railed against it all the time and the fact is at the end of the day you know I did eventually penetrate my skill\nThat you know what I'm doing the wrong thing here and I knew I was doing the wrong thing um and now that's half the battle these kids don't even know they're doing something wrong they think it's just keeping it real or that needs to change\nYou might be able to save a sixteen year old kid if you could put him in total environment where he's not still hanging out with this gangster buddies and stuff like that but that's not going to happen we're not gonna take kids out of their homes and put them in in in camp or were\nThere ... or ... let's say this let's say this sale or not every home is bad either not every home with a single mom is a bad home a lot of these women are trying desperately hard every day and I do believe these these young men are being taught the right thing at home and they just think keeping it real is the is the more important aspect of this ah\nLike like with the gang these kids when they're born\nThere in the gang that their parents were young single mother or not they're they're born into their gang it's not like the ... meetings and recruit killed [laughter] like that these kids are born into their game and there are probably the third or fourth generation that's been a member of the gang and the whole neighborhood isn't the same gang\nAlright I'll I I appreciate your call thanks for your time today I Want to keep moving here uh prevail you a bottom of the outbreak here don't if we could ah yeah let's do that will take the bottom of the outbreak we have Bob from Oregon and Jim is well plenty of time left\nHanging their fellows will pick you up after the right three two one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five thirteenth ... this is the con ratio there's talk Thirteen ten W why being

talking about um the blog posts from cheap coal and I I I Believe the man is right accountability has to what a\nAll we we just have liquor laws shovel the dog\nYeah when you speak to me in a pedantic self righteous professorial way ah my little ... and I tell you something right now are there needs to be immediate action on this and if you're going to building that could be utilized utilize it\nOr you need to sign a few cops do it do it\nWhether it's a group a tenor of this group of thirty find it there there are some place you could stick these kids enough we'll find out what's going wrong\n\nOr oh well all those stories are not you can't handle the street you can handle the road you can't handle uh your your city don't talk to us anymore just the just lock it up step away step out of the way of the adult conversation might be done at the front\nThat's all\nAnd again you know I I don't know the man personally but I've seen him in action ones burglar publicly I wasn't impressed\nNow but I you know I don't usually called do the name calling thing that's ridiculous my apologize for that I'm three two one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten let's go to Bob from Oregon and then we got the gym hey Bob how you doing you're on the income ratio happy birthday to you about growing at\nYeah say you know I I grew up in Madison and what we do and I grew up in Madison it was a big small town or real safe place you do you really out there and get your kid and you're always going to steal it\nAll of the gun and he's there and now now I met Paul he's a nice guy um you know for our folks in Madison a dirt or action coming up\nA police police chief call all run for office run for we need somebody but the um\nPeople that are already declared to win\nOr even more insane then demand the truth there he's the only oh I hate to say that the that gee how those\nPeople he's actually he's actually you know and he's actually made some rational decision sweat because when you're you're on a corner and you have no choice and you have to be economically realistic I bet it's forced them to make some rational decisions and a and there's been some other comments and stuff out there but ah\nAh again you know the further left you go out the worst your city is going to get the worst ah things are going to get because they're just it's the police's fault no it's not\nNo it's not the cops are the Japanese are in our country are you there the political point that they're the ones who use and uh\nYou know I I you know when I whenever I hear the phrase well there were only following orders well they did okay we've heard that the excuse of your time for back in ... but um\nI Will say this ah ... you know if you allow the police to do their job and if you have a cooperative district attorney's office and I and judges to realize the importance of what they decide that the end of the day\nUm it it's it's a really big deal and there's ... to me it's a no brainer that you say All right we've got to sit down again get on the same page here that's not a big deal to me and I don't know why it's not being done by the second that's what needs to be done\nAnd you know Madison really does need those extra officers in the absolute slap in the face of the men\nAnd women of the math and police force to not have enough back up to take care of situations like this a core group of thirty kids they say the police say are the ones causing so much of these problems\nYeah I yeah I think about what you just said do you grow up in Madison Bob\nAnd I and I think about my friends the Marlins and I you know I've met the Madison Marlene and my great friends down in Janesville they were all Madison morning a Marlins at one point and I'm\nA they all they talk about the history of the city and the green Bush section and you're you're back to the moon shining a era here in Madison or just said that there's really a ... it's a great town it really is a great deal but just entering\nAnd somebody got a cultural resources here and and and the education uh I mean during the medical community here just\nLike yeah this this part of the world's speaks to the rest of the nation it really does why in the world for that matter\nUm and and that doesn't need to be surrender because\nYou know if somebody wants to turn a very serious issue into a political issue that's what annoys me and um and and Bob it's uh it's getting obscene ... thanks thanks for the call Bob you have a great day pop for your time let's go to a gym on line to has been very very patient hey Jim how are you you're on the air and con ratio happy hump day 'til you think you\nGood afternoon I'm Around a repeat something similar to that I went to school there in the
