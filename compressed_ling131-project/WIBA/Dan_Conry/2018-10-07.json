a\nAnd a large my picks told it was fine I ... yeah but that was with help from DC wasn't it so her I I Can't remember exactly which company but they did get some help with the pixel designed fair

in the prior you I I'm\nA has a a ... well we haven't seen the the follow up to the last of us so\nNow that I think would have been a qualifier that would have been the ... I I think I I just think that this is really interesting it shines a light on on you know a part of the community that doesn't always get a spotlight and I think that that's phenomenal\nNet neutrality may be dead but that isn't about to stop California they've passed new legislation that enforces net neutrality on the state level in fact laws or more strict than the federal ones were the department of justice however as moving the opposite they filed a lawsuit against the state of California less than two hours\nThe bill was signed into law well this is interesting so yeah now the states are going to try to enforce net neutrality while\nSomebody has to I mean yeah I Do a ideally yeah um you can't have a ISPs running roughshod\nA over their customers which first of all I watch a California ... yes of course um but you know the ... it's the sad part is is that they've proven they're willing to do stuff like that again and again and again if given the opportunity so um I think that there does need to be some protections\nAre obviously and and I've been a a a big advocate along with the F ... uh for net neutrality for a long time so I think that this is a good way now that on a federal level it's been struck him down or I I think that this is a good way to ah to to bring that that issue back to the forefront\nFederal government moving to you know obviously blocked doesn't stop that from happening I don't know whether or not they succeed the point is it's going to bring the arts\nAnd back into the mainstream again back into the right into the light we're going to get another you

points the sport and gaining radio my name's need vendor so glad to have you along we're broadcasting from the sports business summit at the Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas and I am so excited to welcome in with us Nathan hands or the VP and commissioner for\nThe over watched ... thank you so much for your time today no problem\nI'll always happy to talk with other needs\n[laughter] yes the U.S go stand over there the guy that bit of a country of Nate Silver hair cells are among fans and and you know industry folks there seems to be a pretty big divide as to you know how many teams are being added into the O W all for the second season what the importance of expanding the franchise so quickly\nI think you know we started with twelve teams that are are not euro season this year a solid a success and saw a lot of success um was building phantom in local markets and we want to bring you know the the vision is that we bring the rush to lead to to to top cities all around the world and get fans\nAn opportunity to go and engage with the concept alive and connects other fans\nAnd so we ... we had an opportunity after our first season to to bring on teams and markets where we didn't have a a much of a presence or any presents\nAnd so bring it seemed to to to France or with our parents franchise or three additional teams in China or two teams in Canada super exciting to bring teams to to new places\nAre and also so you think about a a future state um where we'll be playing you know sort of a home and home format which is your eventual goal yeah is that you really need we need to start building you know regional concentrations of teams uh you know if you think about the way a traditional sports league operates\nYou have a regional conferences or divisions were teams play you know more within that reason than they do a outside of it I think\nUm you know one of our goals they rushed leagues that everybody plays everybody around the world and that's one of the things is so compelling about it as it is a global league have Somali but I think it's also important for us that regional concentrations of teams as well so ... to say that\nThat need for a regional concentration is one of the reasons we're seeing so much expansion into China going into season too\nYeah exactly so we have five teams in Asia now right um which you know start starts to feel like a real division so and and and obviously a two teams currently uh in in in Europe and that that will continue to be a key focus for us to to add additional teams there\nSo uh going out looking in season one just from an obviously this was the inaugural season of over watch league and I think by just about any metric you can imagine it would you'd have to say it was a success or what what what is a blizzards feeling and what is your feelings overall in season one of the ... yeah\nI think we agree I think it was really successful first season I think we achieved a a lot of our objectives want it to launch the league in a in a big way I'm going to build a fan bases national school fan base it also start to build our local brands we saw really awesome uh you know sort of grassroots organic\nFandom develop in in in our cities around the world a fan clubs in viewing parties and all those things just sort of sort of happening organically and then to be able to the top off an awesome season with grand finals in Berkeley center was\nAn incredible events or are they is atmosphere there was a unlike almost ... not just the sports of him just sports event I've ever been to really really great way to finish the season and our looking you know moving on to twenty Nineteen or how do we make it I'll even better\nI I Want to draw attention to a word to use their organic because there's a there's a tendency ah we have this new each sport where you know closer to come in and has really pushed over watch to be any sport and there's a worry sometimes among fans like it's going to feel very very packaged and very more apartheid and yet or when we went out to the sports arena or to the Burbank arena\nOr we saw a lot of that organic as we saw the guy show up with the seagull head on and and you know become part of the broadcast effectively like it's still has that very natural organic each sports feel to it\nYeah we have awesome fans are I think you know over watched the over watched community in general is a huge super passionate community around the game and it's been awesome to see the community develop around the overall actually\nWe wanted to create opportunities you know Missouri and it was a great a hub uh for that fandom throughout the season this year but you know as we move moving between that you know beyond we really want to start to get out of just being in Burbank and bring that experience to more more fans around the world\n... VP and a commissioner for the O W ... is our guest here on checkpoint\nYou know um I I wanted to look ahead to a season to end this season three so you know as as we're looking towards a moving into a the second season and the third season one other regions are you looking to expand to\nYeah I Would say you don't you think about\nExpansion there's a couple of facets there there's the obvious one which is expansion teams right there is also expansion in terms of the content that we create and so you know we are not grow season constantly broadcast in English French Korean and Chinese\nUm you know that's another area that we're looking at in terms of expansion you know what other language dreams and we want to add to what other uh uh types of costs of doing a ... want to create for different groups of fans around the world says one one thing we look at it\nFrom an expansion team perspective is I mentioned that they were really focus on Europe in adding an additional teams or whether that's in Germany and Scandinavia and Spain [noise]\nUm I I think that will be a big focus for us going forward or you know there is also emerging reasons as well that are quite interesting like Latin America the middle East I'm a Southeast Asia so I I think I think\nYou do is we think about what's compelling about over watch a as a as a sport is it is a nice sport is that at school um [noise] that we are we're players all over the world and so we want our lead to to be reflective of the fact that this is a game played by a people\nAll over the voting ... we would never ever want to tell you how to do your job but the torch had as demanding that we as there is a region here and the U.S called the mid west where it is covered in snow for half the year and we have nothing else to do is right ha a it's a it's a big part of the country and there's nothing for us to do have the air we would love an over watched him\nYou know you know they said it was like\nA big city it's ...\nI I I feel that there's a condo Chicago's around there yeah\nThat would be that'd be that I Would prefer Detroit personally by [laughter] I think\nYeah I Would say um I think\n... nothing is ever definite that I I think I I feel very strongly that at some point we'll we'll\nHave a a Midwest team and the ... uh there's some awesome cities in that part of it\nCountry and and it really is a region that bring one it's a region that is ripe for each sports were really thrilled to be getting more deep into these sports same\nAbsolutely you know one of the one of the questions that I have um and I feel free if you can't tell us feel free can't tell us but when are we going to get to see you know some of the branding behind these new season two teams I'm really excited to find out you know what some of\nThe team names are see some of the logos all in my email right here no oh no [laughter] do we get an exclusive know\nHa ha ha ... got some work to do no honestly I mean it's going to be awesome I think I think one of one of the things that I'm most proud of of the inaugural season was I think the the visual identity that Russia like everything from the team branch in the mold and all that stuff I think that came together incredibly well\nAnd uh you know that I think we're really excited we're that into a new teams where we've been working very hard for the last couple of months with them on the names and the brand name we're making lots of really good progress and I think a a ... you won't have to wait very much longer I think we'll ... we'll start to see those coming out and I think ah fans are going to be pretty stoked\nSo with the inaugural season over and season to you know just a few months away what were some of the biggest challenges of a season one that you're hoping to address in overcoming season to\nSay one challenge those talks about a lot ... was was sort of a a player rest and player fatigue and that makes sense and so I I think we we spend a lot of time this off season thinking about\nUm what's the right number of matches the play what's the the right format from a match schedule week to week one of the right times we sort of uh have the luxury of\nThis only being our second season so we don't we don't we don't have to do what we did last year we writing constantly uh of all of it and read on it so I think when we announced the the format is scheduled for ... I think there you you'll definitely there will be some changes okay um but I think those changes really driven by conversations that we've had players with teams that are partners\nOr to to really address uh what was ... you know sort of brought up a lot and talked about in the community of uh players not just having a restaurant players also having opportunity to go back to their homework at you know we we will um you know be spending a lot of time in Burbank next year\nAnd we want to have teams have the ability to do you know like when when Houston went to the Houston and did a autograph signing with the rise in Dallas at the same thing we're going to have your team's more of an opportunity to do that have time or break start the season to go uh and and spend time in the markets and engagement fans like\nOne of the strong points of blizzard has always been the willingness to adapt we saw that at the end stage one last year with with changing kind of how the playoff format was going to work because obviously what happened didn't work okay let's try something different\nAnd I want to hover on what you were mentioning about a player rest because ah in season three\nWill can't travel and as stressful as maybe planes many games there were this season when you if you had to add travel on top of that it would be exhausting for the players what are some of the things that we're going to look forward to to try and make that a realistic a goal for season three yeah I I I ... it's", "show_name": "Dan Conry", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "07"}
