nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer\nOr to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here\nAre based on what you said because you didn't know oh you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they applauded the company but it's a superior court action a ... at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant right it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have been dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn interviews you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are\nThen there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a lot of like\nYou know there's no there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter sue on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation is not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but as for just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you'd probably get your lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file or respond\nYes you do yes you do when thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help with that on an\nAvid attorney I could just you know\nYou can do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of that yeah you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research uh that talks about the fences and their affirmative defense is\nBut uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research I absolutely\nLorraine Lorraine welcome to handle on law I bail yes\nI took my car in the habit that this is a chattering noise in my car instead of fixing that no I think my brakes which were perfect when I took the car and driver Kay\nSure ah you have a chase them and then you have to pay for all right ah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're gonna get a fact that he didn't fix the noise ah you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battering you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and ah I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome they\nWanted to ask you a for years whenever I see my dentist he's trying to uh talked me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more than a\nI've been chewing on for ten years no no uh no problem [laughter] and trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a big three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do it three thirty five hundred dollars and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down the to write\nTo cheat on each side yes I have one that I've\nBeen in structured and cooking for three and a half we thought it was a little down it didn't [laughter] I've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now they sent me to an end\nTo on this yesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canal grounded proved them too much for the call is almost to the store\nOr that's lovely okay so what's your question\nThough his response of uh my original dental responses is just one of those things that happen\nAround now does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're ...\nI mean all you have to do you have a bad too if you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was putting in decades ago before implants where you've been around so I I have no choice or by I mean the guy from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis that'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much is dental malpractice wore\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another down to get a second opinion just say this is crazy this is not just one of those things would happen this is malpractice on its face and then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are and there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in doing then get it straightened out and send them a bell I mean you can assume anyway and\nIf it's under ten thousand dollars a year ago and there was no problem and go to small claims court another problem was going to be you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna you're going to have to bring in a dentist or dental a dentist who is going to be a witness because he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things and it just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay\nAnd then I let her be maybe\nOr bring in lots of them are bringing in two or three and then see what the judge has to say\nOK okay alright try yeah\nGenesis he spent all these years talking unit doing something in in ... when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nOh I Know you've probably heard by now or the new hack or Facebook actually Facebook\nHas had to within a couple of weeks of each other and it's kind of crazy how many tens of millions\nOf people have had

affiliation\nOr how well first of all are your what is your religion and\nOkay and I'm assuming you're not a wild ... liberal is that fair to say oh got it and you're not yeah but I kept to myself you know an addict alright so uh the discrimination is ah how ah was it showed you\nUm she made a comment in front of a couple of other than she hates Christian\nOkay now ... that's all she did she say she hate Christian were you fired where you've demoted or were you held back for promotion or is it just she hates Christian\nShe luck man so I couldn't transfer out I've heard of it and then a lemonade and my position [noise] wow okay it's protected by her by her good friend\nWho is no doubt a VP at a Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] or somewhat of that ilk\nYeah here's here's the problem\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on his face it looks like it is straight out discrimination so there doesn't seem\nTo be a a lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and\nAh your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot of a just a tremendous amount of power\nFor example I Know the company that had a and it's a company that is in its it's in the spotlight immune set people know about this company and there was an issue uh an African American who was working there\nAnd I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and and I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you gonna go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of races I Know\nWe shut down the division as a as a business decision I see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nMy performance for better than the three parents put together but that's what you say it as I have proof that day and\n... but even so he's had division part is going to be a horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean\nThat she's going to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that and you it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew\n[laughter] horrible huh you see I work on that a lot truly [laughter]\nAll right Laura that yeah I mean is it it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was in a dead bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof here it is a you know what I Want to fire you today I'm your boss I just don't like you anymore boom you're gone

company I've never heard of them I have no idea what you are that are said to them but they're alleging that I work with two of them get the ... he works for them\nOh yeah there's no ... and what do you how is where's the fraud\nWell they're they're saying that that I was working with him to use their credit cards and their company to do on the program I think it is I have a very clear okay\nAnd are they so when you have they filed the lawsuit\nI I was there a law suit and it is that some so\nIt's a it's a lawsuit for you to defend you don't know anything about it\nThey like it yeah you're right well how ... how much are they asking how much are they asking for\nThey're not out or anything\nAnd the ... so they were just asking according to prove just small claims are superior court\nYou know there was a lot about a lot of guys being caught like like eight or nine other home but people that you will\nDo it but it was but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer\nOr to get you out of it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here are based on what you said because you didn't know oh you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they brought in the company but it's a superior court action\nOr you know at this point I I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the uh the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant\nRight it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court dismissed and a lawyer actually gives a damn interviews you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are\nThen there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just trying to do I know there's not going to\nGo there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous law suits or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation I may not be true\nBut it is an allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started showing your neighbor and there is no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you're probably aware especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I write in the other the attorney but I also have to ... bond\nYes you do yes you do thirty days you have to follow respond and you need some that are beyond\nThe attorney I could just you\nKnow you can do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want but some of them are
