theoretically the trust you would have to negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed because there has to be enough money put into that\nCover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a
