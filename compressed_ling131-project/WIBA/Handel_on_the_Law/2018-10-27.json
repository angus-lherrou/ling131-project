selling the house next spring mhm\nShould we pay on house\nSo soon as soon as the weather breaks you're putting us on the ...\nWell yeah but like for much\nProbably like may or June\nOkay right so like six months plus or minus All right um [noise] okay\nIt doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account instead of pay extra on the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that shows like metal yourself a letter that come June first says if the house is not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a ... vote it wasn't a good plan [laughter] okay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house\nIf um if you're going to keep the ... but for six months it doesn't matter\nThe other part of my question would be at sixty nine thousand currently in a savings account so say we don't so much that America is he would you put towards the mortgage\nHolder emergency fund she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses or that I said you know okay so what would it take if you lost both your jobs or what would it take for you all to pay your bills for a month\nFor a long mhm um eat people I get on it or do you keep the lights on that kinda stuff I'd say three or four thousand OK so\nTo six terms terms four thousand\nSix times four thousand twenty four thousand twenty five thousand of the sixteen ounces most used do okay which leaves you about forty clear okay ... forty five clear um and to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eight thousand okay\nYeah so hold that and and I had to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand dollar count in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house Fonda or paid off ... bond okay if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house\nOkay if you awful and

this that's for sure how can I help\nUm\nNo I was just calling in today 'cause I I've been listening to you for about a year I'm On and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand in cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars here in the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the about eight thousand on mine and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like\nThat got it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one Cornel five one twenty ... a year where did you used to the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before uh before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... Utah was my first day in real estate I've got to choose\nWell you got a big well you've got a big pile of an emergency front and you really sound like you've hit some things and I obviously this was an emotional issue and then the main reason why I mean a lot to you\nAnd sorry to interrupt the reason why I'm nervous because I'm not able to build it back up as bad as it started so it makes me nervous to take a big chunk out don't care how big is the ...\n... about a third so twenty grand other sixty broker or\nWill the emergency fund is there in case there was obviously an emergency capping already this year right so um but but if you think through your single\nA divorce or stuck I have a I have a son already but in any case I re Mary mountain the option to have more children and how old are you\nNine okay All right um\n\n[noise] there's two there's two things that were bumping through my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud to show it was just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency furniture for emergencies\nGuy thing too is this is very very very important\nTo you obviously it it is and uh I mean it's it's\nIn in you have a a window of time you know a show I guess what I'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off there's twenty grand the best most efficient most reasonable most safe\nWay is there a Fifteen grand methodologies are thirty five grand methodology is or other things that I 'cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the obvious to you know the higher level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to ... to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for on the ground I'm going to learn a lot you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me during that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy\nBut my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the ... this is not an emergency we could say that\nFor sure but I feel like I feel like it it\nFeels like it on the line is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury that's very\nVery very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes on might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay 'cause I don't want to catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way that would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean I don't I ... I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nIdeal but they won't cover it\nBecause I don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that would eat up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get the forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it that's a lot and I thought that'd be a million dollar expense ... so it'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process and this way too because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\nOkay I'm In if\nYou want a super emergency upon backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated\nA ... a principal the process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better there's a logical to you\nI think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or pasture or somebody else on you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this in a variety show the what I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know the\nFamily and I are wary about urban crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude account shoulders safety and that's what I'm looking for but\nI don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation thanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener wrote Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina is it Rami roaming\nIts romey high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was recently called called by a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a some insurance products so I'll let you know term insurance and with ability which I agreed with him that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some\nOr some other coach there were a lot better ... and ah and I reached out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah those are those are kind of like letting those insurance companies aren't good their um their their ratings are high financial you want to go with the more higher expensive insurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next\nTwenty years you know we are going to show you know it was like oh okay um so I Need to buy the basic described as the Mercedes of ensuring either by state if you don't want to be in like a Chevy yeah how do I wanted to get your thoughts on that well um\nThat's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\nSo they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nYeah they have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now they go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you got a recipe and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about those progressive have the money to pay my claim you know but you can look at the AM best ratings of someone at Zander insurances website and\nThey are all financially solvent as much as this Google that sell any of the stuff that's a that's a lot of BS rum Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead and went with the the less expensive option anyways it's like well I wouldn't because like I wouldn't do that from my\nFamily ah yeah you know in order to now selling\nInsurance and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they call you that tells you the one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah if you are doing investments with them if you're doing the whole live life insurance with them which we don't recommend so you'd be a lot more about the stability because you have a savings account there then\nThat's a lot more important to be with\nThem like [noise]\nI got split Thompson senior executive producer of

the reasons we're chasing all like because the only problems with ... and early in the entire makes it a hit on a play and and unfortunately uh\nKnow the first contact was it had it was kind of a word play that to you know when he was trying to angle another tech player and the other ... clear cut in front of them in\nAny clip them and and the right call was a major and we've got another family at the time so you don't buy 'em on three and a new one only to use ... for the game get kind of you know put us behind or at least on their heels with them having so much power play time and\nAnd we never got to go on and make say took advantage of ... all we got to be better on the PKK\nUm we got to play more five on five hockey for going to play for winds and we're going to roll over like we did in those first by names that you're talking about\nYou gotta play five on black and uh you know we we never got our game going in to the point we did your game going on in the [noise]\nThe only way to make it for two and a third and things are starting to go our way through the period you know we get a bad break in a caller knew he gets a major penalty wanted to look like\nThey might go the other way we're we're the ones that end the shorthand and that's when the game was over so so it was frustrating for us and it's important for a night to to get back to doing things that you talked about what the speed and energy and and clean at a pace that\nMakes it hard on the were playing against last night and we just weren't able to get to that part of our getting it you\nCan you pinpoint the breakdowns on the penalty kill as much as well\nYou know we actually did a really good jobs and the majority of the ... you know\nAgain and then we'd have one major break down and it would end up Internet so um you know we got a lot of young players on the case\nAll are very good palate killers but they're going to go through some learning curves up so\nI'm getting the experience that they need so do\nThe tech jobs they get you know they they battled the nicer place a\nPort in times of the game late late into our place to have um two of them are just you know it's ... um she'll give them credit and and obviously we have to be better on the PKK a tonight\nHopefully you know he killed three of war you have to kill three or four nights\nYou I I like her chances but when you got to kill you know two majors if I'm On the tree and then four or five other ones where she apparently killers down and it gives knows skilled players on the other team you know so much more time to be on the ice to be able to make those places you're totally\nRight out I was with us Wisconsin and Michigan Tech more in a moment from the American family insurance broadcast booth just as badger hockey from their fields\nWildwood one operator what's your emergency yeah they all lead are clearing ... okay so let the deck of the building it from like ... how did you know he literally will leave he said OK learning so much he's living at it we don't like it\nShow how were you able to come to power play five times last night\nShift things things came together for them you know we were we were spending some time in their interest costs of weeks ago um I think you're getting a question was asked what do you have to our successful twice came to have a successor was go to any professional teams and I think both of those were tremendous and we spent time with them I think we have\nAgain a credit to the recording that they're out there on that um and now we're guys in the right spot that doesn't give you different looks them and and\nThe guys in the right spot and that that's something we didn't have the last couple of years here for the power plays we didn't have the right guys were trying to make something that they naturally weren't and I think we do have a bit of that right now the guys complain that their strength to certain areas and that works so that worked out pretty well last night and\nYou mentioned gold and they had a chance to see measures before last night's game it was good to see me look happy and healthy and I got to know what's bothering 'em well too and I know he felt good about his performance by a sniper shot goes and he said well you got to stop the next one and he did he make twenty five saved that was a pretty good debut for most of\nThe ... that's the right attitude to have as a gold tender you know the last one is there is all it's in the record books that last show as always memory the next one is the only one that matters\nUm and then when I was gone as the next place over here that the right attitude to have the he was made from big staged and then we were fortunate to get gold after he made big save and and build on that a little bit so\nUm if some of those go in which for quality wise back walked in a couple of times um they had a great tour and more on the on the power play in the in the first part of their some of these go in it's a whole different\nBall of wax but you need to have those safe to go and it it makes a difference to the game you're came to play great and and have we'd go hunting and", "year": "2018",
