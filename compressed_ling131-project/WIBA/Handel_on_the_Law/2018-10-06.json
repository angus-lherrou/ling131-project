enough to build their own reputation but I think what he means by that is the strong often supply right getting that these that that strong and just dominating both sides of the line of scrimmage\nAnd that's what made the ... the great in the nineties does what those are the best teams that we've ever had the best teams that we've ever had did that same exact thing\nAnd I'm a Nebraska's got away from it and\nThat's what he's trying to instill back as the ... and ... it's more speaking to the Oscar fans that it is a slight to the badger fans about Wisconsin out Nebraska Nebraska you know that's kind of ... where he was going with that but I mean I I I get it Wisconsin's\nDominated this division ever since we've been a part of it and the Oscars are envious of that and and our fans are envious of that they want that back in Lincoln to where you know they can do that they can show up on Saturday and dominate the line of scrimmage and it just hasn't happened\nMcLaughlin the sideline reporter for Nebraska last thought for you here tonight as you're down to the field watching how this game develops where will you be looking to give you an indication of where it's going\nWell I'll be looking on the field for yellow flags we've we've committed ten penalties at least in every game that we played in so cliche we do these pre game shows and we talk about turnovers we talk about penalties every week but when you're committing over a hundred yards and penalties every week you know I heard you talking earlier about rascals offensive numbers [noise]\nWe're we're in the process of putting a study together of how many of those yards of have been committed after after a fall I Can't tell you how many times it's been third in ten or longer\nAnd we just have to stay in the drive through a penalty I mean at least three or four times in the Colorado game at least three or four times and the Purdue game last week where it's been certain twenty four and you get a holding call and it's a first down they end up scoring on the possession\nOf will be looking for that one thing that we didn't do four years ago on this field when Melvin Gordon had a career day was that the edge I mean if you're not setting the edge against Wisconsin good luck I mean I that that's the big thing\nUh we had a a a backup middle linebacker terrorists ACL and he's out for the year soda brats in the middle of something I mean keep an eye on the other thing we're going to have to do when they had the ball they're going to have to take advantage of the time that they get because with a style that Wisconsin plays a grind it out mentality\nScott ... loved to have the ball but when you don't have the ball you can't score so what happens when a brass got the ball's gonna be huge bend McLaughlin
