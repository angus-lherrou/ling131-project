twenty third Thanksgiving is sneaking up on us it's about a month away\nAnd here in Madison for the past Thirty years a tradition has been that good and community centers Thanksgiving basket Dr John like from the Goodman community center joins me now good morning John point where I'm like you've had meanwhile Thirty years\nYeah it's hard to believe can't believe it hum yea Thirty years ago we were just serve in a a couple of hundred people in our neighborhood and the five three seven four ZIP Code and now we're we're countywide serving thirty five hundred families the Thanksgiving\nAnd this is really a shining example of Madison's a giving reputation as far as uh during the holidays I tell you what this area really shines\nYeah yeah we're are so grateful to the community there is no way that we can serve all these families without a tremendous amount of support in every year um we know that we can count on the community to help make sure that these families go I'm don't go without a Thanksgiving\nWhen times are tough you know and for many times are still time but I'm Talking you know when we're in the recession and it was really a making ends meet on your own ad but it always having a little extra to give to those who are worse off\nYeah I think that there's a there's that sort of culture I think that's why a lot of people enjoy living here you know it's just sort of\nOur monitor that we're looking out for each other and it definitely shines er during the holidays but I think it's it's apparently around as well\nNow you're looking the goal is to serve a thirty five hundred families are totally in about Twenty one thousand Dane County residents and that includes ten thousand adapt to children ah it has has that I'm a golden change has increased over the years or has its uh have you kept that number for a while\nUm that's been a number of the last two or three years I'm it increased dramatically about six or eight to ten years ago or so um the NATO in connection coalition used to a countywide um turkey give away and they were feeding six thousand a thousand families\nDecided to stretch a switch at this to Egypt plan and kind of a dispersed that support more throughout the year and then we picked up the slack and that's where we really jumped up from being a few hundred families to a thousand and then it seemed like every year after that we're doing an extra five hundred and families and so on and we sort of had our capacity in terms of\nUm how much food we can actually store in that short amount of pie that time and then distribute over just a few days and then this thirty five hundred families that that come through our parking lot to pick up their best get 'em so really sort of takes over our Center for a few days you know sort of a sort of our max capacity we think right now\n[noise] yeah and it's really an art form John how ... how you do this drive because you can't take a a pile of food in right now you know on on October twenty third don't run out and give them Turkey's\nYeah yeah that's true that that sort of a tricky thing about it is that we really need the donations to come in but we don't have a place to store until you know a week or so before Thanksgiving\nSo you know we ended up using dropping over a hundred and twenty thousand pounds of food and our gymnasium a week before we sort through all those donations\nWith some generous folks uh ships in alliance trucking to give ... give us some refrigerated and frozen trucks I mean we have semi trucks in our in our parking lot or ... or you know can you picture with three thousand four thousand had like you know begin to now exactly and so we've got a tight a tight window\nI'm really store and distribute all this stuff\nAnd if you're thinking well I you know I can get stuffy or non perishable right now um I I suppose you could but does that kind of get in a way of just your your regular food pantry operation\nUm yes and no we're doing our best to be creative with their storage hum and we do have a food drive coming up at a high V. east or they're going to be helping us I'm a though actually store\nThe donations and bring them to act yeah so that's a nice and I think yeah\nThat that's a great partnership with the stores as far as list and such um it just as this applies for good or\nIt's giving basket drive to right where you can get a list of stuff that still needed right there at the grocery store\nYeah absolutely our food drive weekends going to be the first weekend I'm In November or the uh the the second through the fourth\nUm they will find listeners when it happened well thank you thank you will have a lot of volunteers there to pass out the grocery list so that you can know what we're looking for and you can check out our website it's really simple you can download copies um distributed amongst your friends or family or at your place of worship or your your department office that\nSort of thing and uh you know at the end of the day you just can't go wrong with financial support so right now you know if you're thinking I'm going to be busy with all this that and the other thing going on for a Thanksgiving the kick off to the holiday season you can just write a check right now right yes that is one\nThing that can come in right now uh I guess we can all come in to be honest ... we're not going to say no to ... or ... but ah yeah financial gift early on that early commitment really helps us in our planning process um we end up\nOrdering a lot of this food in bulk and we've been able to

I'll retire whereas I feel like in in in you know this first hand but when you're in your fifties that seems like the time where people really start thinking of\nOf I'm going to as opposed to some\nDay I think so I think people are two things kind of happened people see the need for retirement planning they start ticking down that the days are years\nAnd the government also allows us to do these catch up contributions so people start seeing you know okay I can do more maybe I should do that because someone else is saying I should do that [laughter]\nSo again I think it's that finite time that starts coming to our attention that okay we know how long roughly we're going to live with average life expectancy is\nMaybe I'll go a little longer maybe I'll go a little less and let's face it John people also get sick you know and they see whether it's friends of theirs that are getting sick or you know losing close people close to and then they start really waking up going ... is this really what I wanted to do you know ... is this really how I wanted to spend my life you know\nSo we're still kind of what's the first step than what what should we be doing first there is we're kind of assessing the stuff\nYeah so the first thing I think you should do is if you haven't already figured out how much money you'll need in retirement figure that out look right how much do you need to save to retire at a certain age with a certain amount of income\nSo if you haven't looked at those numbers are had someone help you figure out okay how do I incorporate my state of Wisconsin pension\nGet to someone figure out like who can you go and talk to and a you know I'm happy to help people you know they'll figure it out and it's not hard but you do need to know a few things about how maybe your pensions work\nOr you know obviously Social Security plays a role here and what kind of lifestyle you're thinking that you might need some some of these things can be really like in your mind like oh they're they're almost too big to overcome their not\nIf you get to some someone who knows and can make some good assumptions you can get past the noise and then actually get to some you know decision making like okay this is what I Need to do\nAnd then the next thing to do is to figure out okay what's the best place to say hey you know should I be putting it out pre tax or post tax um should I Do a combination and again you need to revisit these things because of the new tax law right so we've got less tax or the tax rates have gone down\nSo that's awesome and you have to think to yourself now does it still makes sense for me to be doing all pre tax when my taxes are less well maybe I'm at that tipping point where I really should be doing more post tax more maybe a combination\nSo to so revisit that and then the last thing\nI think it should do\nIs to take advantage of those ketchup contributions so you can add more to the four one K. fall through the ... the um and the rise of the state of the same but two thousand Eighteen falling came max it's Eighteen thousand five hundred and the catch catch up at six thousand for those age fifty and over\nSo you can do twenty four thousand five hundred and it might feel difficult like you're thinking to yourself I've got my kids to take care of and now my elderly parents and money is going out here and there\nHow do I how do I do all of this but the reality is is if you can figure out what you need to retire on you know what those income savings and loans have to be in order to reach your goal is\nIt's really a lot of freedom that comes from that but then you can go I guess I can I can take this extra money and put it for the kids' education or I can take this extra money and try to save for a second house or supporter second house or whatever\nTalking with certified financial planner Tracy in town of course she comes to us from de Anton investment ... website released remember T Anton investment ...

that you know you don't it's living today and also saving for tomorrow so it's that balance that you're always trying to create but you're right I mean extra dollars today can make a big difference down the road it's it can be a huge for you\nTalking was certified financial planner Tracy Anton with T Anton investment ... website\nT Anton investment ... dot com you always hear about the you know the first dollar saved us the most powerful and least power for those ones that you ah put away one or two years\nBefore retirement is their truth to that or or what what is it that way I think my whole undergrad education with all the time [laughter] and using my calculator so yes that is very true\nBut the earliest you can put away money you know it'll grow the fastest but that's still no reason not to save in your fifties [laughter]\nIn fact they show that dollars saved in the final decade before retirement can make a huge difference\nAnd the clients eventual retirement resources that create either a higher income in retirement or more assets for discretionary spending right you have more money to spend\nAnd oftentimes if I Know someone's going to retire earlier I'll say hey why don't we put some money in your retail account your brokerage account or get where you're getting capital gains rates and you can access it before fifty nine and a half don't have to worry about that ten percent penalty oh that's a really good idea\nSo again I think that saving even the last decade makes a huge difference say five years can make a big difference\nAnd you know this is really true they say I'm also if your savings rate increases by fifty percent or more in the final five to ten years before retirement oh now that's a lot right on your savings by fifty percent but for some people can do it\nThey have no mortgage or you know something else happened or like you said their income goes up that dramatically and the last ten years before they retire\nAnd we'll talk about the

well if you want to you want to kind of add a little bit more to that nest egg aren't\nThere I think figuring out how to work part time and are in some income when your full time work ends can make a huge difference for people both financially and non financial reasons\nSo some good ideas range from monetize saying a long term passion that you had or working fifty or Seventy percent time at your current job\nOr taking on consulting roles so this extra income may help you take a lesson from your retirement portfolio it also may help you\nUm take less in on our postpone your Social Security so that goes up by ... percent every single you you're you wait until age Seventy so this you know can really be helpful later in life so it's nice to have a lot of people like working ... ...\n... talk about those ... as you were talking about a friend of mine he is not quite retired but he likes to Dr Wilbur part time not because he needs the money he likes to just hang out with the likes driving a truck and\nSo I have another client who I I think I might have thought to the start where he he retired and he said he didn't want to do I think it was a nurse um he didn't want to do that anymore but he ended up driving like an auto parts thing and you just drive across town he says and I you know part\nTime [laughter] and it's good for you is\nYes it is good I mean having that routine can be really helpful so that you got something going on and then you kind of put the fun stuff around it\nSo you know it's interesting when we talk about you know when it comes to working and um you had mentioned people have other reasons for for working and it's not just the dollars and cents is it\nNow I mean there are many benefits to working uh ask clients if they miss working and they usually say no but I miss the people yeah they say I miss the work but not that\nPeople provides things that are really not\nMoney related it can provide a great social outlet if you enjoy that people you work with and if you don't it gets you out of the house so for many of us we like a routine and we'd like putting part time work into the schedule creates that framework of a schedule so part time or it can also give us a sense of accomplishment and feeling like you are needed\nSo working daily might feel like it's too much but hey maybe three days a week is just right for you so you know there's
