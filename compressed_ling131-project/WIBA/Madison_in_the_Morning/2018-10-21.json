{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "Does also in Studio with us this morning as Madison police chief Michael ... good morning Rob thanks so much higher and Chris Hi chief could assume so now you to how long have you to um than friends that I mean you've always travel you go in the same circles of law enforcement being a defense attorney and police chief\nYeah it's interesting because you know I look at cop says officers of the court so I don't have a particular compunction again the defense bar and he has taken on some fairly high prominent high profile cases involving impede the arrest and things\nSo even though one would think that there'd be a natural a chasm as between the two of us I frankly think that that's never been a starter issue for us and in fact\nI'm Molly his daughter has been a galvanizing moment in my professional life and my personal life and\nWith his blessing I haven't been able to share a bit of his journey his family's journey with what it's like dealing with someone who's a under the throes of addiction and then and thanks to him bringing a story that somewhat abstract into a meaningful context with some real personal effects imparted\nIn the letter that he drove I rode his I read his letter to six hundred employees as part of our annual in service it's so moved me because I wanted everyone to embrace the moment and to understand what families are dealing with in through Chris\nAnd his beautiful way of crafting a a letter of inspiration a helped me I think to impart that message consistently and accurately and in a compelling sort of way\nAnd now Chris you wrote this letter was this a ... for the first overdose\nIn any more than ... ... no I got a ... ton of member twenty to twenty fourteen ... which was one week after the\nThe news story about Madison police street sergeants being a clip with three hundred doses and our can which actually was less than three hundred\nBecause they had to use some training um they had maybe a hundred and fifty dollars is on the street and this was a program pushed hard by the chief and other members of the police department because they saw people dying of heroin overdose was before the EMTs could arrive was the injectable\nA narcan so and for people ... a benefit ... is a drug that went administered immediately somebody in an opioid overdose it actually resuscitate some and brings them back to life it's it's amazing\nAs Chris and I are both a practicing Catholics we I call it the Lazarus drug because it brings people who are dead back to life it can be pulse list and not breathing when we recover them\nYou know I'm just curious just a second here how long is there a certain timeframe at imagine like what after\nWell anytime you go pulses non breathing those people that are trained in basic an advanced life support will tell you that the clock is clicking in which is why we have an excellent Madison fire department are responding team in and they have all the bells and whistles\nBut when we look at the analysis of the calls we arrive at the call fifty two percent of the time first\nSo it's about a fifty fifty neck and neck so in those critical seconds is not a minute we can be administering something as basic as ... why the wind that well wouldn't we which is why I started with the test program of just having our field sergeants\nCarrying it and then along came Mali's case and based on the incentivizing this case meant to me I pushed hard so that we could get grant funding so that everybody would have this in their hand\nOut Molly unfortunately was\nThe first Bush she well she was the first sergeant Jeff else first case he had literally been trained in the use of ... can less than a week\nAnd was called to an address where Mollie was found pulses and not breathing administered the drug and gave her a second opportunity he\nDid and and in fact when he found her she he couldn't he could barely detectable pulse and she wasn't breathing and she was blue and the person who's been with her had long since left and the person who submit it from my daughter had called nine one one and and sergeant felt um is he still sergeants he still is okay you don't you're canine okay he um\nHe administered one day's dose of nasal narcan which isn't as potent as as hypothermia as as an injectable time but that's what they had\nAnd that didn't do it then he gave her chest compressions to try to get her heart going 'cause you could get a pulse and then he gave her second dose and that's when she revived\nThat was a long couple of weeks for us and when I finally composed myself and was able to get back to my desk I I immediately sat down and wrote notes to the chief\nUm to sergeant fell to a officer ... came out later that day to collect some evidence that I found that I wanted them to use against my daughter so we could force or into the drug court program which is what we succeeded in doing at that time and also um I think there was kept in a row too as well bottom line was we knew that our daughter was dead\nAnd we knew actually she told us after that she was trying to kill herself and they had brought it back to life and then she ... she resumed the desire to live and so I wrote a letter explaining what we had been through and how much is meant to us and I think in a letter which the chief has in front of them\nI think I told them that that she is a long way from better and she may well go um [laughter] but this gives her a chance to fight on and the chief has taken that the long and short of it is I have learned that the chief has used this story\nNot just with police officers who might themselves say why am I saving this person they are nothing but a junkie and he also used it with city council members who wondered whether we should put a\nYou know put a a an expiration date on on people's ability to use this like once you get three uses you don't get it again I don't know how it could even police chief and I we are\nWe're both devout Catholics and I was a was happy to hear that only because when you share a face you probably can communicate better I'm not putting it on anybody else's faith but but he was able to say to the city council people and so I understand that\nYou can ask me to play got and I have a brother in law who retired as a captain of the trend fire department he said I have the same person three times in twenty four hours once and my my buddy said don't bother and I said it's not my job\nUp next right sometimes you have a water part of our ... our code of conduct Madison police departments you start from the proposition is that all life is sacred to us it it it matters and we won't be thrust in that position and using the impetus of this letter\nI told my officers that I don't care if it's a frequent flyer and you wonder what's the result what's the endgame here where you just going to be doing the exact same thing in a week or a month or a year from now and the point of the matter is\nIt does matter it matters desperately for those who look at this as an opportunity yet another ... that this might be that time\nThat we get the help that the wraparound services kick in that we can put the life behind us and we can still make something of it because everybody we have a victim right but then there's the secondary tertiary levels of\nFamily friends all of those people who are affected by that and this is that pervasive insidious addiction\nThat knows no boundaries in terms of gender or or any kind of\nDiversity land ... and again uh looks you know I'm an\nAddiction doesn't pet\nUgly people pretty people it picks all people as far as what you consider if Isabelle no parents it's\nEverybody and we have a Molly van Wagner here or a\nGorgeous young woman came from an upscale home\nThank you for as a woman saying that because I I'd be accused of being sexist I mean this\nYoung woman if not for you saying that I Would say this is a poster child\nFor success and what matters in it\nShe had everything she had the look she had the personality she had the caring and caused compassion the right credentials the right family and and it said that sort of level that even when you have all the institutional foot holes and safety net\nIt knows no boundaries that knows no etiquette it can just cut to the chase it any family dynamic\n... you know it Robin in from Nineteen eighty three to Nineteen eighty seven I was an assistant da in my home town of Trenton New Jersey and the number one drug we dealt with was heroine but it was a very different heroin it was very week\nIt was as they used to say a lot of beat bags a lot of water down stuff\nIt came down on the train from New York and in wax paper on bulbs classy novel ups and and that was the old school view of heroin other heroin has a long history and it has\nIts roots in part in the New York\nJazz scene and the art scene it was always considered to be a drug that allows you to explore you artistic side but the the heroine of today and the chief certainly knows more about this and I do but the heroine of today that I Know about\nIt sold by people who are cooks and workers in restaurants they party and they snort it and the heroin today is far more potent it's far less expensive and it and and it often starts with snorting 'cause a lot of people are afraid of needles I have a theory on that I'm gonna come back to in a minute but but if you're at a party where people are\nUsing some kind of powder or other and they're drinking and they're having a good time somebody says try this there's no question that the high from heroine has what people describe as\nAn astonishingly uh enjoyable high\nBut it also has a you know it's been said about crack they said about this about that but heroin has always been the single most addictive hardest to get off of drugs\nAnd people go back to it after years not using it they can't help but they remember it and they use it and they're right back on it so you can get addicted rather quickly and the minute you started injecting you are addicted because it's going right into your bloodstream but the people who are using it look like", "show_name": "Madison in the Morning", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "21"}
