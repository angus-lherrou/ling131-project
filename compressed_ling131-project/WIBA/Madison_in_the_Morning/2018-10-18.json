for this Monday morning Sunday night we don't know the nine one one call came in around nine or what I Am Monday and based on that as well as evidence\nOf out of the home they believe that Jamie was inside the home at the time she's gone ads now consider critically missing they believe somebody took her\n[noise] yeah and as far as any indication if they believe someone in the area or are these

in on the scary fine here in the eye our radio original vision Halloween radio commercial free Halloween hit that are both wind and scary [laughter] both picked that perfect Halloween costume candy\n[noise] it is so we feel blessed that we get to help people plan to retire successfully and there's a lot that goes into that for anybody who's been listening to the show for a while it's incredible the number of topics\nThat you get involved and it's one of the reasons why we consider ourselves in the niche of retirement planning because it allows us to go narrow in deep into the topic of what impacts people's lives in retirement\nPart of that retirement that we actually probably don't talk enough about on this show is the fact that we're mortal\nSo hope this doesn't come as a surprise anybody\nMatter of fact this kind of fascinating when I was younger I used to play soccer and I traveled quite a bit\nAnd as I traveled around the world I recognize that there was there were a lot of differences between other countries the United states but one of the big ones was that people were much more willing to talk about\nDeath and kind of face and what happens\nAnd certainly there's a lot of you know disagreements amongst people about a face and and what happens after we die but it was just part of the conversation as I traveled around the world whereas here in the United states\nI think we've almost reached a certain level a standard of living that we think we're beyond this right I'm beyond talking about that and I go really\nCause last I checked death rates are still hovering around a hundred percent right and so I Do think it's important when we talk about retirement planning whether you're a person of faith or not to say there is a reality that I Will die so you have to deal with that spiritually\nBut you have to deal with that financially because if you don't\nHere's the good news the state of Wisconsin has pre written they will for you the problem is it just doesn't say what you want it to and the other good news is if you hire people like us we will help\nYou figure that out the problem is we get to see the bomb that goes off in people's lives you know imagine dealing with the emotion of a family member's death also coupled with the fact that they didn't identify anything they wanted to have happen and so throughout our lives we accumulate\nThings and as we accumulate those things we have to be aware that it is in ... whether it's in our twenties fifties eighties or nineties it as inevitable that we will die and so we have to figure out figure out the disposition of those assets\nSo some fun facts according to the center for Disease Control and prevention which looked at life expectancy for the U.S population and twenty sixteen\nThe average expectancy for for every American was Seventy eight point six years\nFor males the life expectancy and twenty sixteen was Seventy six point one and for females the life expectancy was eighty one point one another interesting fact is that in twenty Seventeen about two point seven million people died in the United states\nSo one thing I Will mention is that we actually just in our office uh this we have about Thirteen hundred house we work with them so it's not uncommon for us to deal with deaths of our clients especially since we're doing retirement planning but it is less common for us to deal with somebody in their thirties and forties who dies so we had a client who started working with us just a few months ago\nCalled us about two weeks ago and let us know that he had pancreatic cancer and he just died on Monday and it happened in in the blink of an eye he had no history of it\nNo health problems just a few months ago when we met him and it jumped on him overnight and so it's a it was reminded everybody in our office that we just don't know when our time is coming\nAnd talking with sea Jake loss and Janelle ... of class financial their website clots

important part of of all of this which is where's the money going to come from how do we do\nThis [noise] yes so as a as a transition to paying for it Janelle and I met you know yesterday and we're like how are we going to live up the topic a little bit because how do you live in a topic about death [noise]\nAh well I don't know you'll have to judge us there after and tell us how you think we did um but yes how do we pay for the funeral so getting a little bit more into the weeds now hopefully we've made a case for why you need to plan whether it be for minor children or for just having the piece\nThat your family can focus on the things that matter instead of the chaos that ensues when you don't have your own plans in place\nBut this question still comes Janelle just mentioned that costs eighty seven hundred dollars for a traditional burial about another six thousand for your average cremation with some burial of the of the remains and then she said by the year twenty thirty five almost eighty percent or we ... it will be ... how do we pay for this stuff\nWell a there's a few different ways some people just have a joint checking her savings account that set aside and kind of earmarked for this there can be risk to that by the way if you end up you know putting ten grand into a checking her savings account that earmarked for that and you never touch it almost like a like a real estate tax fund right\nThe problem can be if you end up in a nursing home that can get spent down to zero right but that is one option just set aside money for it and just tell your kids is that money is for even put it in your will\nUm you can uh you can some some people end up doing a whole life insurance policy so they call 'em actual actually final expense life insurance policies\nAnd to be quite Frank this is probably while while we don't love having to use insurance based products for anything they are useful in certain areas and we would say this is one of our more\nA favorite uses of life insurance is to have a final expense life insurance policy because then usually that can go towards any a funeral home it's got quite a bit of flexibility to it it gives you a defined a death benefit\nIt's not exactly a great quote unquote investment but it gets it gets the money outside of your state so if you end up in a nursing home and you end up with no dollars that money will still be there for the burial\nAnd then there are there are also separate trust that can be set up for this funeral homes will have these trust 'em funeral home like um associations will have the stress where you can put money into the trust and then that trust has the assets available again outside of your state for\nFor payment to various funeral homes across the country\nAnd finally you can just do a prepaid funeral expense where you can go to a funeral home and say hey we know we want to do the service with you\nWe know that you're associated with X Y Z burial plots we want to buy a plot through you and you can just do that all through that funeral homes again that can have some risk of that funeral home isn't in business by the time you end up passing away so there's some risk risks and each of these approaches\nAre comment would be talk to your financial advisor they should give you some guidance\nAnd talk to a funeral home director that you trust and try to come up with a plan for how you're gonna either prepay for this or have money set aside to pay for it upon death\n... is not here today but she did send over notes and I think the last couple of
