particular investment grow and then in packed my taxes in the future [noise] so we're going to start talking about capital gains versus ordinary income taxes\nThere's quite a bit of confusion around us so first let's understand what is a capital gains tax\nSo think about your retirement accounts your ... your ... year Roth IRA growth on those are not capital gains tax guy so just kind of in your mind wiped those out that's not what we're talking about right now\nWhat we're focusing on is your other stuff right so you buy a\nHome you you put money into adjoining account between you and your spouse and individual after tax account so we call this after tax money because you pay tax on it and then you went and invested that money by the way don't confuse us with Ross\nRoss money's after tax contributed but it grows tax free that's not what we're talking about this is just pure after tax money\nSo with after tax accounts the growth is the either dividends interest or capital gains and actually those earnings of dividends interest and capital gains are sent to you in ten Ninety nine formed ten Ninety Ninety ivy ten Ninety nine I N T capital gains are inexperienced until you sell a position\nAnd so those taxes can impact you so are are the growth can impact in different ways interest is typically tax that ordinary income tax rates\nBut dividends and capital gains are taxed at preferential tax rates\nIf you've held them for at least a year so they're known as short term capital gains or long term capital gains if you've held it for less than a year than any growth on that position would be tax as ordinary income [noise] and he's held it for over a year it could be taxed at a preferential rate so first\nLet's understand what I'm what I'm Talking about here so income tax brackets now there are seven brackets for ordinary income taxes there's ten percent twelve percent twenty to twenty four thirty to thirty five and thirty seven [noise]\nHowever long term capital gains taxes are I said preferential and there's really only three rates that could apply the zero percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent and by the way there's some confusion around this cause people think oh that's what changed with this tax bill that's not true\nFor the twenty Eighteenth tax here at zero Fifteen and twenty which is the same as what it was for twenty Seventeen okay okay so the rates are the same\nWhat has changed is the threshold for when you pay that rate so if you're married filing jointly you will pay zero percent long term capital gains up to Seventy seven thousand two hundred of household income or if you're single thirty eight thousand six hundred [noise]\nIf you're married filing joint you'll pay Fifteen Percent long term capital gains up to four hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars of taxable income or for twenty five if you're single\nAnd finally if you're married you'll pay married filing jointly you'll pay twenty percent if your total income is over four hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars in a year\nSo set another way if you hold after tax investments and they are crude dividends or a ... it's a qualified dividends or long term capital gains\nAnd and your income is below some of those pretty high threshold you will pay a lower overall tax rate than you would if it was ordinary income taxable\nTalking with the ... last

Social Security income can be ordinary income taxable [noise]\nThis is where things start to get confusing for people well CJ at what rate right and that's it that's where it's really confusing capital gains tax rates are based upon household income\nAnd then we have ordinary income tax rates that are based upon again that household income equation so but it's again those seven brackets ten up to what was it thirty seven percent or the brackets based upon the accumulation of that income\nThere's also marginal income taxes to be understood so some people think that if you are in one more dollar over the bracket then all of your money gets taxed at a higher rate which is actually not true\nUh the taxes are bracket it and so it's a there's a marginal effect that goes into that [laughter]\nFinally we get to this place of well see ... what does this mean when I turned Seventy and a half and I start having required minimum distributions here we go more taxation it's true don't ask me why the government did this they just wanted to force your money out of your pre tax retirement account I'm just the ... the messenger don't shoot me [noise]\nUm uh but ... it's this distribution from from pre tax retirement account at Seventy and a half and then through the rest of your life you have to take these minimum distributions those are taxed\nAs ordinary income okay but the government is actually given eyes that million I think are really great opportunity that you can currently donate your required minimum distributions up to a hundred thousand dollars per person or two hundred thousand you know per couple every year\nTo a charity and avoid the taxes paid and the charity by the way when they receive the money pay nothing Oh nice right so if I have an R. M. D. I can give it directly now this is key it's probably best if you give it direct silly because if you take it out and you pay income taxes\nAnd then you give the donation to the charity you actually then have to itemize your taxes to get that benefit and with standard deductions having being raised you might not get a benefit from that\nSource suggestion is talk to your financial advisor your investment advisor and maybe consider changing your charitable contributions if you're over seven and a half two I die a direct are indeed distribution to that charity\nGreat advice as always CJ closet ... come to us from claws financial don't forget about their website plus financial dot com that's K.
