{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "You it's pleasure to have you with us this morning and uh and taking the time 'cause I Know it has been a hectic couple of months\nOr for middle ... as well as emergency personnel firefighters with a historic flooding that we saw in late August and then a needless to say just a couple of weeks ago a few weeks ago that workplace shooting how's the how's the department doing since it's been a few weeks now\n[noise] yeah well thanks for asking about that and that's um\nObviously kind of where I'm focused right now and then uh uh but I Do we do need to think about our community about the employees of WTO's paradigm because I'm\nObviously those employees went through a heck of a day I Can't fathom I really I Can't really either and and so there are long term recovery is ongoing but you know I I hear things from members of our community also and I think\nThat um you know you'd be silly to think that nothing could ever happen in your community in general but I think you know we live in a pretty safe area the upper Midwest Wisconsin a Dane County\nIn while nobody would ever say oh I Can't happen here um I ... I think people were surprised that it happened here and I think people's sense of security has obviously been um tested by that but but back to your original question um [noise]\nYou know we're doing well um the officers that um [noise] went into the building a it was a very traumatic scary um [noise]\nAn event for them in a ton of responsibility on them and really short period of time and um so it affected them but you know what I'm Amazed that is out affected uh people in our organization that weren't even there\nUm who's a who maybe got caught and later or ... you know work the night shift so that they were sleeping that day and surprisingly guilt you know like oh I should have been there um so\nUm I think our spouses I'm a significant others are affected by this are civilian staff absolutely are dispatchers or the dispatchers that are on the phone and and hearing shots ringing in the background and talking to people that are hiding under deaths and yet\nThey can't do anything you know at least cats can go in and do something affirmative dispatchers you know they keep us safe they tell us what's going on and they did a fantastic job that they both in the middle ... police dispatch center and the county ...\nAnd when one center but um [noise] ... you know we don't want to forget them either\nNo they're the first line of communication absolutely\nThey keep us safe and they're the ones that are getting as dramatic calls from people and um\nSo it you know it was a um obviously a traumatic experience for them I Will tell you that in our profession I think we've gotten a lot better at I'm understanding that uh how trauma affects us and dealing with it\nSo used to be the old tough guy and of course you know police and used to be a an a man's profession or not that case anymore but you know as tough it out buck up get back in a ... you know\nYeah like I Want to hear the yarn shot so right now you know you're alive you handle it at\nYour heroes you know go to work um but now even I mean in the police academy they recognize that I'm\n... and um we we do um things with our families so that they understand what stressors police officers go through not just in something like this but every day I'm so that uh we understand was stressors we put our families through\n'em and then in this case you know as soon as we could we got those involved shooters out of there not just the officers that shot but the the injury teams we paired them up with buddy officers right away we um activated our peer support\nWe have a trauma psychologists in a pie you know I'm contracts with with different providers so we got them going right away\nThe BPA which is Wisconsin professional Police Association sent people out right away not only attorneys to represent the police officers but just staff to help the police officers um get through this and we've had the briefings we've had to briefings with the\nInvolved officers with the entry teams just with our staff you know both police than civilian and even like I say are significant others um we've tried to provide services for them and so on so it's something that we're trying to get ahead of it with things that I was thinking of 'em right back at the command post that day\nUm how to get our folks out of there and what we're going to do long term to\nTo um help them and protect them and get past this so I'm we're doing that I Know I'm\nThe I'm I'm\nEmployers are WTO's paradigm are are equally as concerned about their employees I been almost in constant contact with the number of their people and they're trying to ease their folks back into you know the work environment and um are also using trained professionals to\nTo guide them on what's the best way to do that and you know the thing is people react to this in different ways and and some people are that stereotypical yeah a big deal I'm ... you know back to work the next day and other people\nAre affected 'em and and things will um remind them of this at different times and in different places you know they'll see or hear something perhaps that will remind them of that event and\nI'm so there is no normal way to deal with trauma and that's one of the things we want to get across to that every every emotion that people are feeling is normal and it's good and what's not good is to\nYou know a suppress it um so we want people to talk about it we want people to get help if they need help and um\nAnd it might not be a media he'd had exactly that's a really good point when you look at the TST um there are things that\nUm that pop up um\nWeeks months years later I Know that probably one of the most impactful trainings I ever went to was a Madison police officers that were involved in the red caboose\n... case a daddy daycare down on ... street actually that was that you had time to get ... ten or eleven years ago at the at the longer\nAnd you know I mean man they did everything right and they were heros they say if kids they say you know\nUm teachers but they use deadly force and I'm One officer in particular who's not quite open about it I'm Down the road started suffering from Pete TST and it affected his work and affected his family as friends and now he goes out and tell us police officers about that normalize that again\nSo that we know um that that\nThat's something that could affect us and um\nAnd it really I think helped or locally or police officials and police officers and police families realize that um you know things like this will affect us even like in this case I I think\nYou know the officers did everything right there's no second guessing I mean I cannot imagine the stressors if you know a police officer and made a mistake or shot somebody by accident or you know a deadly force situation those controversial this one's not even controversial and yet it's had a huge dramatic effect on people\nWell as a human being you realize you took another human life and I can't imagine that's an easy even though you saved others in the process by doing that are still you ... yeah yeah\nNo good point and and I think um that makes me proud that we have people working for us that knew what they had to do and did it and yet as you say you know that's the ultimate responsibility that we have and we do not take it lightly and so even in a case like this um\n[noise] people are affected by it as they should be\nAnd so now every time you use deadly force now is that center is still under review by the department of justice um you know because people listen you might think well this is a closed can mean my God this was you know an active shooter of course you're going to fatally shooting ... percent\nWhy do you have to have this revealed that he can answer that\nYeah so um it is under um it falls under the officer involved shooting a result in death protocols\nAnd uh by state law we need a third party to investigate that in both the Dane County sheriff's department who had to deputies involved in this and our department are um agency of choice for an investigation of that type is um the CIA division of criminal investigation which is part of the department of justice\nAnd there I Would say there are the primary um investigation of ... shootings in the state not exclusive but primary so you know what they have to handle this case like they have to handle the controversy on ones they they have to do it the same way the district attorney has to do at the same way\nUm they can't take shortcuts and they are a very thorough professional agency and um it could take a month or six weeks before they complete their investigation and get it to the district attorney's office\nAnd because of that and in some ways that while they have been really good at briefing me um you know every couple of days maybe once a week\nUm there are things about the the ... the investigation that I won't know until after the da clears the officers which I assume the d._a. well\nAre they on at the two middle ... on at and then leave until that happens\nThey are as are the sheriff's deputies and that's just the standard procedure I'm In a you know and it's we stress that that's not a suspension is not a you know it's administrative um\nLeave with pay but yes they cannot work until a ... a couple of things have to happen the main one is that the district attorney um looks at the case in and says that they acted legally unlawfully\nAnd then um you know they have we have our own internal um\nThings that we review and they have to go to Tom a psychologist and get cleared to come back to work and and things like that but they will be off work until then\nHave they expressed interest in they want to get right back on it or maybe you have the other end of it that yeah no I don't not us again\nNo I Am so I I I don't know much about the deputies but I suspect it's the same thing they're anxious to get back to work and um they understand the the process but um yeah it's hard to sit around for a month or month and a half I'm waiting to get that a clearance yeah", "show_name": "Madison in the Morning", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "07"}
