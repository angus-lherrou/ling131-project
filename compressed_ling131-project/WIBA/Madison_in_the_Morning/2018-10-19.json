on this Friday October nineteenth the juvenile justice system this week uh getting some scrutiny\nAs a rash of crime involving youth or specifically the auto thefts that showed no signs of letting up here in the Madison area on the line with me this morning juvenile court administrators John bomb in the morning John\nGood morning Robin thanks for joining me a you know John I think a lot of us including myself don't really know what goes on behind the scenes or what the whole juvenile detention reception center ... is really all about 'em so let's say I'm a Thirteen year old son who who just stole a car I'm arrested\nWhat's the process of my automatically take into ...\nSure a if a juvenile who is ten through sixteen years old is arrested on a state charge and that doesn't include citations or ordinance violations law enforcement if they arrest them or have discretion as to what to do if they don't release that used to a parent or somebody else\nThey then would deliver though that youth to the juvenile reception center which is in the city county building\nAnd my intake staff then go through a process where they interview the officer and parents and youth than anyone else working with that ah that you didn't make a determination on what's appropriate for temporary physical custody and that\nCould be placement in detention that could be placement at our shelter home that could be placement back at home\nIf we take custody of that youth that youth and the next day the next business day\nHas what's called a temporary a physical custody hearing\nAnd that hearing his in front of a court commissioner who then makes a determination based on input from attorneys from social workers a and from others parents victims and they use A Guided by statute or they make that decision on what should happen temporarily with that youth where they should reside\nWho should be monitoring them other conditions that might be necessary to protect the community as well as meet the needs for placement and services that youth temporarily until there's a hearing in front of a judge\nThat statute to allow for let's say this is a repeat offender or a kid that they've seen time and again and it does that a statute allow them to be temporarily taken up to Lincoln house\nNo no Lincoln Hills is a disposition alternatives so once the case is finalized a judge could order Lincoln Hills or a correctional placement that is a they could also word or a group home a foster home or a replacement back at home with a an array of services\nSo that's really a disposition alternative the very front end is related to custody and that's just a temporary physical a custody placement and services to uh to meet those needs\nTo have a I imagine you'd have some cases where where parents can they you know right away they get involved in say put them in detention\nYeah we have many parents who are frustrated with their youth and would like they used to be in detention even though the statutory criteria hasn't been met for detention so um that that certainly happens at at times\nAin't can you just have to repeat what the statutory criteria for putting them in detention has to be\nSure the primary one is that there needs to be I'm a ... first at intake and then at the custody hearing a substantial risk of physical harm to another person is that youth is not held in a secure environment that's the primary uh criteria that's used in in these situations\n[noise] um we've put what I guess you're you're not a judge but um I guess could one or a surmise that you could be putting out others at risk if you're stealing cars and driving like a madman down the road\nCertainly certainly and and at intake we do have a policy that directs my staff to hold those use if they are driving a especially if they're an unlicensed on train driver a because that is inherently dangerous that is our intake decision and less as the supervisor I grant an exception\nThat's a mandate on staff they don't have that custody her in the next day and a lot more input is a provided to the court to them make the next decision on what should happen from there\nIt well what's the attitude and these offenders ... some of them that you're seeing now overall is that a I'm Sorry or are they flipping to ingest whether\nIt's a mixture of both it it really depends on the youth there are some especially now that are I'm realizing that some of the choices they've been making are not in their best interest as this morning we have Eighteen youth and our juvenile detention which is in the city county building so\nSo is that like a little Julie jail didn't have a little do they have bars in the south and\nEverything is secure so they certainly can't can't get out and they have rooms that there are there in when they're in the room so they're locked but there's also a ...\nBut on the call women's hockey stick to know to start the year subway Princeton at labonte arena at seven o'clock

I. B. A. as preparations are underway for another flu season we are joined in Studio this morning by Brenda ... she is an infection prevention specialist\nBrenda how you doing today I'm doing great how are you doing real well great to see you and last year I think most of us remember it was a bad bad year well\nYes it was one of the worst years that we've seen\nUm yeah we had a lot of illness I'm I'm more than a thousand people died from the flu\nIt was a long season to um you know usually flu comes in ... you know in the Wisconsin area we start seeing it in January February we started seeing it before Christmas oh yeah and it went all the way through made last year it was a long time lapse of illness out\nThere do we know what happened was that something was the vaccine last season or what was going on there\nWell last year the vaccine was not a good map okay um and what and when you can explain that to understand what I mean by that\nSo I'm In January each year that World Health organization\nMakes its best gas for the circulating strains of vaccine that are going to be coming to us the next flu year and um and so they they make their best guess down what they think is going to be happening and sometimes there is a mess that the ... the circulating virus doesn't match the vaccine and that's what happened last\nYear it was still ... forty percent effective it was great\nRight so the vaccine there's two different kinds of vaccine there's a try veil and and there's a quandary valence so the ... has three strains of vaccine in the ... has four strings of vaccine so it can be effective against some of the strains it just wasn't effective against all the strains\nDo you sometimes worry Brenda that when people here that they they think oh that's why if it's not if it's not fifty percent why bother 'em do people sometimes have a misunderstanding of of kind of that herd immunity and how getting vaccines helps\nRate um you're you're exactly right um so and herd immunity that means if if many of us get vaccinated we can protect protect those who didn't get vaccinated or who might not be effective against 'em there's some people who can't get vaccinated in the community and so we want to make sure that we're protecting them as well\nVery good talking with Brenda ... she is an infection prevention specialist with SSI mouth of course flu season you never know when it's going to strike never too early to be prepared and get your flu vaccine let's talk about kind of what we're looking at this year Brenda for ah for this flu season\n[noise] well I'm ... right now it's a little early to predict when we don't know when it's going to hit 'em so we we really recommend that everybody started getting thinking about getting the vaccine if you haven't gotten it Tobar is the best time to get the vaccine\nUm it does take about two weeks for the vaccine to become effective so it takes two weeks to your body to build up those immunity so that is fully effective for you\nIs is with the way we talk a little bit about kind of a season I think a lot of people assume that it's it's the weather's season that causes it is it is it that or is it that we're just spending more time in rooms with people because it's so darn cold side\nUm some of that is true however if you think back to even age when Enron when that hit back an own nine that actually hit in ... I'm April and may and then we saw over the summer so traditionally here in the northern hemisphere our flu season is more in the winter months\nAnd yes I think there's something to be said that yeah we're all confined more you're sharing more germs more space um but it can it can hit it any time\nTalking with Brian to claim she is an infection prevention specialist with asked us some help of course getting you ready for ... a flu season is Brenda mentioned it is October in his prime time to get vaccinated and keep yourself and your family safe and dumb burned a one of the one of the statistics I saw in the notes about when it comes to the season\nUm there was there were a a study on a pediatric vaccinations\nWas significantly reduced a child's a risk of death from influenza\nYes um it's estimated that um it it can really reduce the severity of the illness um in our pediatric population I believe last year it was I think it was a hundred and eighty children died of influenza 'em and you know most of the time influenza affects the elderly\nAnd for some reason that doesn't seem to bother people when the elderly get influence I think people expect that but when it happens to children then it becomes much more real\nVery very interesting addict I think I think you're right with the yeah when you start hearing about children people start really kind of getting worked out but obviously the flu vaccine and prevention key for everybody let's talk Brenda about kind of how that flu virus works in in a lot of people say I had a vaccine the last year or two years ago I should be fine that's not true why is\nThat it's not true because what we're talking about earlier with the different viruses that are out there each year there are different strains of vaccine there can be a shift a drift or a shift in the end of that are in the\nStrains of influenza that are out there so each year the flu vaccine contains different strains of virus so even though you might have had that vaccine a year ago it might not have the same strains in it that um this year's vaccine has\nProtect your family of course protect others as well and not run too we talked about the vaccine which is the easiest way one of the easiest ways\nTo to prevent yourself and others from getting sick there are other things you can do as a long way this has not be in and play sub along with are getting the vaccine to to avoid spreading the ... the flu let's talk about some of those some of those things people need to be doing\nSure um first of all if you're ill you need to stay home yes [laughter]\nAnd um I always think that um the flu season starts in Wisconsin typically ask after the holidays in January because during the holiday season we spread so many germs\nUm and because you see your family that that maybe that part of your family only once a year around the holidays you really want to go and see 'em and visit them\nBut if you're ill you shouldn't be going there 'cause you're likely going to spend all that illness to everybody else\nUm and um other things um simple things that we teach our preschoolers I'm covering your cough when he sees wash your hands frequently um those are things that you know we try to teach pre schoolers in sometimes has a toll\nWe forget about doing that avoid touching your eyes you know as your mouth that's where the influenza viruses gonna come into your body um if you're in a hot if you're visiting a health care facility as a patient and you're having signs of influenza\nLikely they're going to ask you to wear a mask and you're going to see your health care providers wearing masks that's the way that we can prevent the spread of transmission um when you're in those facilities\nUm you know even on airplanes I see people now wearing masks more often on airplanes because you know you're breathing that era as everybody else on an airplane and those people around you and so\nI you know I Know I always feel a little ill after coming on coal mining from an airplane flight I'm so people are wearing masks more frequently as well and they just having good health habits\nUm you know making sure you're getting plenty of ras I'm an active and drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthy foods those things always help preventing any illness or you know\nGreat advice talking with Ron Klain she has an infection prevention specialist with S. S. A. S. S. I. M. health and breeding you mentioned you know washing your hands do um most of us carry around especially if you've got little ones um the the alcohol based the Hanson says do those do those work those those works\nThose work against most by most um bacteria\nAnd viruses there was a few things that doesn't work again and those are more ... more diarrhea base and illnesses but against influenza and other things yes\nSo that the hand sanitizers do work and they are helpful and it's great because it's convenient and you you know you don't need to\nBe near a sink with soap and water also when you wash your hands with soap and water one of those other things we teaching teach preschoolers as to sing a song when they wash their hands because we're supposed to wash our hands for twenty seconds and soap and water\nMost of us that if they do wash their hands most people are not washing for twenty second\nIs it row row row your boat I feel like I've I've heard that around [laughter]\nAll different sizes different\nSongs they teach them that you know um and I mean it's a fact of because the little kids do it and they do it very well but we tend to forget about that when we grow\nOn when I tell fortunately we can learn something from those ghettos that is for sure Brenda claimed with as us some help thank you so much for your time you have a fantastic week YouTube
