fungus especially in all those what what grade do about that\nNot much um I Know the thing with ... ... if you're getting mushrooms and you've got what blind people don't realize as most of the\nFungus to make mushrooms are actually good for the plants and without like you know sterilizing in your yard to where nothing will grow in it there's really not much you can do to prevent you know fungus from growing it's going to be really noticeable and you're like this where it's really wet\nYeah I there's that that scattershot thing that I see in March every once in a while and it like shoot things it shoots the spores that your house and they stick\nSo that's kind of annoying if you have like color citing the really difficult to get off but\nThey're just breaking down decaying matter and the spores are in the air\nFlight Matt sat unless you sterilized your yard there's not a whole lot you can do to get to keep them from coming just when you see 'em you know just kick them out if they're in your line or if they're in your mouth just take a flat shovel and flip it over for stirring up yeah stirred up a little bit they're not really doing much harm\nOr where it usually where my family are in the in the lawn under the ground which is the real part of the mushrooms and what you see is just the fruiting body\nUm but where where that is to progress is usually actually greener and those spots because the mushrooms actually break things down and uh you know provide nutrients to the to the grass and the plants\nOkay Rick thanks for the call so yeah so you know it's not really causing any damage or is it is well you mentioned the stuff like out in the yard like under grad says that office side to that maybe there was there's like a\nTree roots other I think when you see a fairy ring you know sometimes you'll see him in a circle there's probably ages ago a tree that was there so it's sort of coming up early conditions are right\nAnd this years in in ... you pointed out what the weather I mean they've been ah we've had quite a few of them out in the back yard ... where are these things coming from is like you know for\nA couple of weeks ago I texted
