and Iowa they're getting to Wisconsin and partly we don't really know yet how many errors or in these you know what happens is people will get them\nThey will maybe leave him on the kitchen table for a few days they'll send them back and that you know when they send them back and it gets to the wrong clerk's office that's when we find out about it\nFor 'em in the case you know it was to meet

so this doesn't seem like it now this group this third party group is called Center for voter information they say there are a nonpartisan organization just working to encourage people to vote\n'em that's all fine and well but you you hear reports like this and you wonder if somebody purposely trying to dupe voters and what you just mentioned there that seems like that could be a logical air\nYeah I we don't usually the air's that we find um with with all of these types of mailers are you know people are trying to do the right thing um but you know sometimes with technology is doesn't know it was do we think it's going to do I mean we're not immune to that problem either\nAnd I'm you know it uh it just there's a mistake made and they're not trying to get people not to vote they

it's it's more trouble than it's worth I think it's I think it's just important for people to have the um have the knowledge that um that their municipal clerk's office\nOr or my boat Wisconsin

I. B. A. and we are joined in Studio this morning by a familiar face Dr ... and ... of after some el Doctorow how you doing this morning I'm\nDoing wonderful great to the back how are you\nI'm doing great to see you and we're going to be talking about the science behind pain and we've had you on ... you're on the line with love having who you're one of our favorite guests on holidays [laughter] um but for people who may have missed some of the previous programs um you have a a unique perspective you not only a when we talk a lot about\nYou know neurological and brain issues but also pain management or you're certified in both aren't you\nYou got it at that a lot of schools [laughter] letting my Internet out and you could probably calculate how old I Am as well but I have my devil board certification does in neurology as well as pain management\nVery cool in one of the things I was surprised when I was looking at the notes and and it turns out that the pain is one of the more common reasons people see a emergency or seek medical attention so let's talk a little bit of mount um you know it's it's I think it's interesting I think probably a you would agree is [laughter]\nIt's kinda hard to define so let's talk a little bit about what the definition of pain is and and and from a medical perspective and from your perspective what it is we're talking about\nThat that's a great starting point I think and when we think about pain we think at least in the medical world that up to one third or more doctor visits ER visits the reason we call her doctor is because of pain\nIt can be back pain had pain chest pain you name it but just generally speaking pain that leads to the second question which is how do we define pain greatly on the line it's so individually and so personally how I define it will be different than how you define it\nIf we look at the true definition from the international association of this study of pain they defined it as an unpleasant sensory an emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage describe in terms of that damage you know the most important thing here I think\nIs that it's sensory as well as emotional and what's not so many things in medicine we just to find is that\nA physiologic component okay your heart rate increases there may not be an emotional component with that but with pain you can't deny there's that physical as well as the emotional component\nIs and you mentioned is is you do is you brought that up kind of popped in my two things are ... you know when it comes to like blood pressure heart rate those are measurable there's there's quantifiable you can say OK here's where your\nPain we don't I Know you guys have the little ... we're not how ...\nHow are you facing as all the way to Grimm missing faith you're absolutely right our science and technology is not there yet hopefully one day we'll have a system just like an EKG where we can hook you up and say wow this person\nTruly is an X amount of pain but we're not that sophisticated yet so for now really we doctors some of us to find pain is whatever the patient whatever you describe it as because I can have a broken arm you can have a broken arm but we can go to experience that very differently\nOn my wife has red hair and she claims genetically that it is worse for is there some\nScience to back that actually how maybe red heads a process and their sensory ability to even take certain medications certain anesthetics and so I've had a number of anesthesia colleagues that safe we know somebody is a red head we may use certain anesthetics versus not so there is some science behind\n[laughter] she's gonna here this is your doctor ... way way with are always right right exactly exactly starting with Dr ...\nTalking about the science behind pain and Dr when you when you talk a little bit about are the kind of the standard definition it it it's interesting because um it's it's a it's a very detailed and complex explanation but but it's also it does is it almost seems like an oxymoron but if you saw a little vague as well as surrounding of a a real simple way to\nKind of is they would say late on a dock what exactly\nHow do we break this down um and so like we were saying there's the scientific definition and I can go on and on about the receptors and will touch on that and the\nBusy a lot physiology behind why we feel that but at the end of the day you have to be conscious you have to have literally a brain to feel that pain you can't just be\nA nerve firing and that chemical response happening so you need both you need both the physiologic response as well as the emotional mental capacity to understand what pain is to truly feel well\nWe defined as paint today\nSo we'll talk about what's kinda going on in our bodies in kind of breaking that down as far as what exactly is going on when someone feels pain\nExcellent question so there's different types of receptors in our body and just to keep it simple we have of course different receptors that will then feel painful stimuli versus non painful stimuli\nSo if you think of just feeling pressure so if I were to come up behind you give you a nice shoulder rub you'd say wow I feel that pressure to those receptors or firing saying okay this is pressure this may be a good feeling but it's definitely not a painful feeling\nYou have a hundred and forty dollars simply love diamond Brendan does a diamond mounted inside a circle on the end of an adjustable chain and the diamond is uh just worried he won of course the most magical diamond on earth the simply low feminine comes in larger sizes to give her one for sweetest\nI promise you should do what it means ... on the line between mineral ... road\nWeekend wellness you buy some al right here Thirteen W. I. V. A. hanging out with Dr Mehra at ss ...\nTalking about the science behind pain and Dr ... you've\nReally kind of curious in that kind of what's going on biologically and and and um and that ... what's talk a little bit about a when a patient comes to you or or when we go to a doctor we talk a little bit about the complexities of trying to explain pain or you know understanding is there a way to kind of know somebody's paying as that is that possible\n[noise] that's a great question and I think as a position where taught empathy and hopefully we went into the field for that reason\nUh and so while I may not be able to seal the individual patients pain you do the best you can with the data that you have ... for example we talked a little bit about him or her eyes and X rays and so on and so it's so helpful to have multiple data points if I have\nAn MRI that shows me some spine damage if I had an EMT that shows me nerve damage and the patient says yeah every time I Do X Y or Z I get this radiating paint on my leg I say you know what a B and C or adding up\nThis makes sense here is a great treatment plan not always so simple though what am I Can't see her pain what if there is no pathology what if you have a ten and a ten headache today but your CAT scan looks normal this is where the challenge and the science and the beauty of medicine comes in to say how do we treat your pain how do we get you get you better\nBecause having ... double boards does that help as you were just talking marriage thinking about about um your education and your understanding I I Would assume these ... these two specialties work well it varies synergistic\nLeave very hand in hand because rather than just understanding okay what his pain I can actually say wow I understand the neurologic the\nSnaps the nerve component of why you're feeling this way and I think that's going to also be the future of pain management is how do we then tackled treating these different types of pain if it truly is all in our head and spinal cord I think that's where the treatment will lie\nOr you mentioned pain management let's talk about the I think that's that's really as far as treatment how do we how do you ... ... ... yeah\nHow do we treat pain so we're in a predicament currently in the year two thousand Eighteen we as physicians are being accused of\nPerhaps over prescribing medication under treating pain and so you think well that doesn't make sense how are you over prescribing medication but you're under treating pain and here's the reality of the situation perhaps were not listening enough and perhaps we need better\nTreatment modalities that are both supported by lawmakers policymakers um you know when I send a patient for acupuncture physical therapy yoga\nIt's so easy for me to say that as a physician and I know the science supports it but insurance doesn't pay for it how can we do these great things and so there's so many things out there that\nTreat pain even better than perhaps the pill but guess what that pill will be covered by insurance so we'll have to do a whole part to to the segment about the policy changes that maybe we need but in medicine and science were trained the best we can to hopefully he'll and help people with pain\nAnd I always say you know what pain free may not be the answer but less pain mhm coping with the pain and getting better and functional giving you your life back\nSo in pain management the goal is always let's give you your life back and get you off the couch just get you back to work let's get back to that favorite sport you like playing if we can do that multi douty therapy injections medications yoga acupuncture whatever it is let's get you back\nThere's something to him and I I Know that there's a you mentioned kind of ... the pill\nWell the automatic or you know like the insurance company is also a thing for patients as well is is I'll speak for myself is is we always want that silver bullet that ... we want okay I got this pain doctor give me something I take it in the morning and I feel great all day you mentioned things as great as like yoga is but other things that may require a little\nLittle bit of effort absolutely Asians we go\nI ... and I am guilty and this as well as most of the society is the only thing that quick fix it doubled tripled click on my computer work work work work I called the computer company it's evidence will take an hour I said oh just fix it and so he came and sort of the body is the same way patients come in and say but I have to play a game next week I had to get back to work just fix it give me a medicine but\nI see that's not how the body works it's time to have this injury some chronic injuries it's going to take time to fix it or they're its core strengthening body physical therapy again there's good habits healthy eating whatever it is\nIt does take time and patience let the body heal itself from\nDr Madeira and ... some health thank you so
