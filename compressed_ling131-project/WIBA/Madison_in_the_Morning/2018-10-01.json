and residents near La Follette getting a chance to sound opt not following two recent shootings near the high school\nA community meetings going to take place out this evening at nearby Senate middle school on the line with me this morning Madison school district's security coordinator Jo ... good morning Joe\nGood morning Robin so it was last fall it's home coming over the weekend things go off without a hitch\nAfter sounds like everything was fine um the game was friday night we had a few extra Madison officers at the game and then Saturday Night third dance was held at school normally attended by up works with a thousand students and kids and um that one just fine\nGood glad to hear it because you know we've been hearing of a couple of high profile recently in Milwaukee and not that long ago in Rockford on the football field whereas shootings have happened during the game\n... I had received no phone calls no reports uh this weekend about anything happening either a gamer dance to heroin I take not hearing anything is a good thing\nYeah yeah I think there's somebody would have led to know [noise] ah it's still not last Thursday and did you guys do it again friday were all students going into ... were wounded\nYes Robin we did that was the first time in my memory of met every being done at a school in Madison but you know to put it in some context year you know Wednesday morning I'm off campus we ever ... the disturbance fights\nShooting incident happened ... and the student was shot and a minor league injured a nonetheless but he came back towards school and we weren't\nSure going into Wednesday night how deep the conflict was that started this and the Madison ... police department was really just in Canada beginning ours their investigation\nSo we made a call and that Wednesday night and get the word out to a family an students that that we're going to do this for the next two days and on top of that closed down the campus during the lunch hour we thought that was just doing due diligence in our part\nAnd um it was quite an effort on Thursday morning we are ... took us about dirty extra minutes from the start of the school day to get the school loaded with all the students in there but on friday morning we put a new plan in place where we had two entrances with screening\nEquipment to W. police department gave us some scanners that they use the call center and um we set up a second station and that was much better and we actually had the whole school loaded um\nStudents wait twenty in the morning and the parents over there were phenomenal they've got tons and tons of doughnuts for the\nKids that are standing out but it it when it went pretty well full days\nSo but even though on on Thursday the first uh effort and a half an hour I mean to me that doesn't seem like an unnecessary length of time\nYou know and it was kind of our first go at something like an hour I Can't describe her as gloating literally loading twelve airplanes but fixing our shared a within an hour and the kids of course\nYou know they they don't show up to school in our early they're getting their you know like they usually do five to ten minutes before the class there so it took a little bit to get them all through but uh we got it on\nAnd in both days now the nah no contraband or specifically weapons discovered\nNo end and it was really a there's a lot of uh there's there are laws in the state that allow 'em an industry are so schools to search bags searched students stricter lockers just based on reasonable suspicion\nAnd was we're going through that we really didn't identify any reasonable suspicion or grounds to really do much of a further search in any particular student are coming in that day\n[noise] now I'm a and also closing on campus it's an open campus during the lunch hour now it goes back to open again this week right\nYes we're um talked with the police department last week they got that everybody that's far charged\nIn that incident and identified we feel like we get a pretty good handle on that so we're going back to business as usual this morning Robin but I Will say that you know probably starting with this meeting tonight taking place it's done it um there's a lot of discussion out there that's going to take\nPlace over you know open campus this environments are just not as ... ... ... dollars to the high schools and you know and that's something that I'm sure that the medicine school board or is going to be very interested in participating in that conversation as well\nYeah because it appears that followed the school of the hour and ... well not literally an hour but this year that's not a good thing I mean there's just been a lot of um um incidents that have been going on where ... the headlines in the attention but you don't have to go back a too far to recall the memorial Madison east\nRight exactly Robin all of the principles that cities or main high schools have to do a lot of legwork building ... maintaining relations with the neighbors in around their school\nI mean it's quite a challenge in ... west high school yeah twenty two hundred kids I'm In the middle of that environment up there a lot of them are going out during the day time just to move their cars so they don't get parking ticket [laughter]\nUm it's just really kind of crazy I'm In that respect and uh but uh this has been kind of a tradition in Madison schools it's been like this for years and um it'll be interesting to see how this um um discussion takes evolves quite frankly over the next several weeks\nSure 'cause I mean I and I understand the you know residents are around the schools that are saying you know open campus and what's that without sounding a like a grumpy old lady get off my lawn but what's the benefit for having an open campus\nWell um I think there's some logistical issues involved there to just the fact that um you know it's difficult to\nI Know Dr granite west you know would have a problem feeding twenty two hundred kids in school given the time that she has [noise] you know they're almost dependent upon kids going out of the school to get lunch um in some respects um La Follette last week we made it worked and I must eat food services actually brought in\nA food um on friday they had a cookout for on their\nUm Thursday um we actually know that they open it up made it free lunch if you didn't have cars we couldn't um denounce obviously that we were

Hitler's yesterday but it really didn't matter he won the national league batting title of first brewer ... title and uh he most likely or at least in my opinion will be the national league most valuable player was kind of cool for credit counseling to\nTake yellow gender the game and the eighth inning so he could get one last loud ovation from brewers fans at least during the regular season um this was a special season for this young man and in brewers fans get to watch them for four more years at least that'll that'll be a tree\nHe's twenty six years older than the prime of his career he just had a seizure that was especially the second half historic in many ways um it just um the last few weeks of the season just seem to be able to do whatever you wanted to do at the plate and they got into one of those groups have players just dream\nAbout and I do think he's going to be the most valuable player on the people in Chicago want to tell you it's hobby by as but\nHe does not have a year like a yellow tag stuff that was that we had a ... I have a sentimental manager don't they take them out there so you have a standing ovation so that was a cool moment is the place was packed Alex was surprised they didn't tell them they're going to do that he was a little shape issue\nAbout it he didn't know what are you supposed\nTo be like Queen Elizabeth started gave me a little hand Waverly\nExactly there's another tie breaker I mentioned the Rockies and Dodgers today so you know let's play hypothetical so Europe the brewers happened to lose today who's the better match up for them and that wild card game hit\nThe fence to I'm a pitch is you know and when you got a winner take all game it's going to depend on the pitching match up here there's been some thinking that if it's the Dodgers they might even pitch cursed Sean three days rest because he did touch on Saturday\nSo or or friday or whatever it was Saturday yeah yeah\nYeah that's a very dangerous or to the yeah so um\nI mean you know what if it gets to the ... again tomorrow night where it's literally an elimination game it's like you know it's all hands on deck the bullpen very warming up every ... you know you're not going to let any pitcher gave up many wrong so uh they like to avoid that you know what they'd like to avoid that eliminates shit\nYou know if it's so much out one day that I look at the difference of the winter and the lose the winters get the winter it's ... ...
