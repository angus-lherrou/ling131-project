seven thirty three Madison the morning on this Tuesday October second\nWhen we're going to keep the clouds today but it looks like we're going to lose the rain is our gloomy stretch a weather continues joining me this morning twenty seven storm track meteorologist Brandon ... good morning Brandon good morning to Robin well we've had a pile of rain to start the week um how much you in the Madison areas Sunday and then yesterday\nA we picked up two point oh five uh yesterday um and we average to point for for the entire month of October so we got nearly among worth of rain in the first day of October how 'bout that\nOh shit yeah of course in a year that that's the last thing we want to see how I Know or some uh flooding concerns once again for already hard hit areas like black earth and uh [noise] uh south western Wisconsin actually are getting the brunt of it yesterday right I saw a lot of flash flood warnings out there\nA grant Kelly in particular and they do have an aerial ... a flood advisory in effect for most of that county shrew later on this morning a Doppler radar estimating upwards of three to four inches of rain in those areas\n... and stretching into portions of a Dane we had some county a highway some back roads in the cross plains ... area that had water over it yep um last night so um but the good news today I mean I Do see a little bit ah tonight is it possible to the north of us\n[laughter] yeah it looks like it would be to the north if it happens at all um our next good chance for rain comes tomorrow night\nThat will come after a warm day tomorrow actually feel like summer tomorrow with a breezy south when we should get up to around eighty but then a cold front will march into that more and more humid air math in multi a line of storms come on true\nLater tomorrow night are probably right around bedtime or shortly thereafter and then there's more rain and more and has thereafter as I'm sure you saw in the seven day\nYeah and it is a stretched out but still again um you know it's something we really don't need but no I'm not going to cost\nA lot of the um ... it's\nA nightmare that it did back in August [laughter] well you know he wouldn't accept you know we didn't expect that\nYou know and so it kind of one of those you never say never I mean I I wouldn't expect that but um you know like like I said we didn't expect a fourteen Fifteen inches in eight hours either and I'm you know my computer models just don't have the ability to pick up on that sort of thing what I can tell you though is you're looking at\nSo in the long range forecast models of going from\nA tomorrow night through the middle of next week or ingesting it additional treat to ... inches of rain over that time frame still had given the fact that we already have two inches in Madison and we're going to be well above average by October tenth yeah\nShe had said that they usually would get just about two inches for the month of October right yeah good golly\n[noise] and uh although or are we just you know I mean should we be on the this cool at this time of year or is this just a an off week 'cause I I'm looking at ... see a next Tuesday Seventy five are high end Monday Seventy three so it\nKind of all over the place certainly yeah it's been very changeable and I guess that's to the fact that the jet stream has been kind of right or the area with some ... some bumps here and there are so you know you get warm Sturges and colder surges in in between when you have that change you have these\nThese are rainy story about and so we're just kind of stuck in his act of weather pattern a true next week and that led to these kind of yelling of temperatures\nOkay and it yeah it's just over the weekend we're on my husband and I recalling last year a lot of the end of September October fest celebrations and last year it\nWas so darn hot right oh I Know and\nThis year it was almost too cool to be out and about [noise]\nYeah um my

and tee shirts last year around and you're all bundled up\nA dress for winter is about thirty five to forty degrees cooler one year later\nExpecting unexpected that's for sure but I mean we're only the second day of October so yeah well we might have a more than we want for rain um we can't rule out you know it stretches some warm weather coming back in Indian summer\nOh sure I mean tomorrow we're talking eighty a unit that that'll be short lived and then you had mentioned early next week uh we should pop back up into the seventies and\nI might even be even a little conservative with those loaded mid seventies um I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up in the upper seventies um [noise] you know it comes with a storm system to the west though that could lead to some showers and
