morning Marissa\nThanks for joining me so we're going to be um reducing adoption fees is this for dogs and puppies as well\nSo for now a running through that someday we're reducing adoption is actually just for the last dog shelter as either a dog that has\nBeen staying at the site he for about thirty days there for the most of us had longer state of using those fees down um we're going to be also offering all this week for any adopted dog half price microchip\nUm and uh having a lot of giveaways and also a a drawing for free dog training\nNice I'm Marie so what is a typical turnaround time for a dog now you say you this find your ... ah that is running this week at Daytona humane society for reduced of fees are applies to dogs that have been there more than thirty days is that typical or did you see some for a few months\nYou know it can really depends on the third dog sometimes they'll come in and within a matter of a day or two they're adopted it on their way home and sometimes for some of our dog it can just the end they are there patiently waiting for just sat right family and a lot of our dogs right now who have\nBeen here for thirty days they're born um you know we're having a hard time understanding why they're maybe not getting some of the um the look some of them um\nMaybe they're a little bit shy when they first initially people but they weren't as quickly as a whole variety of reasons why a dog might have a slightly longer a and we hope is that um that hunter fight do a promotion will help people come in and spend that little extra time to get to know our pop\nMarissa what is the adoption fee for like an adult dog\nOn so it can really depend right now for any of those thoughts that we do have that uh uh the lower adoption the three that if you want to come in and the a nine year old rat terrier named stayed easily had a very long stay with us all her adoption\nThe would normally be a hundred and fifty dollars and this week I got to be

auction prices\nAnd I'm looking at say to you right now and she's just absolutely adorable\nOh my gosh she is one of my favorites and she's one of those like I said I said yeah I think it's having a harder time because she's a senior gal and she thinks a couple of minutes to warm up when she does she has that type that is just bouncing around\nAll the crawl up on your lap\nYup she's got a black face in a white body and yeah so she's senior she's nine years old but keep in mind with a smaller dog a rat terrier a type like this I mean their longevity are typically will run a lot longer than you know your bigger dogs\nYou're exactly right she is nine years old which are technically makes for a senior but she is barely on that if the air and really you want to look at that personality and she is still a very active girl she loves to go for those nice long walk\nOh that's good and also um as you were mentioning you can get a ... for free dog training classes you know you were mentioning she was a little shy and some dogs I'm I'm guessing a they they can socialize them with the dog training classes to ride it's not just teach them tricks\nYes so um our dog training class actually held here at the shelter we have different levels for adult thoughts that also class are puffy and yeah it's not just a great way to start learning this extra tricks that that\nKind of have your old part is a great way to socialize their dog with other dogs and also really bond with your dog\nOkay and also included in the adoption fee for a lot of dogs that come in whether they're strays or um they've

and something I've learned in in the conversations with you is\nReally that that the shingles are just a very they're an important part but there are small part of a a greater system and even if you are able to get up close as they all they look okay the stuff that you guys are doing you're doing it on another level you're looking for things that basically figuring out what's going on on the underside there whether it's going up into an addict and crawl space which as homeowners\nMentioned going up on the roof I don't do going up that addict\nI don't do either and certainly I'm not going to go on those little nooks and crannies your guys they're up there looking to make sure that that everything is yes working\nProperly yes I I said all the time the shingles cover the roofing system that's the important part or you know it happens all the time people get an estimate from us and they want to do it\nYou know and I'm not going to sugarcoat it we're usually more expensive but when it comes down to it\nWhen we compare apples to apples what we're doing and what other people are doing there's a reason why\nAnd when we come out and we give a roof estimate we show you exactly what we're doing exactly what products were using where we're using them how much of them were using were actually going to build that roofing system for you in front of you so you know exactly what's going on\nAnd then when we do your roof\nMy roofing supervisor is going to be taking pictures before after during we make a nice booklet for you so you know oh hey\nWe toured off you've got clean ducking or we toured off we found some rotten ducking we replaced it we show you that we replaced it then as we lay the different layers and pieces of the roofing system on do the flashing there's pictures of all that the whole way through and the finished rough so you have a nice book showing\nThis is what my roof looks like because once the shingles around you have no idea and then if you do go to sell your house all of that goes with the war goes with it and really where it has come into play here in the last couple of years we've had some hail storms\nIs dealing with the insurance company once we have that really good roof on there with the lifetime warranty\nNow we have proof of what's underneath those shingles now your insurance company has to replace the roof exactly like it was so it's huge it's a huge peace of mind and I know people really really like getting that um that book with the photos all the way through so they know exactly what's going on\nThe phone call right now at Larson home services again the telephone number five three five forty three forty three that's five three five forty three forty three for Larson home services\nAnd you mentioned getting down to the getting down to the wood on the on the roof I hear people say oh we will put another layer up but that you guys don't\nDo that you know and and actually it I think it's legal by code oh really it it is and it's it's it's really odd we'll go to people's houses and they've got a week and while the other guy said they just go over the top of the singles and I'll say it again if we just went to
