Wisconsin radio network bill Scott\nBrought you by metro for to Madison where you get two years prepaid maintenance on any newer used car purchase metro Ford of Madison dot com bill how're you doing today good Ryan how are you I'm good I'm good so what do you make of all there's a criticism\nYou know kind of he came out in the open Aaron Rodgers did on Sunday complaining about how terrible the all ... and kind of criticized coach Mike mccarthy under his breath without speaking specifically McCarthy but you could kinda tell where he was going don't we see this and hear this like every year\nWe do and uh and quite frankly it's surprising that that it has to happen every year I blame part of it on Rogers when I blamed part of it on McCarthy I'm obviously a\nThere if Roger is having the complained publicly it means that he's not a despite what McCarthy says it means he's his ah his concerns\nAre not being a ... at least openly considered a ... you know being in in a meeting behind closed doors yeah didn't\nRogers attempt forty passes do against buffalo\nYou did and he only completed twenty two\nThere were five drops ... yeah but he said that uh the Monti Adam should have been targeted twenty times I Know yet aid catches he was probably targeted maybe a dozen times he\nWas targeted fourteen times and and if you look at statistics are from NFL games\nUh especially pack the Packers to throw the football obviously a lot um fourteen to Fifteen targets is a lot of target and it you know I I think there have been more at ... you know I'm sure at at at a time or two but for the most part that's a pretty good number so I'm not so sure\nYou know I my guess is here is that you know Cobb did not way last week because of the hamstring injury\nAnd uh in at some point of the third quarter drowned them all out and went down with a concussion and it got to the point where there weren't too many uh a veteran receiver left and there was nothing but young guys and I'm not so sure that Rogers is real comfortable with those young guys yet so he'd like to see that ball distributed more to that guy\nYeah like Jimmy Graham how much more can they get him involved\nFor I think they can get them more involved certainly I I think he only had fixed targets in that game so\nThere's there's room for for those two to grow I Do know this though that um teams have you know they find a little bit easier to take Jimmy ... away with various coverage is than they\nCan't get out and move around the pocket and throw on the run and things like that I think he went you know when he can find it a pocket or maybe not as good or at least not at this stage of his career and you know the biking let\nHim roam all over the place and the packages that you know we're not going to let him get out and run and pick up first down and things like that and they didn't they they did a great job\nOf sticking to the plant and making sure that they knew where he was all the time to\nChurch Packers have another division game coming up a Sunday at Detroit what's to fear about math Patricia as lions well\nFirst of all they you know Matthew Stafford is you know you either get the really good Matthew Stafford or you get a not so good math used to average because he does have a tendency to throw picks once in a while um that'd be instead\nThey're off to a one in three start they'd like to win this or that ... is is a division game and I think this is always a difficult game for the Packers whenever they go to Ford Field so I just that I had this ... this being a pretty close game and\nUm you know whether the Packers can pull it out I I Would give them the dish but I think it's going to be close\nAnd Patricia is known for his deep and that's what he worked with with
