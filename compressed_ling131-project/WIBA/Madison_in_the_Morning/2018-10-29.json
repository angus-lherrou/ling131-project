you know there's some good things that he did the ... you want to build on and and put some areas so they need to improve on\nYeah I Know going into the game a lot of the talk was about Wisconsin's deep and trying to contain the Wildcats quarterback Clayton source and you did a pretty good job against him I mean you're forced three turnovers he was only Seventeen at thirty through the air\nWe did a good job and and he had a nice job and and kinda got us a little bit and so the with his feet you know and and he was they had really been\nRunning quite like that this year and and ah he's a heck of a competitor but there were some really good at which you know defensively a at a really nice school and stand that um you know we we did some good things but just didn't put it together and and again I think that\nWhich awesome love the game of football was really all three phases half the kind of come from each other play off each other and then there were times when we did but we didn't do it a consistently and uh\nYeah you know injuries you and I talked about it probably too much and I'm sure you're sick of it and I am too actually but um you know leave ... goes down coal van land and you know I mean those are you hate to see that I mean all leaving has given us his heart and soul has any\n... and they have it on and so many guys are and and even though the score didn't turn out the way you you want it at all you know I thought the effort and and there was some tremendous you know guys putting out there and you feel\nYou feel for guys when they when they get injured and and you know have a chance looks like both of them will miss some time I think it is things a little bit more when it's a senior 'cause you know the and they know that those those opportunities are are getting\nFewer and fewer and so you feel certainly for the individual and then leave that has been you know food they got on campuses you know kind of the world's all and guys and so you know one you hope they get healthy and in both will\nCertainly recover from them but you see the you know they have to pay for them to miss any time as a too bad and posts from playing football yeah and so it's a kind of see a little bit more a as a weaker unfolds on guys but looks like those two um may miss some time yeah\nDo you expect Alex will be able to play Saturday against Rutgers are not sure yet I'm\nNot sure what kind of ... it's still the protocol and and uh they got a chance you know maybe hopefully get some guys back and certainly the one\nSure and finally you know you're still mathematically alive to get to the Big Ten championship game but Michael Dieter I think he put it best the focus right now not is not that you got to figure out how to play better football in in that you've got to do that every week though don't you\nDo and that's where you know certainly all of us understand the narratives that other stand at the end of it if it does X Y and Z than you their\nChances but I think the big thing for us you know as players and coaches is you got to take advantage of each week and that's where I get is this thing you put so much into each week and just\nBeing in that when it doesn't go the way I like it to you know it's things but you're in the middle of it and and so to look up and try to see where it's all good\nOr how it's going to unfold I thank you you don't help yourself and you miss out so I think that Michael's exactly right you know we've gotta were playing the game of football and we want to play it as well as we can I think that's got to be the focus and\nAlways have read that\nWent in as a byproduct of doing everything the right way and and are the best that you can and so we just got to focus on the game and certainly you know Rutgers the records that uh what they want it I'm sure but you you watch the film and the oil yesterday and they need to get ready for change sham\nIt's a town on a team of our guys\nYou know

scarecrow terrier they found little\nMini bib overalls to put all my goodness talk about cute rage\n... see I have a comment on any of this stuff is not as far as we now uh they're too busy dealing with chickens and costumes now they say it's okay [laughter] we're flu season upon us since you be worrying about other things don't whether you to dress up your chicken\n[noise] ah also there was um uh the part of the contest in Belleville was stupid pet tricks so basically tricks dogs can do there was a three legged dog parks let's just say he won I mean anytime you enter a disabled dog into a contest\nThanks yeah kind of takes the cake little fellow got around\nLike nobody's business do you need that for the leg it's it's funny it's amazing I should say how um dogs in people to you know

their disposable income\nMatching the lowest level since twenty Thirteen shot futures indicator\nAnd there are people in in ... you know when it let's be honest the Bruce company has a place for people who like unique different kinds of thing yet I feel things their shop against Bruce company I think that they want to do is is they want to get in early they want to get those things before there\nThere's limited quantity of a lot of stuff I'm I'm not a deep buyer I'm a wide in shallow buyer so\nYou know if you see something there that you really like there's probably not a hundred of them maybe will only be six or two or one so best to come in and if you see something that you love you should get it because I don't know that it's\nGoing to be there next week or even tomorrow sometimes\nYou know sometimes I think Lisa ... people that are very anti Christmas or in their hearts pro Christmas\nI don't\nThink anybody's anti Christmas they're just anti Christmas too early or what they would every body has a time in their head when I feel like it's appropriate like I've noticed even it might be October\nWhich would be okay but it's Ninety degrees and that seems to be you know a trigger or it might be September but it's fifty and people are OK with it so but you know it's beautiful I don't think anybody else in the area does\nChristmas the way the Bruce company does it they're twenty seven different\nThemed trees and really cool lights from Europe and you know twelve colors valley D's for you know just regular string in your house\nLots of different choices for artificial trees with you know made by great manufacturers with really solid warranties behind them and of course like gobs of really beautiful\nOrnaments in a huge range of prices from you know two Ninety nine to two hundred\nNinety nine [laughter]\nGuys limited you want to I mean\nEverybody yeah yeah you can do yes or something for everybody if you can't find in ornament the kind of speaks to I don't know that there's an arm out there that will speak to say oh come on in\nThe forest you'll find them twenty thirty ... street right off right and strained Middleton you seem right off the highway drive by stopping ... twenty thirty ... real quick you mentioned your your uh the ... the the the the I have used more fake 'cause there are real tree artificial or is it a good\nWord less and less some less negativity\nUp there is a difference in ... across the board is is um some artificial trees clearly if you get up there close especially you know they artificial um a lot of them are very cheaply made overseas and just kind of I\nThink yeah I think most of them are probably made overseas whether they're cheap or not cheap and I would say that you know as a rule\nThere are differences between the tree itself you know you have heavier hardware the um the wires that are the tips will be will be be fear but where the price difference really is is in the light that's that's where it is and and\nIt's the quality of the wiring systems and the quality of the lights my favorite ones now are we have um one called the Alaskan and we have it in a whole bunch of sizes and ... narrow and fall and all the different lights\nBut all the connections are in the poll oh so you put the bottom in ... in the stand and you plug it in and then you put the next section in and you give it a little twist and I was yeah and you know more of that fumbling\nI mean when you put it and get it out of the box it's not too difficult to figure out but a lot of people then at the end the season they unplug everything and then when they go to plug it in again then they get these runs of you know eight or ten plugs and then\nThe trees blow because the circuits are overloaded and so this totally eliminates that it's all the gas workers out of it and that's the Alaskan line that's the Alaska and it's a really good looking tree and it it's safe to say it has a higher profile off the floor so I say more room for president [laughter]\nPlease the brakes comes to us from the ... you could find them on line ... company dot com that's Bruce company ... phone number eight three six
