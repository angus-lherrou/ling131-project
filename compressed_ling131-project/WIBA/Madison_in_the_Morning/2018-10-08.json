media experts with Madison college good morning Steve burning Robin so now I'm guessing you also receive this hoax message on Facebook and if you can just to fill our listeners in if they were one of the lucky ones who didn't get it on what it said\nWell over the past few days there's been locked up front hosting a a a bastard bank something along the line or\nBuy a couch has been cloned if you receive a second I'm friend request from me it's not me don't accept that as a scam okay [laughter] so it is possible however highly unlikely that an account could actually get quote where someone could do\nFor cutting ... account of yours and then tries to get your friends to like it so that they can get access to their face their Facebook data that happened one that a great while but the recent rash of this message getting a shared around is an absolute hoax\nAnd what people are trying to do these scammers who who originally this hoax is\nThey create copy they ask people to post that even if you were structure yeah how ... click and share it so it shared word for word and that's the important thing here\nI'm this is basically what I call it soccer scam when when they share a um people can go in and look for that exact verbiage on people's accounts who may or may not be locked down\nAnd realize wow this person's gullible I can put them on a target list for future scam effort so they're really just fishing for soccer is right now\nOkay I see 'cause I was wondering what's the point of this other you know just hopes I mean with this ah alone what they ah what's been going viral over the past few days I mean this isn't going to get our personal information it's just seen if where soccer's\nIt really is at at this point it scare me as kind of a two page cross that you have to identify people who are easy target\nAnd then you have to actually go after them this is a phase one attack uh they're they're trying to get a list of who out there you know don't think before they click and of course this is becoming a stomach issue all over America with with social media usage of people just\nSharing stuff without even questioning ... where it came from\nAnd this is a really easy one because you know a month ago Facebook did have a data breach\nAnd that's what the tiny with this was so suspicious 'cause yeah we're talking some fifty million users right yeah yeah\nYeah and they did and I I think that I think the scammers are kind of taking advantage of that because those people had their accounts respect so if you were on that list I was one of them actually ... anywhere that you were walked into Facebook on your phone on a computer tablet at work\nOr you've got logged into Facebook walked out of everything so you just had to read walk back yeah it is what's called the token it's a little piece of information like if you walked in on a computer\nThat was what the the the data was ... you know there's no evidence that any accounts were hacked into on this breach a month ago but I think when this happened I think the scammers that hey this would be a good time to you know get people worry that their accounts been hacked\nAnd become you know maybe a few weeks ago they discovered they had to ... go to thinking about it it's Russian their mind that that will make an easy target\n[noise] and I know Steve when you were one of the the fifty million users how did you find out where was it just uh that she had to re log in or were you notified\nBoth are originally uh because I checked Facebook or that it wants to their um I I caught it on my own I I Walk ... actually was like oh and I watch uh you know open my Facebook\nMhm and it was walked out and I just I just simply had the clicking\nAbout any of that one of my password I just had the ... on the cage and I was brought back yet I knew right then and there is something that happened a shortly after Facebook did send a message explaining what had happened\nUm it it made total but then but of course you know over the next week or so as I used the various you know I'm equipment that I log in to use Facebook I had to do this on on every one of them so I'm I'm Glad Facebook did that and that cost us right away\nYou know they they said that people's accounts for not compromise we don't have to worry about it you don't even have to change your password although that is something that people should do on a regular basis uh and uh\nBecause if I could point out you know getting your passwords for Facebook a lot of people will use those same passwords for under you know very important ah right so like there may be their banking sites or what have you\nRight yeah and that's the thing is is there is you know general password rules in terms of like studying a password and secure password\nA lot of people fall you know end of the year there's a national hackers organization of all groups they are published a list of like a top a password and use the United states
