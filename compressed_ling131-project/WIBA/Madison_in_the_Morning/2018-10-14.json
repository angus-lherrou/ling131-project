{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "And of course is not as a defense lawyer but as a father grieving as it was it three weeks ago that you lost your daughter Molly to heroin\nDutch troops thanks for having me there are things you can share with people that may help our daughter Molly died at twenty nine of an overdose in Maine where she was living a she was found on the twenty fourth of September ...\nWhen a roommate return from out of town\nSo yeah it's it's tough but I think we learned a lot and I'd love to share it with people because I think there's a lot of people in our shoes I've had clients whose parents are still grieving and so I'm hoping that by being open about this\nAnd talking about it we can help them no they're not alone and maybe help steer them two ways to help them avoid the pain we're going through\n... it's obviously and and and the pain just never goes away and it's still very raw right now\nBeing you know it it is and you know I said to somebody yesterday Robyn it's it's like losing a limb you learn to adapt you'll learn to cut your steak with one hand and tie your shoes the one hand but you always know are missing it\nAnd I said to my wife and she said I'd give up my arm today to have her back it's really hard\nBut you have to move on I have so much more respect now for the parents of service people and law enforcement who die on the line of duty I don't know how they take that news but so I look at this is maybe something I can help somebody else was and that's why I'm here\nNow at twenty nine you know has a parent's you have to uh buy oldest is twenty nine and a kind of read the five relief at least I I Do as far as okay getting out of the twenties and thirties these bad things can happen obviously\nThat's wrong well how long had Molly then are addicted to look let me let me grab your phrase a sigh of relief as you reach your thirties well\nA couple of things I'll say psychologist a psychotherapist have a new term they've been using for the last ten years is called emerging adults when I was Eighteen Seventeen national my dad said are you going to college and I said no and he goes and rent stew [laughter]\nWe emerged immediately at that point um but it's a reflection of the culture that has young people maturing more slowly and and most people aren't considered\nA full adult 'til at least twenty five now if you take somebody on a normal arc of maturity and gross as they reach the thirties you do as a parent hope that they're\nInto their own world and and and getting getting through it and finding the wrong way but when you have instead dealt with a child since she was\nFourteen and Fifteen who struggled with severe depression severe anxiety ah cutting those kinds of things and drinking at a very early age heavy drinking or you don't ever have that moment\nAs they approach thirty were you saying I'm almost out of the woods you every week and every month you always know in the back of your mind whatever successes they've had if they have an established a long term pattern of sobriety in healthy living\nYou could get that call at ... up\nMolly uh what kind of ... he said uh you know was depressed and hunting and a heavy drinking in fourteen Fifteen\nWhat was she like as a child a a reading her obituary described her that just seemed to be a a very outgoing girl on the top squad I've seen pictures of Mali not that beauty has anything to do with if you're going to be addicted or depression if it does not\nBut from the outside looking in you see somebody so beautiful and here like what do they have to be the fact\nThat you know that's looks can be deceiving we know that but but her childhood it she had her ... she had her behavioral issues there were probably the initial signs of what was to calm but you know we all raise our kids you when you bring home your first baby from the hospital it's always your first baby\nDoesn't matter what age they are and she was our first baby and she didn't come into this world\nA on anything but her own terms and my wife was in labor and about thirty three hours Somali was stubborn from the get go she wasn't ready\nAnd she was three weeks later I'm thirty three hours of a noose labor so we we had a toughie on her hands but she was tough what's interesting is going back now and reading what her old high school and middle school friends wrote about her\nAnd how they knew her because we knew or as a daughter and you know as a parent you're trying to draw lines we have four kids the other three kids were alive and doing well and they're grieving too they're hurting too but Mali was a very active young lady she loved to sing she loved dance she was very\nInvolved in in groups of friends uh she was she played Darcy in the wizard of Oz under the late Steve balls are acquainted peace in the knock them dead she even played it she encouraged them to let her have a live Toto on stage and she did and we have pictures of her holding a dog in the play that's pretty daring for an eighth grader\nShe was also she also starred uh briefly in one play gypsy I'm\nFor Nancy thorough se T. M. and\nYou know I just [laughter] the moments that hits you are this morning I pick up the newspaper and I read an article about her former cast may Brian ... who's a\nWorld class choreographer and director now and he's he's the he's in great demand and he in Mali were in the chorus together of Pinocchio when they were\nFive and six and seven so she had a lot of spunk she had a lot of personality she was extremely creative she was very talented\nAnd she had something inside of her and this is an illness it's it's an illness you ... are you born with it maybe or does it grow yes and and everybody who looks at heroin addiction and says those are junkies those are bad people it's not us and we wouldn't want to talk about that\nThey don't understand it but the the addiction\nAnd they use an abusive alcohol and drugs go hand in hand with the things that probably were growing up you know some ... sometimes you hear about very successful athletes who also have Great Depression and they overcome their insecurities by immense\nEffort and striving at championship some of our even our noted local champions on on world class unlimited levels have had notable mental health issues and sometimes I think people seem to compensate that's one way to compensate for the demons inside you that make you think\nLife is horrible and you're unhappy another way is to escape\nAnd Molly's escape over the years went between energetic bursts of employment and education and even at a younger age arts and music to the escape that we all know you can find in a bottle of Jamieson or at the end of a naval so\nShe was a great young girl she ... her nickname was peanut yeah you know where I'm from well that's a great question um [noise]\nWhen my wife was pregnant and went for her first ultrasound back then you'd come home with a little Polaroid looking piece of paper and she brought home the ultrasound with the ark and the waves and\nThere was this shape and there and my wife said that's our daughter or that's our child we didn't know was girl she my wife swore was but we didn't know and I said that's not a child that's a peanut that [laughter] and so she was all his nickname peanuts and and\nShe liked it um uh and so but it's stuck with her ... and and yet it reflects an innocence of a time that unfortunately she couldn't easily get back to in her mind I encouraged her to try again at some local theater or some music and\nShe just concluded she wasn't good enough\n... it's still ... did she go to college and what what what she did what was her profession or what was she hoping\n... before she went to edge what high school and she lasted three years there\nShe earned enough credits for three years at edge to graduate the next year from memorial here in Madison but truthfully her senior year was was a train wreck drinking drinking lots of drinking she flunked every exam she flunked every class she passed English and she got a diploma [noise]\nUm I'm not criticizing the public schools if they have somebody was enough credits to graduate they hand them their diploma\nBut I find it ironic that that she walked out of memorial after you're there on the palm spot at Memorial for a year or two and all she really had to show for we're probably quite a few damage brain cells did she have some good time short did she do some fun things yeah she worked\nAt the local Pizza Hut she had a good time working there she made some money she paid for her own gas that kind of stuff but bottom line was high school it was clear by then there was trouble in fact we had a pitched battle she applied\nTo college at Arizona State university and was admitted to the actually I think it's the Walter Cronkite school of journalism now she want it to be a a TV news anchor\nOn that was her goal combining her August\nIt's really beautiful looks ... and her her very strong communication skills and enter enter with\nSo she was admitted to a pretty good program ... even with her disastrous\nHigh school and while she ate the ACT and she had a diploma okay um and that got around yeah without even ... well I'm not sure they saw those grades when they admitted there now they go back and check but there are different now than it is yes they are but she did get in and then we had we had a debate in our house and this was\nThis was the beginning of of of a long series of of disagreements we didn't want her to go\nWe wanted her to go into treatment and I found was Pegasus help a residential treatment program in Arizona we said we'll pay for you to go there and when you get sober attend to ask you because you know ASU has a reputation as sort of you W south\nAnd really I guess I didn't realize how massive party school and a good academic school they've lord away some of our best professors it has a great endowment but any academically it sound as as you W Madison socially it's very unsound in terms of its it's alcohol behavior and they have the same problems we do see a take", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Madison in the Morning", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
