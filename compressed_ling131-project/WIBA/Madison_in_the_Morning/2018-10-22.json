morning on this Monday October twenty seconds well the mid term elections just two weeks in a day away President Trump continues to rally the troops ads does former President Obama on the line with me this morning Fox News correspondent Rachel southern Lynn Good morning Rachel\nHey good morning so as far as uh comparing the rallies side by side um they're they're way more a rock is for the president are they not\nOh no doubt and there's more that President Trump has been holding I saw a number today that kind of surprised me it shouldn't but uh he's held twenty seven rally so far this year a president former President Obama has been a kind of laying low helped me in Nevada today\nIn the Senate race there a President Trump was there for a Dean Heller over the weekend but there's no comparison\n... and in fact an interesting that this morning is that President Trump's approval rating stands at forty seven percent now that is two points higher than for President Obama's was when the ten\nWhen he was facing the turns remember he had a pretty heavy shellacking then uh yeah the president will be in a in Houston, Texas today and they can't even it all the people in you're talking about comparison of rallies\nThey have more than one hundred thousand requests for tickets at this rally\nAnd of course this rally getting a lot of attention as healthy side by side by as former nemesis or that but as we've seen over the past couple of years I mean what happens on the campaign trail quickly is forgotten and they become the best of friends of course he's a rally for Ted Cruz\nTed Cruz and he should be doing a little bit better than the has been it gets paid or work there I Believe he's about seven point the head now and uh yeah so but he has been asked about that over and over and he says\nThis is the behind he's put it behind them both and I haven't seen too many spat between crews and President Trump in Washington I sense that the president got here but yeah twenty sixteen it was a total smack down even remember when have at the ... the when he said he's going to throw his support behind but then candidate Trump is kind of doing on this knows that\nTime remember then candidate Trump he walked in and it's like shadow in the back\nOf their ... and now all of that we just want to forget all that stuff\nI I Know we have we have real a short term a ...\nRaised here as far as uh what all played out two years ago and the same another former opponent or when they were going for the nomination Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker now the president's going to be a up near Warsaw\nOn a Wednesday and oh what do you make of this uh a Washington Post story saying that President Trump advisers encouraging him to blow off the Walker rally because uh the governor's down in the polls it depends on which poll you look at too I mean\nYeah you know what and when it comes to when it comes to the polls I think that uh really uh people are being so much more careful people I'm a journalist and the rest of us and what happened in ... sixteen and you know I it looks like it's still on the president's agenda yeah looking ahead\nTo where he's going to be still expected to be in Wisconsin\nUm and I think that really has scheduled kind of tells the story as to where he's hiding it tells the story about what's important to Republicans also be a Charlotte North Carolina and then Murfreesboro Illinois going to Houston today it's showing at the Senate truly a they're holding the Republicans are looking to hold us than it maybe Congress the\nHouse as day is something that they may understand they they flip it may lose more states\nUm so yeah I mean he ... at this point it looks like it's going to be in Wisconsin on Wednesday night\nYeah you know and it it it's funny when when he's told not to do something it seems that kind of antagonize the sand wraps them up even more so now yeah really going to come\nTo the reverse psychology Trump\nOnto an former President Obama and you know he was he's no slouch as far as I'm rallies no they they don't have the crowd noise or the the mega hats are\nBut you know you recall Rachel I mean back in ... I remember a you know a ... to eat here in Madison a ethical center it was just unbelievable\nCrowded and just uh the response it was quite something different level\nIt is it different he's president bonded with a different campaigner and hope and change message certainly resonated throughout the country and eight no doubt about it and and\nUh obviously he's a great orator people love to hear President Obama that people will be turning in to his speech today I'm sure the networks will be and and they should I mean this is a former president who is who is speaking publicly and that that's appropriate uh and yeah he is different style that he's a compelling\nSpeaker whether or not you you like his politics president of on a farm president on his compelling and I'm sure we'll be hearing from him today\nYeah and we're going to see him and uh you know of course a back in the day to it never it never hurts him when he brought along the likes of Bruce Springsteen or what have you but uh he's got to be in Wisconsin later in the week to on friday to a campaign on behalf of or a Democrat so we are definitely getting a lot of attention this week\nAnd I think that Joe Biden if he's going to be a Wisconsin but he's a he's a on the trail as well and he and he has a Joe Biden also it just it whether you like his politics to\nKeep all like once you get popcorn sit back and watch\nWith

that I like to do the you know the end of October early top hampers put my Christmas lights up\nYes it's a good time Seattle weather's\nNice ... you're not out there that the chords are like frozen solid your fingers are not frozen solid you don't have to turn them on yeah\nYou know nobody knows there up until you turn them on so\nWhile Miller nice things have to worry about slippery surface Iraqis are climbing out\nLadders yeah it's just a lot safer and the weather's better for it I think\nI took it and that's and that's continued hanging or that so much lights but ornaments like ah like crazy lately\nAt the store yeah not at home now but that is that is a really good advice to get the lights up do you guys you at now is a good\nTime to check your light to to see what you have what needs to be repaired what you need to replace and all of the lights that we have\nUm are in good so you know so we've got I don't know eleven colors of ... and we do have some incandescent but not a time um people are more are slowly replacing\nAnd uh we've got some really cool new lights from Europe I put up a string of icicles on Saturday new icicle lights sixty six foot long and rats all the way around the collectible room I just kept hitting it to the ceiling and it just kept going and going and going\nAnd it's got um five hundred lights on it and it's like Seventy bucks\nNice sets peel

feet you could probably do your entire front of your house with one strain\nThat is very nice and I got to assume with some of the you know people don't may not know but like ... ... they're insanely efficient lonely\nEfficient and they last a really long time the only thing with the ladies that I'm a rep told me last year which I found kind of interesting was it if you use timers and a lot of people use timers on especially on their outdoor light mhm\nThat really what you need to do is invest in a timer that is compatible for ...\nThe regular analog timers there's like they hold the power and then there's a little surge which will sometimes caused the ladies to sort of malfunction a little bit it doesn't seem like it's a lot of power stored up but Eli these use so little\nThat so sometimes if you're if you have ... outside and they're kind of acting up and you use a timer that's might be why so there it's more expensive time are for sure but it'll make your lights last longer\nI Wonder too 'cause like I'm a I'm a home automation kind of ... can you can get now for next to nothing outlets that will connect with the euro ... smart system\nWe do have the we have we got
