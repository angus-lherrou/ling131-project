benefits and we're going to talk a little bit about that today the blood pressure the heart rate the healing loose or just a mind over matter we have science to back it up\nWhat what kind of it for people who may not I think we've all seen yoga and me but a lot of us have done yoga what exactly is it I mean what kind of how do we define yeah\nGreat question and of course it's going to be a few different definitions but up to about Thirteen million adults in America and are practicing yoga and it continues to increase uh sixty percent of Americans uh we'll do this because they think that this has health benefits and it does overall wellbeing\nA over a quarter or more doctors and now even recommending it as part of their treatment plans for specific medical conditions back pain or any kind of pain blood pressure heart related issues\nOr things like that but really yoga itself it's not just um like we talked about earlier a jet I mind trick it's really\nA practice for the mind and body and of course it has those origins in you know if you look at Indian a kind of\nTextbooks in philosophy they were sort of the geniuses and invented this practice but like any other meditative process it's basically movement of the body for health purposes\nTo maximize whether it's your energy or physiological breathing posture relaxation overall can just be great for the mind as well as the body\nAre you seeing if it for a lot of people they think oh I've got a I've got to take a class or about 'em is yoga something in in ... as far as even some of the more basic stuff is that some people can obviously with technology now can they learn stuff on their own\nAbsolutely we use technology in so many wonderful ways right to watch our favorite sports teams to watch our favorite reality TV stars but let's not forget all the great health benefits you can also get from technology so whether it's a free app on your phone watching a Youtube video\nOf course consult your doctor before beginning any health regimen but you're a great resources available at either low cost or no cost they really there's no excuse it's not that we have to get to a class or or get to that beach front to do that yoga\nIt can be done right in the comfort of your own home or at your office of course it has a powerful effect um and I know we're going to talk a little bit about\nVery very good stuff talking with Dr Madeira mirror this morning from as a melt talking about yoga and all the great benefits of and let's talk about specifically some of those benefits you you alluded to a couple earlier but the I mean the very widespread as far as uh as far as the great benefits to yoga\nYes and so there are multiple studies some focus just on men women children stress levels we always talk about cortisol I took a quarter of all that's our stress hormone the hormone that\nAnd it causes a cascade of reactions maybe the increase heart rate blood pressure adrenaline so on and so forth to so many studies have now supported that really\nJust performing yoga even for a week or three months immediately those cortisol levels lower and if we romantically or lowering does or does all levels that than shows decrease levels of stress anxiety fatigue depression and who doesn't want that stuff\nI mean in today's day and age everything is stressful everything is a rush rush situation and so if we can decrease any of that in mind and body health will benefit\nAnd Dr we talk about a quarter of all I Know we we brought it up on a on some previous shows as well um there there's really connection there with the with higher levels and higher stresses that is that what you guys she\nExactly so when you hear cortisol think stress thing okay when I get stressed at work or I'm sitting in traffic what's going on it's that or does also we have to really learn how to utilize this cortisol to benefit us as well as to minimize it so that we can not let the corners I'll take control of us\nSo by minimizing that orders all by decreasing ended that stress reaction or decreasing our heart rate think about being stuck in traffic we're all subject to that immediately immediately your heart rate increases your blood pressure is increasing got a headache your mood is\nIs bad that maybe you get angry on top of that so there's a whole cascade of things that happened imagine if we can just take a moment take a deep breath even just taking a deep breath or ten seconds to mindfulness techniques that's part of yoga\nTalking with Dr Madeira merit system healthier thirteenth ...

physical health um\nThere's also some great benefits when it comes to helping people with chronic pain as there is there evidence to show that that's actually true\nYes and so I Know as I give this segment today I'm biased because I Am a Yogi or at least a yoga fans are but there is science behind this it's not just you know because Dr Mehra likes it so there's great science that supports it decreases chronic pain and there's a number of a scientific philosophical reasons that does that\nNumber one all the great ... a cardiac benefits number two the rest tried benefits muscle benefits core strengthening\nIncreasing flexibility ah talking about all the football teams that are now incorporating this into their ah practices and making it mandatory not only that but of course it decreases stress decreases anxiety people are sleeping better and when we talk about chronic pain there is that is it going and mental aspects when\nWe discuss things like yoga you're really tackling both aspects what could be better\nIf there's something to as we're talking I'm In the last segment about some of the ... you know there are a ... as much as it may not always look or appear to be physically tasking it depending on your level you can do some extremely challenging goals is is there something would be said for building some of the muscle and core strength the\nKind of support the the the bone structures and those things\nAbsolutely and I took my husband will be upset when he hears this but you know he's he's a dude right plays hockey and he worked at the gym and across it and I said listen\nHaving badgering you for a couple of years come to one yoga class me and he came to one and I have to say he admitted that was tougher than I thought you know and I definitely broke a sweat ten minutes and the class and maybe that squad where we have to hold our hands\nHolding that one stationary pose triggered the loose in the back in the core and abdominal ... and\nYou're just stimulating these muscles that you don't normally use and he admitted okay and cross that I Do this that and the other and I do that lifts and that this simulated muscles the next day so I didn't know I had those muscles or now so they don't underestimate it it's not just for men are for women are for children it's\nReally for anyone just finding that that works for you\nAbsolutely fascinating talking with Dr Madeira America here on weekend wellness brought you buy ss somehow I'm Dr you mentioned a little bit about chronic pain and and kind of what it does to your brain what what's going to break down and get a little more into that it was kind of what we're seeing as far as\nSome of the study used when it comes to using yoga treat chronic point man what are we what do we know they're\nSo what we know and this is a very oversimplified explanation but when we think of stressful situations physiologically stressful or emotionally mentally stressful we think of gray matter shrinking no you need to know as we like gray matter gray matter is good for us it lets us work at a higher level and function and neuron connectivity but if we have\nHigh blood pressure super stressful situations chronic pain depression that gray matter starts atrophy and shrinking\nIt's almost killing itself off in some ways and and as debates as to why in the process but\nWhen we think of yoga it actually does the opposite we're looking at gray matter perhaps rolling or at least maintaining to look at those two processes as different as there's actual science now an imaging that supports decreasing the stress increasing our\nPhysical uh competence actually increases that gray matter so any physical activity not just yoga will support gray matter health in neuron house\nThat is interesting I guess I don't think I've ever heard anybody\nIt's good for the mind and body said get out there and go for a walk at the heart rate up whether it's play football do yoga or just a mindfulness it's good for your brain\nWell talk about them the overhaul overall safety of yoga and I you know obviously depending on your age or maybe some um other health concerns is is yoga something that's truly for everybody\nIt can be for everybody or any we talk about kids doing it in the class in grade school now we talk about or Ninety two year old patients that just as you do at the YMCA some basic yoga classes and they are more flexible and more together than some of my six year old patients because they're just using the body and that healthy way\nSo yes it can be for everybody but the nice thing is again I'm like my husband that plays hockey and there's\nA helmet and there's sticks and years and all this stuff that's pretty expensive you really don't need much for yoga you need your body you need a map perhaps even even do it in a chair it's relatively low cost um it's relatively low impact so we're talking healthy\nFor the joints or if you've suffered an injury or if you're like me and my current state of pregnancy you can still do it it's one of those safe things that you just find something that it's for you for your body your lifestyle and it's relatively safe so\nLike we keep saying or shall we say this all the time it's always about just getting out there and doing it ... it can all talk about it you can listen to the segment but make a difference today go with a friend go with a family member just try something different whether it's a YouTube or class just get out there and do it\nAnd what it wants to talk about that actually doctor is um when it comes to yoga I think one of the things that may scare people off is the unknown is right I I I've seen it or I've heard of it\nUm ... you mentioned kids now learning about in gym class I think for a lot of us listening right now we never had that so right it can it can make it intimidating what are some you know what are some of the things that are the people need to me to think about when they're hearing us to talk about yoga\nRight and the reason we always say that phrase is talk to your doctor first is again before beginning any health medical treatment plan\nCheck with your doctor and say what what are some options for me knowing my risk factors and knowing my current state of physical being once you've spoken to your doctor then they can tell you what low impact strategies what limitations you have um also ... the benefits that it would have for you so I think again when we think of yoga we think of\nYou know someone with a perfect body with this really flexible\nBasically positions and things they can do and that's not all that it is it's it's much wider it has a lot of different mind body benefits that we've covered today as well as the fact that it's low impact low risk for really major injuries it's pretty rare\nHear someone say well I I was doing a a basic yoga class and now I have suffered some major injury yes with any exercise program their injuries that are possible and you can overdo it but it's less common than perhaps the football the hockey some of the other sports that we talk about\nIn one of the things that that I've noticed as as you mentioned that it's becoming more common I'm seeing a lot of more opportunities for ... for beginners whether it's at right here a gym membership or I Know there's there's just groups that get together and teach each other yoga it's it's a very\nNot only are they are are are they accepting their very much encouraging people to let's get go and join us it's a very\nUm almost supportive environment and community and and so even that aspect makes you feel so connected and I think in today's day and age\nWe're all connected via technology but we're all very disconnected [laughter] and so again getting back to the health benefits and why it benefits us imagine getting out to a class even just once a week and in a room full of people are all kinds of going through the same journey together and and\nThe nice thing is that almost every yoga teacher I've ever met says don't compare yourself to your neighbor comparison is the chief of happiness [laughter] it's a really compare yourself to your body what's happening on your Matt\nShine you can probably do things I Can't do and vice versa so\nYou just get out there and do what's best for you\nI can nap anywhere [laughter] I have fallen asleep and some yoga classes I Will admit that we would go yoga stuff have you seen that I've seen\nIt I have not tried it and the cat yoga goat yoga is so many different versions out\nThere of your dog can be other people and sometimes the animal joining yellow ... thank you so much for your time you have a great weekend\nIt was a pleasure to have a mindful day
