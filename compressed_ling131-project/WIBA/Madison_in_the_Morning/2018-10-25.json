say\nWhat are they talking about last week maybe I missed it you can of course listen to the podcast that class financial dot com as mentioned we're going to talk about uh about debt and let's talk or get kind of going when you guys help people you know when it comes to planning for retirement there's that kind of issue that comes up which is the amount of debt that people carry on their on their balance\nSheet I Would assume that that's part of that are part of that important conversation\nIsn't it [laughter] it is we we talk quite a bit about this on the show and we would we would like on ourselves a quite a bit too to Dave Ramsey approaches it pertains to debt\nI'm so so Dave Ramsey for those who don't know is is kind of this finance gurus that focuses on helping people uh pay down debt and and live their lives free free of these cash flow constraints so debt and you think about it in preparation for retirement debt\nTakes your income right again let me read that that takes your income so if you have a mortgage or a car payment or if you have student loans you have these required payments that the bankers or institutions are obviously take from you\nAnd so if you are approaching retirement what do we want to do what we want to free up your cash flow as much as possible so that it doesn't take you as much to comfortably live your life style\nSo set another way we have some clients who have sixty fifty sixty thousand dollars a year of retirement income and yet they tell us they are living very comfortably in retirement we have others who have two to three hundred thousand dollars a year of retirement income and they feel constrained and they're living paycheck to paycheck\nSo let me ask listeners what's the difference between those two and the answer is that one has required outflow so even though they have a lot of income they don't feel very comfortable another has less income but no debt and so they live comfortably so\nSet up a plan we would encourage you if you really want to get a good posturing or kind of a good wreak rework of how you should look at that listen to Dave Ramsey here's something called financial peace University He's written three or four different books on this particular topic\nListened to him and he will help to reorient how basically the world is driven by by banks and financial institutions that are marketing so heavily to you to use their debt that we we start to morph are realities Dave Ramsey will help you read that reality\nSometimes in a slightly offensive away but he's he has a great his principles are good you mentioned the fact\nIs is is is very simple\nWay of handling dead as we've got three words which is dead is dumb yeah exactly and he said dumb and stupid and you're in quite a bit but you know what I appreciate it uh that's that's his job as a as a kind of shocked people into realizing what they're doing\nA and then you know some people ask us okay I get it I Need to focus on eliminating dead or limiting it at least by the time I get to retirement but what about saving for retirement versus paying down that and which ones should take priority\nAnd so we like to give rules of thumb the rule of thumb should be any high interest or an secure that should always be priority number one to eliminate\nThen becomes retirement savings and so on and so forth but again I Would just focus on Dave Ramsey he has some really great principals he calls them baby steps\nOn building up a small emergency reserve than attacking your high interest credit card debt eliminating anything besides a mortgage\nThen saving about Fifteen Percent the retirement so he has some really great rules of thumb that we would basically abide by\nThe only one we would be slightly different on would be we want people to always take advantage of the match that their employer offers on a four one K. plan because usually that matches up to three four percent of your income\nAnd it's not going to make a huge difference in your debt elimination anyways but again I couldn't go one way or another depending upon who the individual is so again try to do both but focus on debt elimination first\nAnd one of the things do if you do have that matching\nOpportunity that's literally giving yourself a raise if you're not taking it you're literally getting more money yeah it's a great opportunity there
