they can choose to go to for their checkups\nOh okay so yeah about three dozen I imagine you have quite a few in rock counties as well\nYes we do an absolutely free\nYup there's no co pays now premiums now deductibles for eligible women I does cover an office visit with the pap test how they kicked them breast exam and then after the mammogram\nAuthor free oh let me ask you hear a an eligible um what do you do to be eligible\nTo be eligible women need to be with our insurance or insurance that does not cover a mammogram\nThere's also an income eligibility which for example for a household size that one a woman could earn up to thirty thousand three hundred and fifty dollars annually and still be eligible for the program\nInsurance does I thought all insurance covered mammograms but some don't\nWell there's some loopholes still out there yeah most do because it's a the a cover and you've been there are some plans out there still that word grandfathered in and have other loopholes and so they're still women who have insurance to do need the program\n[noise] you know and we're we're talking about women it is a that Wisconsin well woman program\nUm but what about men you know a ... I'm ... I had breast cancer and I carried the gene from my father's side and we hear that the men men they're obviously not as often as women but can't get breast cancer\nAbsolutely men can definitely get breast cancer and I'm really glad you brought that up we need to keep bringing that to the forefront and reminding men that is important for them to get a check up if they do suspect something unusual\nUnfortunately for this program which is a federal program through the Centers for Disease Control we are not able to scream and through this program but there is another program locally um that we can refer them to if we get calls from men\nOkay fantastic and just kind of curious I Do do men get regular mammograms that a woman would\n[noise] um yeah I'm not a clinician set on us [laughter] directly but um there there are men that have gotten mammograms their self breast ultrasound they're also some other tests that can be done for men\nSure okay well that's good to know and as far as your traditional mammogram has has there been any ah any changes I I thought that there were some uh some new version of a of a less invasive sort of mammogram\nWhile most health systems now arguing the three D. mammography that is becoming the standard um and I believe there's only one house system here in ... county that's not doing three day I'm One of the things that's still happening with the three\nDay is that in many insurances are not covering them a hundred percent so there is going to be a co pay out of pocket for women who want to go ahead and get the three day on and there's a lot of work being done right now by many different\nGroups trying to get insurance to cover this three day a hundred percent\nOkay I I guess probably goes without saying that to your three D. mammography is better than the old standard\nYes that is what research is showing\nAnd to help out with um the the Wisconsin well woman program um ... does it offered the three D. or is it the traditional\nYes the wild and then program covers three D. mammography\nOh okay that's good so let's say you do have insurance but it's not a covering that a three D. mammogram\nA while and then program OK\nYeah now unfortunately\nNot and now is a curious this are being offered just through the month of October or does a program offered the screening throughout the year\nYeah the ... program has been in Wisconsin for twenty five years it's a very well established program it's like I said a state wide program there are regional coordinators it is a program that goes on three hundred and sixty five days a year\nAnd so it it's a great program and I'm like I said it's very well established though generally women have a very good experience coming through the wall and then program they work with the coordinator in their region coordinator help set them up with a health care provider if they don't already have one\nUm and then we also provide follow up in case management so any woman who screened through this program um of course ticketing clinical follow up on the house the stump side but they're also getting case management follow up through a coordinator through the program\nOn which has just double checked to make sure that they're getting any follow up services on that they might need\nBecause obviously we know a win caught early ... it's a very curable disease and I have for a lot of women uh money is the obstacle here\nYes it definitely is um and you know even the changes in in care ability from the last ten years it it's really amazing on just the new technologies and as clinicians are researchers are finding out more and more\nAbout the different types of breast cancer and how to specifically target treatment for each\nPackers quarterback Aaron Rodgers revealed that he reintroduce left me and the loss of Detroit and we'll keep worrying that protected brace\nApparently Rogers dealing with more than just as Neal though Mike mccarthy didn't provide specifics that coach also says he still has confidence and veteran kicker Mason Crosby Louis for field goals that are P.

is fine when no after day\nAnd one of the things I remember from last week's show and talking with you about tax rates is is we are kind and for people who say well all you know I'll Wait you know maybe next year a few years to come\nUm we're in an interesting spot is is obviously we are at an amazingly low um low tax rates right now a lot of the projections builder coming back saying uh you know in the future of the taxes may pick up a bit so you're kind of in that\nIn that kind of gold an area of uh of where taxes are right now\nI mean I think most experts are going to tell you that they think they're going up and I mean one of those experts\nGoes as baby boomers are aging is putting more stressed right on Social Security Medicare Medicaid\nOr the federal debt is that about Twenty one trillion dollars so you know how are we going to pay for all these things it's likely that they're going to have to pay through taxes so in my opinion you know take advantage of of what we have right now if you can if it makes sense for you\nAs Tracy says a golden opportunity for your golden years all you got to do is scheduled appointment Tracy she loves to talk with you are going to do is get the T Anton investment house dot com that spelled T A N T O N investment house dot com cell phone number ... five zero one Fifteen for nine that's six or eight\nFive zero one Fifteen for nine and Tracy a lot of times when we talk about great things are great opportunities to putting\n... for someone else is this something when it comes to the uh converting a two way raw IRA is that something that anyone can do\nYeah the reality is is actually everyone does it matter what your income level is can convert to a raft IRA and this kind of a change because a number of years ago it used to be that your adjusted gross income had to be less than a hundred thousand in order for you to be able to\nQualify to convert so now anybody can convert\nAnd when you look at like can anyone contribute no that's a different conversation so if you want to contribute to a Roth IRA and say you're married filing jointly your modified adjusted gross income has to be a hundred and Ninety nine thousand or less\nIn order for you actually to contribute to a raft IRA so you know ... um conversion is a different question than ... contributing really\nAnd I I don't know that I may maybe we have brought that up I Would I'd never heard that that second part but that's that is interesting as as we're talking to about conversions as well with Roth IRA that no matter where you are on that um that's\nUm it's something that you can do now one of the nice things with Tracy is so over the numbers were the ones say is it something you should do now obviously the\nBig broad wisdom is definitely it's a it's a great opportunity but the nice thing is with Tracy is it's personalized and she wants to get to know you just get the website the Anton investment ... dot com or pick up the phone give Tracy ... six to eight five zero what Fifteen for nine\nSix awake five zero one Fifteen for nine and along those lines of course Tracy is the big question of okay everyone can do it\nTo everyone can burn a Rob IRA off from a traditional\nAren't so fast [laughter] well they say the number one rule is that if you don't have the money to pay the tax outside of your IRA you should not convert since you do not want to use area money to pay the tax um since you do that tax rate on that distribution and if you're under age fifty nine and a half\nYou'd have a penalty in addition to the tax so they say you have to have the money outside the Ira and then beyond that you should also like let's say you had money that was outside of an IRA but it you would have short term capital gains rates because perhaps you owned an investment less than a year well\nYou should end to sell you or a non retirement money to do that because you're going to have to pay taxes again at ordinary income tax rates on the game so if you have something that you've owned for over a year and you get long term capital gains rates yes use that money and and pay the tax again if it makes it makes sense\nAnd sometimes people do how do I know and that's I think one of the things too is why you know worked with a certified financial planner to get these type of answers to go okay like that I like that but what about me that's the importance of working with someone like you isn't it\nYeah I mean the big thing is is when you come in\nI pretty much know a lot about it and then I also ask and I see your taxes and people say well why do you want to see my taxes like every once in a while actually find an air and me is is that I Want to see is conversion makes sense for you what tax bracket are you in now and

to worry about so again it has to make sense but\nYou know in her case well what could these dollars grow to and again I'm kind of thinking about it not just from her life lifetime but also her kids

have a good understanding of what your income will be for the year and you'll probably have enough cash outside with outside funds to cover the conversion\nI wouldn't wait too long and December because that's just a really busy time of the air for the investment house as well as other houses right and so\nI'm most financial institutions are busy doing here and stuff so you know make sure you get it in before I'd say mid December\nAnd as we're talking today to about ... and maybe people got started thinking last week to 'em and they're saying I really I'm really ... and this is is it for

recently they're under age sixty five and they were buying subsidize health insurance on the public exchange and so if you look at conversion for them their income would increase and therefore\nThe amount that they'd have to pay and premium um are the amount that they would we see them premium assistance from the government would go down substantially so in that case we decided not to do conversion\nVery good and that's really quick up for Iraq out of here this morning um any risks when it comes to a converting to ... well the potential\nRisk that you have is that in the future after you've converted you're going to be paying at the lower rate right so like you converted you paid at a higher rate and later your taxes are lower but again like we've talked about historically taxes are really low and so what is the likelihood of that\nBut again you have to look at your own situation and and really decide but I think you know if you could convert\nAnd then later you know pay no
