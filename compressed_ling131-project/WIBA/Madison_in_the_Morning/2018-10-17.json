I may have missed inflation certain parts on certain days all\nThe time we go in at ... in fact we go into a lot of new homes and very new homes home some homes that were literally just moved into and they're [noise]\nMaybe the way the mechanical is was set up there's over sites and you know how they ran certain duct work through the addict can didn't insulated properly didn't seal it properly um\nA lotta times new homes there's no air sealing done you know so if you are building a home or going to buy a new home that's something you need to look at\nDid they just go up and spray some insulation up in the attic or did they actually air seal everything properly\nBefore they put the insulation and so yeah we're doing that all the time were but we've sucked insulation out of homes that were less than a year old air sealed and read the whole thing because it just wasn't done properly so\nStack effect was huge you pick a homeless three stories and with no air sealing done I'm On all of the electrical runs on on duct work on a chimney run it's ah it makes for a\nBad situation so\nYeah so even if you've got a newer home or a brand new home their spots in your house that are uncomfortable let Dr energy saver solve the problem for you and at the end or points out this is not just that it will throw some more inflation on an old for the best it is it is a process there

groups as well as some gutters are really quickly Andrew with Dr energy saver um you guys work with focus on energy and um for people who don't know folks on energy and they're an independent\nThird party they are they're actually part of the power companies a ... that's their business to make sure and their their auditing you they are making sure that that you're doing great work\nYeah it it's kind of a weird concept right so actually that that is correct the power company actually puns most of this\nAnd people like that doesn't make sense well it does ah it's actually the they've done they've done the statistics they've done the studies and realize that it's it's cheaper for them to give homeowners money to make their homes more efficient\nThan it is to build more power plant um because of the need doesn't go down but if they can help homeowners save a little money I make in their homes more efficient were there\nYou know cutting their energy costs by twenty thirty forty percent a year ah it it it makes sense for them so yes we do that for a couple of reasons first reason is because that money's there ... and we want home want us to be able to take advantage of it\nSecondly and while I feel the most important reason we use it is for that third party validation\nOr when they are going to ... they come into the home after we sell the job I have a signed contract they are going to come in take a look at exactly what we're going to be doing they're going to figure out through their computer program after they do actually a full blown off and on your home\nUm what type of money we're going to be saving the homeowner that year and that's what the rebate is going to be based on\nNow in the work is done and they come back in recheck everything make sure that it's up to par if it's not we got to come back because sometimes we miss stuff\nOr if you've ever been in your attic\nHopefully haven't um it it's a it's kind of a different world up there so things can be missed it's hard to find stuff especially if it's covered in insulation and and um sometimes they find that and we didn't we go back and take care of it so you\nKnow not only is the work done well but it's signed off on to say it is done well there's an independent correct\nIn order to get that in order to get that focus money it has to be done properly they happen to be ... they have to know a hundred percent that the savings that they calculated are actually going to be achieved [noise] um because if it's not then while they're giving away money and wasting it and so yeah it's a it it's good for everybody to talk of everybody\nTalking with Andrew Larson of ourselves services talking about Dr energy saber again if you've got uncomfortable place you're home whether this
