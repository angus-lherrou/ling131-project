I Hope we you know he's paying the bill\nYou put me in a tough spot dance wise that and I'm going to defend the president right now\nUh he announced the day after he was elected he was he launched his reelection campaign so all of these campaign rallies are should be reimbursed\nBy the campaign now if they're not I I Would be outraged but I think I have a pretty good feeling that that sense he is a declared candidate for twenty twenty that if he's doing campaign rallies his campaign is paying for these things and if that's the games are\nSo they're all that and also I mean that that that's part of the part of the privilege of of being president I see a lot of people criticizing as a a a Rolling Stone or who just did the the the breakdown of Mike Pence a visit to\nWatch the introduction for the Colts game and people are just hundreds and thousands of dollars for a political smart as part of the deal you can't you\nYou you can't tell these elected officials hey we've elected you to these positions that demand high security demand high rises rations and then we're going to criticize you when the bill is high I think it's it you you ... it's it's it's cost of doing business if you have a president or vice president or their families there is a cost to having\nThat ... those positions and and that's fine\nAnd you know ... you're right about the security you don't have itself because Trump has offered the secret service a few times 'cause he he didn't understand the other reality what security had\nA he said listen I got a pretty nice jumbo jet I'll I'll use that one if you want like actually when you can't you're the leader of the free world and we have technology on air force one and we have um protections on air force one that we you know the public will never know about but if you're a jet that snakes up on air force one\nYou're going to pay a very very Supreme severe price or even without escort jets\nAre they are equipped to do some very very nasty things that they have to protect themselves\nUm and and I also President Trump is donating his paycheck or I don't think he's taken the time and pay\n'em so I Would not be shocked if the if the campaign or righteously filling out a check I'm yeah I'm sure they're very diligent about that because the media will actually do their job when it comes to Mr Trump\nUm so yeah I I you know what that is a reasonable response ...\nUm and again I I I I Believe the president deserves security second to none I Do believe that the senators and Congress people out there who are getting threatened I guess what got to pay the overtime bill now and you got a Capitol police in secret service and now I've got to be involved with this\nUm because of Democrats behavior because if Democrats communist behavior that's\nReality now people getting threatened on Twitter sending a videos of beheadings um I I don't know how the Democrat Party is going to deal with this I really don't because they have to deal with this if Cortez is the future of your party Mitch court cases damn near functionally illiterate or she is not a sharp gap\nYou need to be a sharp couch she's not\nDemocratic Party what are you going to do now spike in the ... at a rally and all that stuff I I Want a victory going into\nNovember I Want a big victory and I do believe the Democrats have lost their I go to the NPR PBS poll\nDemocrats have lost all their lead it's a it's a neck and neck reality now let's let's get a win thirty four pack the hour that is the one and only showing people this is the day a comedy show news talk Thirteen Ken WMBA\nNews radio I'm only in lieu [noise]\nAfter having us official confirmation the protests continue now tonight at the White House the president's second Supreme Court justice get a ceremonial swearing in\nOnce he is seen it on the bench justice Kevin I Will hear a number of high profile cases this week including those involving firearms immigration and asbestos exposure by with that case on immigration involves the custody and detained bit of an illegal alien who was actually about to be deported that one will be obviously very closely walk is Kevin\n... tropical storm Michael off the Yucatan Peninsula could become a hurricane tonight or tomorrow and threaten the Florida Panhandle possibly by mid week and Facebook launching its first get branded electronic device it's a screen and camera equipment gadgets called\nFrom a health cooperative\nHe's continuing\nFor news talk through\nDo you why be a\nGood morning I'm Gerry bell the brewers are headed the national league championship series Milwaukee no wage there next postseason alone is they'll face you've a Dodgers or the Braves at Miller Park friday night [noise]\nGovernor Walker's father is died the\nGovernor announced the news on Twitter the journal sentinel reported ...
