Ah yes\nHey by the way you and I will be stuck here until Wednesday morning cabinet it's just that the um I don't think there's any gave me the idea that it's a again let let's kick off the conversation we started yesterday perhaps I Am and regrettably were both in agreement on this\nOr that I think it's a push right now I'm ... I think uh neither side has an overwhelming lead on anything um and it it's just the you know to me uh the work is really going to come down to a\nA ... I think knocking on doors and campaigning and and shaking hands and and getting out there and and and offering what you believe in\nAnd I appreciate the fact that Tony ... came out and made that statement yesterday thanks thanks be to God [laughter] it's we say and and the economy has a case for me to God and uh ... nothing different that I heard on October\nThird it's if he wants to sign you up you want you to registry oh oh he's mentally ill let's go get his guns at last time I checked not mentally ill or excuse me not illegal to be mentally ill see that you could tell when I get annoyed priests around here that if you take smashed my head against the wall hold on one minute thank\nYou I don't know if you don't conceal\nIt and you don't you don't hide any any type but when when something rubs me the wrong way you got your pretty open about\nIt again and and maybe I'm maybe I'm confused was there [noise]\nDo we can do I don't think there's any new revelations I Know is is because like things like and and the other thing too that I'm Wondering what are we equating things like universal background checks with the registration of firearms or or is is the Tony ... and maybe I'm completely\nBecause everything I saw he never mentioned registration of firearms is and I know I'm kind of picking on that one point but did he say something somewhere where he actually said I support registration of firearms or deeds initially say I I you know I when it comes wrong or\nMeasures okay longer myself actually supports okay um\nAgain I even I mean if we get all the all of a Tony Evers making a brand new more sensational statement a well certainly uh we'll get that audio we'll play it for you no doubt\nAnd but it's there is nothing new here that it's time to work for my our candidates it's time to get up and say\nVote Governor Scott Walker vote to leave vote vote Glenn growth growth and\nAnd I've read a ... a a ... it's a if there's a lot of folks out there running nothing's that gave me here I Do believe or a there'll be some gains for the Democrats in the house but I Do believe there's a chance for us to maintain the majority\nUm there is a I think there's an unusual change in the Senate I think the Senate has the potential actually pick up some seats and become more of a more significant majority in the Senate I think that's possible are you now have New Jersey that's in play\nAnd how ... still has a job in the United States Senate is beyond me why don't the Democrats ... drum out their own\nWe went a Republican does something outrageous\nAll of the leadership gets up he needs to resign please resigned please resign and please go away a lot of them don't go away but they get voted out the next election\nUm\nI and I go back to the tenor on the tone I go back to what are the defending of a of a friends what used to be friends out there we had a call yesterday and she pointed out that her sister completely disowned or on Facebook\nI'm not giving up my family members for the sake of a\n[noise] and um we have somebody reporting now that the ... the the new statements that they did get was on the morning show out and W I send our colleague Jay whether I'm In a more sensational again that might be audio out there and will pick it up we get 'em\nAnd it but it's nothing new I mean that's the point I'm trying to make it it's nothing new at this as who they are this is what they believe in uh go to the October third statement that said that sprint that right now you'll see that\nThere I'm all for pain and guns yeah I Want you know I I look nice John registration and and as a concealed carry a I got ... yeah that's what he wants to your guns that is what he wants that is what it boils down to\n... you mentioned you mentioned the ... you know the the shake it kind of how things are shaking\nOut in the Senate and I I I I I stand by and we've got a we've got a friendly wage around the house but on the Senate side I think you're right on the news I I think whether it's North Dakota Missouri air as well and Arizona's already are already Republican I especially a North Dakota Indiana that says\nIn North Dakota Missouri in Indiana are kind of the three where you're looking right now going All right there's a\nThere's a chance that a democratic incumbent both North Dakota in Missouri or would lose two Republican which would to get a ... a a a plus for for Republicans\nAnd I've been looking at West Virginia though because Joe Manchin has a very very popular guy and when I'm and he's now behind in that race because he I voted to confirm Kavanaugh just for that one reason alone um\nIt it it's interesting he's Democrats are walking away from that is why he was dropped the lead in that state\nI'm again I'm not saying it's a massive are leading Joe Manchin once again I'll say is a very very popular guy in that in West Virginia I'm not saying anything is a slam dunk with him\nBut the but the dynamic has changed um and I think that's the first time in his recorded history in West Virginia that he's behind in a race that they he normally win pretty handily um\nI Would put money on Joe Manchin Lynn like cash money [laughter] I I think I think he's going to wear a lecture and I think I think he's got a um is a more see I think is the guy that ah ... who's done very well done very you know done quite well and there's obviously I think\nThe whole cabinet things change the dynamic though which is interesting\nI'm I'm\nAgain it'd be for cabinet I'd do it I'd be right there with you I said yeah Joe Manchin a slam dunk I really believe there's going to be a cabinet dynamic I didn't think it was going to last a historically I didn't think I ... after the confirmation you and I both know or you know five days is a lifetime between a point I Am point B when it comes to an issue um\nI I just think of it and and it shouldn't be down if you think I'm wrong here I Believe that Brett Kavanaugh um debacle or the disgrace and and and the uh the false accusations and they the BS testimony and ... especially I think he's a factor in\nYou know this this degenerate this degenerate just weighed in with their sweat hog and by the way NBC held back a\nCooperative evidence for Mr capital ... there was a a there was a a as a second individual from um uh unless we one of the party sit down with ... you know as Brett Kavanaugh never did this and and they held back that testimony or that statement I should say\nUm so I Would you believe that the cabin always and historically a right up until next Tuesday\nI think it's I think it does I think it absolutely uh is is a very very um\nBig it\nI guess what I'm saying it galvanized member of the never Trump crowd\nAnd like you fired right back he will not holding any party like what do you mean by that you know there was something that I've talked to my I'm like dude you'll never hear a ... that's the exact phrase you'll never hear a ... and by God you never did that day I got to make sure I write this stuff correctly from Ellen [laughter]\nIt's like I'm having too much fun grapes it's a you know this life is on and it

I mean should we should we reexamine birthright citizenship should we reexamine that process I mean the idea that that all you got to do is\nBe born in this country and that could be the only moments of your life you've ever been to a nation but you're a citizen of that country I think if you ask a lot of people around the world at St that's outrageous like Lakewood that go on and on any other country but because of our our history and because of um where we where we ban and how we built ourselves it was a necessity\nBut there again we're ... we're gonna have to go back to what it was a captive the amendment and and that's clearly laid out and most transcripts what this Braves is driving that is\nSubject to the jurisdiction there or if I come here illegally from Mexico I'm not subject to the jurisdiction ride states I'm a Mexican citizen subject to their jurisdiction that's what this gift that it's\nNow ...\nAllies and you're also subject to the jurisdiction\nBut there's there has been rulings there had been rulings that are those\nWho are here even potentially illegally or if they're if they're standing on the soil of the United states they get certain constitutional protections protections whether we like it or not and a lot of the get ... a a litigation\nAs a flush that out and uh I I get I'm with you you know I've Bruce I'm with you I mean common sense should prevail here no doubt about it\nUm but the fact is the legal and this is why I like a good legal argument I watch good attorneys go back and forth\nI I think mark Martin live in is one of the most well on the legal minds in the country\nThat being said um this has been a debate for a long time and uh whether or not it's been answered definitively I Would say it hasn't I mean that's that's the reality and it's a but it raised good points we got to take a break forty nine past the hour Anthony will be next this is did encounter ratio news talk Thirteen tend WNBA\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member on and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that somebody can nothing to do with very much into well and you can definitely do with an act of Congress but\nThey're saying I can do it just was an executive order\n\nLooking for a ... dental insurance for yourself your family or business visit momentum plans dot com check out momentum insurance plans competitive rate much similar plans and announce standing network um didn't didn't\nVisit momentum blames dot com for a frequent based in Madison was serving Wisconsin momentum dental plans ensuring healthy smiles\nMomentum plans dot com [noise]\nThree years ago making a murderer became less a TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered rave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this ... trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding emerge\nReminding a murderer is now on the ...

I think it's a great point yeah but\nThink one of like trying to think of what the um what the percentage President Trump did or even Mitt Romney did better with him in ... with the Latino vote\n'em I I don't know that we're talking about it you know a significant number of of people that are for Republicans I think I I think what you're doing now is engaging those who might have you know might have lost some of that you know so much of the elections are about momentum and for those who may have lost momentum falling cabin on this re engages those individuals so I\nThink if you're [noise] I mean if if you're in Texas and seeing the even and I have a hard times Ted Cruz's and they do find\nAnything you don't want and if you look at his numbers with black and Hispanic voters they're going up to ... they've been going up pretty reliably when you look at the uh employment numbers now let's take a will take jumped and we have Anthony hey Jeff how I Want to get you in for the top of the aisle go right ahead\nGreetings from the banana republic Murray things\nI was I called and it was called in earlier and I had another call and shut your previous caller kind of a little bit of my wonder about the uh that freeze under the jurisdiction there I think that's right that's a key phrase but as I as I said here thinking about it you know your charters right this was a great political move because\nWhat is what is Trump what has he done so far with executive orders\nAnd particularly with Dr he's ...\nHe's reversed wherever he lay the blame Congress young guys you know who is approval rating is of heard of mining and as\nYou guys have Ron Paul you know Dr I'm Sorry that\nParents should I'll sign it and\nAnd he offered he offered one of the most uh a generous deals are where in the entire DACA debate he offered a path to citizenship is what they don't let it out\nAnd and I think ... percent of Americans I\nI agree with that and you know we can't deport how many millions or here but on the other hand give them a path to citizenship provided ...\nYou give us if you give us Fifteen Years of a productive a good members of society I think that that should be on the table I\nThis is down it's [laughter] you Bob good we broke\nIt Dan listen to us now I Believe was laid off and uh we'll give you rhetoric and will make money I Would make you dialed the phone every day\nAnd uh you know and one thing I appreciate about the vast majority costs of the show they are well thought out well reasoned and clearly a thinking a group of individuals here in Madison, Wisconsin and now part so far as well and we appreciate that so many people to weigh in on Facebook\nAs well and said please go to Dan ... CEO and or why Dan Connery on Facebook and Dan ... show on Facebook and uh we can engage in we even more it's a just a lot of people on the you know stuck at work\nAnd uh we have a you know some people we have\nA citizens who work for the government who are afraid to a dollar for referring to dial phones and yes we broke the or the counter there we are on some [laughter] why\nLooming out of the back a while ago and miss him too I think you ... and I pulled them out to just uh you don't cry like a baby that go ahead and smoke coming out the back and said plus\nPass man because it's a purely meat on that so that's a really good meter\nAnd then I really got to get out of the house will [laughter] three two one Thirteen tent three two one Thirteen than do we still have Anthony by the way darn right we\nAll right Anthony you take all the time you need my friend I'm going to have to hold you and consoled you because you might agree with President Donald Trump so let me get on your way to get out of your way and then you go right ahead good morning\nHey Dan ... thanks for taking my call I yeah I you know I I I Want to get out first and foremost I Do not agree with him travel in the ... I think it's I think that it's quite patently ridiculous the thing that you can use an EEO chains like I said\nI think it was Obama I think it will be explode and what their rights\nWell I better than that I I pointed that out there earlier in the show I said listen I had a lot of criticism of a President Obama so should not remain consistent I mean at least have the conversation anyway I'm Sorry go ahead Anthony\nThat being said I Want you want your Dan you're going to you're going to cause the thing is going to be ...\nI Want to watch your the the CNN undone and MSNBC on this and the talking heads look at what what those who are black what look at what those folks say look what the correctional black caucus will say about this\nAre if you if you see that the CBC is being quiet the elected black officials are being quiet you know that this is gonna be a deep and divisive wedge issue is is is smart to play because politics is zero sum game\nIn order to hurry up against the when Democrats have to lose and vice versa\nIf Trump is going to go out on this lemon say that\nAnybody that's an illegal immigrant regardless of if they come from Mexico or Canada or Russia or China\nYou don't get citizenship that well by Paul fits the actual medicine the black one in this country now yeah you know I'm all I'm all about making sure that black people are in a better position than they are currently you know what this\nWhat what do you think of the ... I I I hate to challenge your what do you think of the position that they're in right now black folks are in a position of but where do you think we're at right now as far as progress in a a good place\nTo the vast majority of blacks citizen in this country or for and when I say when I say for I mean cash for I mean well or I have no resources just based on data and\nAll right well I'm In Philly you and you would agree or\nIf you look at a uh a forty year period though I think black folks are really\nUm ah oh probably ... I think very very uh doing accent extremely well as compared to where they where they were on forty years ago would you agree with that\nData does not prove that the data proves based\nOff of the recession in two thousand and eight that ... that black people in this country have split further from where they weren't in the last home ownership a less good paying job\nOr didn't occur under Iraq Obama though then that occur under Brock Obama homeownership overall was decimated under ... Brock and has to be fair to be fair the housing bubble didn't serve that purpose either\n... or ... as you know black people are susceptible in this country to a fat\nDownturn yeah Danny downturn black yeah any downturn or black folks in Hispanic or minorities is clearly I got to get the first a feeling\nThat you're I won't I won't I disagree with you to say that that did that colonel bottom a lot but my point is what you will see is this will drive a wedge between those black voters that Democrat must get in order to win that like the office and the Latino vote or who they\nWho they can get but not in the same rights as that they can get black folks you seen it with Trump's election you seen it with Romney's election and you see McCain well McCain selection\nRight wow twenty percent on the Latino vote yup it there's no Republican in the country that's going to get twenty percent of the Bible is not going to have\nCan I ask you a ... I I can I be unfair to you today and can I ambushed you with a question um I did you hear Al Sharpton comment on the black Leadership Conference that took place in ... which by the way it was a four day event and these young black or leaders\nWere uh in the East Room in the White House and Donald Trump greeted them President Trump greeted them and Al Sharpton was really offended by the whole scene he thought black folks were getting used on this and he didn't like I thought it was one of the lowest of the low moments of the Trump presidency and I was wondering if you had to take on that\nI think anyone who can look at Al Sharpton and think that he speaks for anybody that up a thinking black person is badly mistake it\nAll right and that's all I'll say I'm Anthony Britain I go ahead\nWell go look at it and it goes to my point of for a look at all the talking heads are out of pocket but can you can look at these elected officials are and look at what they say you don't see I haven't really seen any of the black elected officials say anything about it no statements from the\nUm I I don't notice the water\nYou know as funny I've noticed the camping down a lot of the rhetoric over the last week and a half especially it's a I think it's a it's a but but uh the Anthony ... challenge me when I say that I think Al Sharpton is one of the greatest men in America because he made me a ton of all the time it was a cop [laughter]\nAnd [laughter] All right I'm ... I'm sure\nPolice have a a a welcoming relationship with with a rubber in Charlotte\nI got to tell you man he made he made a lot of cops a lot of money we were we you know what when when the cameras weren't there he was actually a very decent guy I Know sometimes we'd actually have some decent conversations he wasn't really bad to where they make I\nMake a lot of money from like whoa that's all I'll say\nAll right [laughter] oh humid that Anthony I appreciate the times and I appreciate the call as well three two one Thirteen ten three two one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten who do we want to get a next to Chico\nWho's been very very patient all I Want to never got rich Chico welcome my friend happy terrible Tuesday the day we got seven days rather go right ahead have at it though\nI wanted to address the um the I think it was either a I'm a tweet or an email that you got\nI was a of Facebook post or from Brendon or who was talking about the Hispanic impact ah but I don't know exactly\nWhat this isn't the first time that that this has happened um there was an influx of the civilians I think it crested in Nineteen twenty two and they had to make sure that they applied all the rules of citizenship as a matter of fact they were worried that they didn't have enough money to support themselves\nActually asked how much cash they had on him when they check them and when they did come to this country they were subject to arrest and they were subject to um all the laws under the constitution so to turn around and say well\nWe think that this was unfair to Hispanics because a lot of conservative which was kicks a span acts up there the fact of the matter is that every uh ethnic group\nShould come to America and should a I'm a big all the rule that everyone else says I don't care if they're if they dominate\nUm ... tells you something about the contract is an Oprah the richest a woman and I'm right never mind race and never mind or any other descriptor here I think she's the richest woman in America Oprah which doesn't mean\nWhich doesn't mean by the way that every black folk ... is a person is benefiting from that I'm just saying it's a I think this country's relatively fair and by the way\nOr the very first a lady millionaire and the United states a was a black woman from the DC and Baltimore area ms Walker a who is that it was she was black hair product\nAnd she was one of the first the movers and shakers in the United states for whom are concerned and ...
