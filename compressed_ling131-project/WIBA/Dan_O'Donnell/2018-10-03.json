after like whoa this is kind of blown up\nAnd uh but I'll tell you right up my dad warn me when I first came to Wisconsin He said well we'll we'll stop I got to have a conversation with your dad\nA and his best friend one of his best friends in the marine corps was from Milwaukee and he is do their best friend was from Minnesota\nFrom black duck Minnesota and my dad did management that you'd like he might as well have been a Canadian friend black duck Minnesota but he said he was a polish guy in a German Guy from Wisconsin and postcards from Minnesota and a German Guy was from Asia listen they got special filters on their livers\nThey can drink for three and four days\nNow everybody celebrates the Irish ability to drink beer the problem is is we drink for about a half a day we're looking for a fight and and that's the problem and it you know Germans in polish guys can drink for several days and maintain their composure\nLegal mentally ill we lose our minds and it's very very important that though but I don't want to spend more time because I Want to get to my buddy Jeff from the banana republic a Jeff good morning Sarah how are you great to hear from you and I I'm I'm not on a cliff today but I was worried about President Trump's statement last night to Mississippi Riley Garcia\nFirst of all I Want to just remind your a university listeners who are going to take advantage of that or a coupon for free beer\nA ever plan on running for public office because well yeah why do the coupon it'll be online it'll be ... will be there forever and held against you\nOld by ...\nAnd you know your your opening comment about the uh Mr Trump or one word for a\nThere we go world\nHe makes Nineteen where I'm being facetious Nineteen true statements\nAnd he makes one relatively untrue statement and what are we focus on\nThe relatively interesting right\nYup in today's New York times or maybe use even yesterday another squirrel Mr Trump's tax returns and as you know I'm a certified financial planner\nAnd I started reading the story\nAnd as I have always reminded of your audience you need to do the math\nAnd this hit job on his tax returns it you know at best is nebulous at worst is Katie ...\nA a um [noise] I got I got a three or four techs yesterday saying oh when that story broke I said give it twelve hours or give it twenty four hours this will be very very different\nAnd I can tell you a Jeff the people in the middle I spoke to one prior to you from just now and he was like it's an odd story don't worry about it it's nothing and it's uh\nUh what what's your take on a ... why is it nebulous\nWell it's not because here's one example for example you and I go into a partnership okay we buy an office building\nIt's a session at a hundred million dollars okay we make an agreement and our partnership that you cannot sell your shared any [noise]\nOh my God his cell phone just absolutely all we got a haze right now we've got to take a break Jeff

[laughter] well you know around ... ... I Know a very noisy these Google and he's a brilliant man\nA gym for the banana republic I'm so sorry about your phone you sound great right now sorry apologize\nFor that the the string to my ten can breaks and the win so you'll have to forgive\nHim it happened it was it happens I Want a money on the wires got\nWell I even heard it on the news you know they're talking about this return about questionable attached\nTactics and and I just again let's do the math you and I have this agreement we are going to buy this office building for a hundred million bucks but the deal is you can only sell it to me you can't sell your shared anybody else okay and vice versa number two\nWe're going to have a buy and sell agreement that says that here's the agree something happens to me here's the agreed price so let's say\nWe value added a because nobody else can bite it's no value to a million dollars okay I drop dead when you get to exercise your option you buy this bill my share out and you funded with some life insurance\nSo therefore you in effect yet my share free\nThe building out a hundred\nMillion dollars and if you're a member of Mr ... uh Trump's father died in Nineteen Ninety nine almost Twenty years ago okay at three and a half percent inflation that quote hundred million dollar building is now worth a hundred and fifty million because you you had\nLife insurance you now gained a hundred and fifty million dollar property\nFor nothing I got there and you\nHad hundred and fifty million dollars tax free or\n... it it cannot be questioned by and IRS forensic accounting ... account or who who comes in and says a ... that's questionable that or do you see any illegality do you see any uh uh uh okay\nNumber one I can guarantee you with the kind of dollars that they were talking about way back then I can guarantee you that thing was audited\nThe questionable part comes in okay well it since you can only sell this building to me or I can ... you can only uh I can only buy it from you\nWhat is that building actually work is it worth fifty million is it worth a hundred well can't be worth a hundred because nobody else can buy it for me right so that's kind of ... it becomes a little bit questionable in fact there were some rulings just recently that they were going to tighten up on that because it is such and I use\nThe word loophole look it is such a loophole and loopholes are not illegal they are taking advantage of the existing tax law in avoiding nodding baiting a void in taxes so again right in this case ah I think your friend was right this is a big nothing burger\nUm eat when you have the amount of assets when you have the amount of property and I'm a let's say a ... even on his ah disposable cash\nOr didn't President Trump while he when he was a a ... a candidate Trump and campaigning didn't he say that I listen to our loopholes and I utilize them all the time and I shouldn't take them away from me but yeah he did mention that Disney\nAgain I give you another example in the New York times story they talk about in ten thousand dollar gift that threads that Fred Trump gave to his son and I assume all would I get\nThat is called the annual gift tax exclusion when you give stuff from way you may be subject to a gift tax if it's during your life it's called a gift tax if it's at death it's called an estate tax\nIt is exactly the same it's a transfer tax in one or the exclusion\nVan was ten thousand dollars per person per year miniatures Trump died a President Trump's mother in two thousand ... died in Nineteen Ninety nine Ninety nine so assuming Mr Trump President Trump was married at the time\nThat could come to forty thousand dollars a year to about ten thousand from each of the parents to both Mr Trump and his at that time wife that's forty thousand dollars a year\nAbsolutely legal ... thirdly\nThey talked about him paying his salary while I defy any farmer here in Wisconsin who hasn't been paying their kids for quote doing chores right\nAre you a a child at that time it could take the standard ... there were just last year the standard deduction was roughly forty four or four thousand dollars I could pay my son four thousand dollars a year tax free\nOkay that's a little\nYeah and I and I and again I heard the news or like when I was waiting on hold again has a oh my gosh this is terrible and it is questionable well yeah\nThe question now now assets that size ... let's say a the portfolio let's say you're a you know you're you're somebody with a couple of hundred grand and you have the mandatory distribution is that the um require mandatory distribution that I think that's what it's called right well if it's a\nPension plan yeah there is required there's mandatory distribution of ... a\nResult of Trump's not retired so that that doesn't\nThat yeah Well Fred was he was Nineteen years old named tree I think when he died so he\nOf this could have been his ... but it ... is taxable income there's\nThere's ways to reduce the amount of tax you could spread it out or a few years but ... when President Trump's income at that time I assume it was packed that match them up and so\nThis gets very complicated I trust Mr Trump President Trump had hired the bashed I'm hires a hike and probably bet that the IRS have looked at that many many times and I remember this is the New York department of revenue that's looking at the token\nWho controls the New York department of revenue\nDemocrats Democrats presently Governor Cuomo ...\nYeah there's this sound like a set up is is found like another squirrel the the cabinet\nAlone is falling Larry yeah let me buttress your uh your uh your hunch here are the New York attorney general who was offered several complaints formal complaints against Hillary Clinton who I you know they are a New York residents\nOf for the Clinton Foundation they will formal complaints filed not one investigation was launched by the New York attorney general and this is going back two or three years now and and and just ... I'm Sorry five years because we get to come in time flies\nUm and again and it winds up in the circular file time and time again but all of a sudden we now have an aggressive attorney general because the previous guy lost his job for being a degenerate\nI'm I I can tell you that uh this is politics has hit a level of of evil I think that's the word I can I look at today evil when you have a ... Democrats out there in mailing rice and potentially to the White House today as well besides the Pentagon and as a Secretary Mattis\nUm you have Whoopi Goldberg talking about Donald Trump's juniors or children\nUm if there's a way they're going to press the button to press the button and when you have a a a a corporation the size of from they can find something eventually and that's their attitude but by God there was a lot of investigations they needed to conduct them there was actually one conviction a couple of weeks ago of Andrew Cuomo's right hand man\nAnd uh he uh he violated that trust is terrible and ah but that's it you're saying that doesn't married to a Andrew Cuomo yes it does I could connect that no time but that investigation will never be done\nAnd a jet really appreciate your uh and you know your advice and you write your knowledge today or do you think they can get them I mean I I guess instinctively I Know you don't have all the files in front of you\nThey don't know the entire world of his assets but uh it ... you know that size I said to her friend yesterday if they want to find something they'll find something I mean it's just you know I don't\nI don't think they're going to get 'em again I think this was going to drift 'cause remember a couple of years or ... yeah it was a couple of years ago where they found a copy of the state tax return that just showed that lost because of the shell of this Trump\nOr yeah airlines yep\nNo I don't think that if I had it but one quick comment eight hundred and fifty thousand\nAnd ms forge a go find me page right yep how much is how is that\nI don't know I've never uh yeah it's\nNot it's considered gifts oh gee what what I see her eight hundred and fifty\nThousand dollars that I met reward are strict cuter tore up\nI think to or anything I think the word anything comes to mind when you asked that question you're willing to say anything for that the fact that amount of money\nYes Adam how many uh three hundred million people you think there might be one or two or three\nWho might say things like this\nJeez I'm shocked and taken aback Jeff I I I didn't think something like this could happen in America today and the map [laughter] jama great\nA great advice and raped or knowledge thank you sir appreciate that it is a twenty past the hour if you'd like to give us a call it's three to one Thirteen ten toll free age seven seven to three five thirty ten that Sean ... this is the dad kind of ratio new song Thirteen ten WNBA\nGo on to me that I'm Sorry I mean there are but but like do people like this idea that somehow I'm going to send an envelope from some random who knows what that somehow that the president of the United states\nAnd they do or email obviously and we've heard stories of the letters but it's not like they literally just like the guy doesn't knock on the oval office door and say male sir and hand them a stack of envelopes they're not open to find the interview\nWait a minute you're telling me somebody speeding rates\nAll these black beauty so I keep going All right well my feeling sorry ... coming up with my ... I'm Sorry I I I Would throw that comment\nI've got a president worn out to the male role reached more than ...\nGot her coffee going yet and it's over it's helping you got you know and he's he's got a cigarette hanging out you know I have a drink a beer but I think I can I just I don't do individual hard and down because uh he's a very different looking guy and he he's gotta\nWhereas from one guy with the weird build the I can relate but yeah he does seven different different proportion and and it ... you know different depending on the angle and look he looks drastically either looks to be a relatively healthy build and then other angle just him or going ooh that do it's got some man or something\nI write go yeah so but I don't know why we're way way way way can build doesn't make him insane [laughter] I'm Sorry I have like\nLike the weird placement of of of kind of where you know how it got is it's it's an obviously is not a drinker so maybe I'm just so used to seeing the beer belly because it's not really a beer belly but it is he does have\nThese ... you know he's pear shaped do that I guess that's the idea\nAnd it's like when you see a dude with a huge but at a big family do you ever do what's going on how you ain't got no don't do something about that yeah yeah I'm sitting here you're it's in my face\nAnd I always felt bad for my friends are just had big legs in a ... is is like that because it was just weird guy should not have big butts just [laughter] what am I what am I making these observations they have no idea uh what I'm what I'm getting through the atmosphere politics\nA show on on I'm going to put you in a tough spot here\nWhen you say that the Democrat approached and you know we listen to the hearings\nWere you listen to comments for many Democrats across the country we listen to the media elites celebrities musicians and and other people who have a bully pulpit\nUm I've never seen anything like this I mean I get a ... you look at what happened to George W. Bush and I said to myself that wow these people are angry this was just the same group of ...\nThis is something I never thought possible this is the day after an inauguration All right well you may reach their opinion of the hands of the administration for them and I just um\nIs it um you know what I'll let you ... oh well\nWould just I feel that said\nThough that there is always buying you mentioned the George W.

Bush taking it on the chin allowing the press that go wild and doing nothing\nDoes nothing except to embolden the leftist Americans also very keen sense of justice and what they saw on the way that Donald Trump is being treated now and how brick ... a judge Kavanaugh was treated or that it wasn't just\nThat wasn't fair and when you are outrageous is your side when you\nActually are trying to redefine justice in to social justice right\nWill said obviously\nYou're redefining not only just this year redefining family you're redefining what the word veteran means yeah I'm not kidding they're trying to redefine that everything\nSexuality man woman\nHow wages are you when you have a nation sitting back watching death\nThis show going on yeah and and ... and our elected officials sit back on their hands and allow this to continue no this is called fighting back and it is ugly and they can get uglier but there is a huge difference between\nTaking one on the chin and inciting violence\nRight and fighting back to defend yourself or beating down a bully because any man does any real man knows that\nWhat is going on now not only goes against human nature\nAnd I don't mean the worst parts of human nature I mean the best parts of human nature of the best parts of America that's what's going on now and that's what this fight is going to look like and the only way you get it to stop is you have to investigate\nOr you can do it at the polls but you ... that people like four she's a liar she's perjure\nEither and by the way we're allowed to say that we don't believe the store and we don't buy the story there there were enough holes in that story and now accusations of more holes in the story um I I'm not going to feel guilty about saying listen I Do believe she's a sympathetic figure but I also believe and by the way I was with my doctor yesterday\nAnd he said almost immediately because he's he's a quiet and secret member of a A R a of our own conservative movement and he just does not talk to any patients are like this and he knows what I Do it and where I work\nUm and he said to me that ah they the left does not understand that the the tyranny that they're encouraging is eventually going to do a one eighty on them when when the uh the ... getting into power who do they go after the intellectuals of the artist ends of the creators the thinkers\nAnd they don't know their own fate and uh it's incredible uh Scott I I I don't know if you agree with that but you only vaguely\nYeah I Do that that's part of history however it will never get that far you know why because it's America because we still have a first and Second Amendment and there are a beach in oh people that think like us\nThere are only a minority of very vocal minority supported by the press that believe what they believe anything that happens we'll be quelled very quickly\nFor the same reasons that we have those God given rights are not not rights given to us by by men can ah um ...\nScott let me ask you this when you have the less the status and and I believe a communist movement\nAnd they're certainly being helped encouraged and supported do with the co conspirator known as the fourth estate um people would say that this is extremely extremely a reckless language that amusing because it it it it gives them cover if they call me a cycle of Colombia right wing psychopath\nThe fact is they're running cover for a very very radical message um I Do you and and the silent majority who work who go to school who pay the mortgage to pay the er the car note and are sending their kids to college or that silent majority do you think they might be looking at take a day off next November\nNot a chance ... you know one cent chance um nobody\nIn my circle and I don't have any friends that have bags of cats in their head\nUh but I Do have people that sit on the fence I have people that are not about politics yeah I don't know anyone that's that's not looking at what is going on objectively and is that shaking their heads and this this ... this this time to get involved\nWere already at all and and if you have to buy your back in time if you take a day off take off\nElection day and go vote if you take a day off and uh and that's a what we need to encourage the end of the message that President Trump sent out last night I absolutely agree with\nUh we don't have enough of majority to uh to quell to ah to tamp down what has become a very very radical left wing a message coming from the Democrat side of the aisle we need more Republicans and then that's the only way we stop this\nAnd to the non violent way is at the ballot box and using that bully pulpit and I don't want to you when you started the show and you you slapped her forehead when Trump was making his statements\nI'd say two things number one what would what he was stating with factual it might it is in\nA a a bit a of red meat no doubt but second of all I I trust that he probably already got the not from the FBI that they've concluded that their investigation so he felt safe to end quote unquote attacking the it wasn't attacking the victim there is no you said there that was not factual and and\n... yeah I I think uh I think you picked up on the fact that I'm going to my old detective days and there are certain things you say and not say at a certain time during an investigation and that was the instinct that popped up with me and Oh absolutely\nAbsolutely but this man is a lot more measured than anyone give them credit for\nA year he does speak from the heart and you don't speak off the cuff quite a bit on like a rock Obama who would or would it would start or an trip on every single word if it wasn't out of a teleprompter this man's coming from the heart\nAnd we all know is American when you sit next to someone whether you're they're taking your BS meter like Rocco rama or whether they're not they're they're being fear even when they tripped up and that's that's President Trump\nOr if he thinks it he says it and maybe that's not so bad uh Scott I appreciate your call today my friend well done uh it's Eighteen past the hour I I I wanted to give Scott he held them\nThe break in and uh we have Dave holding on for the much maligned gurney Illinois and um people listening all over the country and I heart radio for evil you know you got to

the fact is they died shortly afterwards so I Do in that\nAnd it's a this is America man just the the they became the ugly Americans and it sounded the pursuit of happiness is just not a super suit you may not win and you may go broke\nAnd ... look at you and I how wildly successful\n[laughter] we all can get it when you when you were telling us aid it\nBrings up till kind of the questions about

I'll be a reasonable I look at it and I'll I'll examine it and said to myself well I was a little cheesy\nBut if it's a loophole grapes let's be honest here view and I owned a business and there was a little and we're looking at a a economic reality that we need to jump through that loophole would you do it\nIf it's legal yes yeah absolutely and in in in the past the statute of limitations so we'll never know exactly if you know\nIf if it's not illegal there's no statute of limitations now is that\nYou're right you know you're but if the if the conclusion or if the argument is well is can he be charged with anything well even if they find that there's there's not I ... my my thing was less about the legality of it and more about kind of this this self made man kind of image that the that the president often projects is like\nYou know he was he was saying well to do kid from queens and the neighborhood he came from in Queens I'm you know my buddy bill Williams was a native of\nOf that uh well outside of that area he certainly was not a in that neighborhood\nBut when you point out my dad's a wife God rest his soul passed away when I was in the hospital\nUm that was one of the richest neighborhoods are on the east coast and a\nA no doubt about it this you know and he went to the best schools in a certainly um was not suffering as you grow up a kid but if you take a meal with an interest uh and and you turn it into what Donald Trump turned it into [noise] um yeah they got their ... if you appreciate the uh uh\nCapitalism and success you got to say yeah not a bad job they're brother and I bet you out\nOf the question is is that was I mean was that is that true and that's that's to me it's kind of the the the hang up there as did it was it really that he\nWill do the million alone or ... something more nefarious in something more serious\nBut I I think I think it does this tale that he tells of I got this loan from you know ... all the stuff he yeah he nobody denies the was raised wealthy but he has this this this presentation than\nI was given a million dollar loan and I built this empire I wasn't ... anything this New York times story whether it's whether it's tax issues or otherwise it does show however legal or illegal that that to me I don't know that there's to me personally it ... the relevance is more of\nIt basically paints a picture of a guy who was given far more than a million dollars uh in in in it's not so much to me it a point punches some holes in this in the sorry man kind of story\nOkay and uh I at ... ... is it a reasonable assessment on your part\nUm I'll say yeah you know if that's a it is what it is but the\nUh there was a certain level of work investment knowledge and application\nThat I Do believe Donald Trump applied and uh his success in his wealth and and the growth of that a corporation\nOr certainly he has something to do with that and again if we look at the origins of the uh the financing at the beginning um you know somebody had to build it and I I disagree with the rock Obama every day President Obama said that you you you you you didn't build that well I guess I guess what what what I did\nA but this is a guy who is the status to as a ... a marshal\nOr by a communist uh Frank Marshall Davis and uh again his his political and intellectual mental was Frank Marshall Davis a registered communist a new President Obama believes in that ... of of philosophy you know I'm Glad we\nYeah somebody else in office I don't think he was a very good president I didn't like his philosophy I don't I didn't like is the application of rules regulations and when he said that he's going to put his foot on the neck\nOf industries in corporations or that's what I knew that this man had a gold and America I see a dark time coming as a result of the lack of education and we've been receiving since the Nineteen sixties and I'm right on time and I miss Cortez of New York\nI'm clearly a a communist besides sanctions used misused socialist but she was a communist\nI'm at and they believe in a charity and they believe in controlling your life reaching into your pocket stealing your of forming a efforts and taking half or at least three quarters to give to the to the ...
