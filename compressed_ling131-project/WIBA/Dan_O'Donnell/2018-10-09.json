I understand that I have friends who are are different thinking on this but anybody who is a critical thinker any mom out there the moms at best the best lie detectors in the world\nAnd if you're a member of the bar if you're an officer or the court if you're if you're a journalist\nHow do you sit down and say this story was plausible let's just to quote bless you for the other two are in saying that mean that they just turned out to be piles of garbage and they they they are going to disappear never heard from a get\nOut of an army is going to what you know I I Hope he runs I Do hope he he he runs a as a Democrat I'll live but I I if you were critical thinker a buddy of mine from the great Marlene family down in Janesville you had the great modeling family up here in in Madison as well\nAs you get a great them or you get the great modeling apartments to on the east watch that new facility and uh I uh my buddy Kurt Marlene was telling me one day he was cooking for the guys\nI'm it morally lumber and he was just you know the little cookout a couple of years ago with and he ... he says you know I I Know the economy he's actually ... you know hanging out and live with my dad\nAnd ah you know maybe ... pointing out everybody's entertaining is this that and I'm In one guy said don't know I just can't listen I ... have you listen to the show no I Can't say you know he's a right wing Republican\nWell have you ever listen to the show not no no no I Can't do that can support that can support it's like what are you talking to members of certain unions across the country without Robert Robert Robert Republicans running across the light women\nAnd I'm like you know when do you walk away and there was a guy is a former liberally started the has to walk away moving I'm I'm Glad he's doing that\nUm because I I think a lot of Democrats and independents and and uh uh an independent thinkers are just saying well you know I I Can't leave it's like part of the rules preach craves you know you know you're not allowed to leave you remember the Democrat Party\nYou know it's it's it's a little cousin us close enough [laughter]\nI Know plenty left to jump ship of both parties over the years\nI I'm a guys do I I I can tell you right now there's a lot of Republicans who have a very very libertarian approach to was social issues and you know after the last couple of years like these guys really have no ... [laughter] very I'm jumping out of it I'm sick of what my Republican brothers and sisters I'm stick but\nUh I Know people have left and now their independence and I know more right leaning left but they have very very libertarian points of view on certain things um that certainly they can caucus with a Democrat if they have to and that that's what scares me I'm ... but ... you know how you say no to listen to Dan comedy show\nAnd you know not possible it is ... I was actually stopped on my way walking to pick match up from school by somebody yesterday came up to me and she said hey you're showing Madsen is dead I listen to you when Dan every single day\nAnd

patient when people which is something I can I yeah I never ever ever do never\nIt's like you just ... them against my dad who would walk of their own any could I mean it was really a flaw in his part he could not sell for a ignorance just couldn't do it he with his face would go through a metamorphosis\nWhen he would realize that he's dealing with somebody who is very very ignorant and he couldn't understand why other people didn't have the command of the issues like he did\nUm my dad could do the New York times crossword puzzle and pen on yeah on Sunday which is when you've got the crossword puzzle and just knock it out and he's like and we just be annoyed\nLike last night I and I have shades of this I'm nowhere near his status um I in fact that I figured out short preview gonna love this because you and I both listen to other show and we both love it\nMy dad is ... smart that's that's the level he's out there it's just like ... than you know he just yet why is that not in your head why does that not available to you um and I put I put Vicki McKenna right there as well if I had I intentionally have chats with her sometimes and I and I'll\nI'll be stupid [laughter] just to get a reaction\nAnd ah but she you know she diagnosed by problem by the way I don't know if I tell you that shoppers she diagnosed by Maliki's that when they built me they put the uh they created the instructions in the wrong line which I we don't know what language is and this is why I fall on them and I\nHad a stroke he'll be back now isn't the only like they have yeah yeah but he yeah yes brain surgery strokes radiation and a lot of fun he's a fun guy and uh oh look at the giant hole is like what does that come I think despite\nThat was like man I got to go into hiding place I I Need I Need hiding a ... the fed to create a hiding slapped me completely and totally a an absence of the insects and and hit a mob hit men so\nThat was built you imperial using metric standards is that\nKind of so many kids in the wrong ranked device scholars striking I alright you'll be\nFine and um but I and my dad would just absolutely flip out it'd be it and it was a ... and and I just loved it because I was oh sharp enough to get where he was coming from and yet we have ... family members who are just so good is it going\nYeah I can stay in this room I got to go have a good day it's ... it's like when he's in the marine corps he would they would talk to a and CEOs in certain offices like yeah he's guys around and you know and she hasn't offices I don't get it\nAnd I'm like well dad you don't get it because you get into fights all the time in your you know you'll lightweight champion wrinkle in Nineteen fifty three and the only guy who beat him and they enter a service or a fight was Puerto Rican kid and a whipped Israel and my data celebrates that that that are beating you took\n'cause he was one of the best twice a year he thought he had he never got knocked out my dad\nAnd a supporter and Kennedy always forget his name but he went on speaker come away champion the world so that's who beat my dad who had to be my debt and that but yet the intellect was uh he ... he wanted to go into the box when he got the marine corps\nAnd ... you know what this nauseous is dead jumper what's that he looked at Americans you know what I Can't mess that face up I got to go on a different direction [laughter] he's a good look at me and my dad was a movie star handsome and uh but just a I think that's a flaw that's ... that's it to not be able to deal with people\nWho may not be sharp showing I see you're talking about issues when I'm when I'm In the studio and it's like a you don't get frustrated you have patients but it's probably not as good as your dad right\nNot even yeah it's I I I Am a very patient guy but not it was I I in my entire life my dad yelled once I saw him Gail one time in my entire life and it was because his sister my aunt darn near burn the cabin down and that\nAngered him other than that I have never seen the guy get mad for I couldn't do that\nYeah that's you know I ... I Would get the uh the D I dressed out you know by you so stupid I don't think\nWhy you standing here tell me a lot of stupid [laughter] you just always it was like a you and says your own question the way I see it done these factories across the head and I would just throwing myself to the ground\nAnd he's like get up it was like that I'm pretty sure this way you want to do [laughter] he thought the level and my brother would get a couple even gets away with this\n[laughter] your dad's perspective on boxing and getting into it reminds me of there's a great a Simpsons episode where it's discovered that\nThat Homer cannot be knocked out like his brain is so small that it's well pad\nAnd and ... was that way [laughter] mostly black the bartender was like a he was when he was a kid he was a boxer and he said uh they used to call me kid gorgeous but later on it with kid presentable and then keep gruesome and finally my\nMind [laughter] kitchen alone and let me tell you how much how I was I was present them all at one time and I was going to get prism [laughter]\nYou know and you just reminded me who macgregor who wants to fight the other day the guy is bad for the game he's bad for the sport I I Hope he never goes into straight boxing because he just bad for the game but uh he paid a who was that was a big fight we're all waiting for 'em that uh uh\nWith the shape boxing match\nYeah yeah the boxing match I got ... he's one of the greatest hoaxes of all kinds of ...\nAh well anyway after that fight or a McGregor actually played him a paid him a compliment\nAnd nobody flipped out because there was a racial um introduction and um my dad growing up 'cause I hated fighting Mexican guys as well why is that that you could knock those brothers out man they were the best they just uh you can beat them for a week they'll never go down to my dad was similar to that but the\nIrish guys tend to believe the they do you know the short features tend to bleed uh but the Mexican guys man they could fly for a week and just not go down and that they're\nThey're a tenacity and they're trying to you know the training they put into it just the whole point may weather thank you it was a Floyd Mayweather thank you Sean\nAnd oh by the way it was a Glenn fry that we were talking about Glenn fry and thank you Brandon who was a it was up on that um but I I that was a compliment he paid to may weather and it was oh no no no no I made you Mexican is one of the highest complement you can get\nAnd you know whether it's PAL when I was a kid\nAnd the or the police academy I was one of the last classes that would actually you know you boxed got punched in the face and they wanted you to learn how to do that\nUm and again\nWe're so politically correct today so I Want to teases issue as we go into this break\nJohn ... video yesterday on Facebook this goes to the entire conversation the entire ethos of the country a PC or harassment\nHow you deal with a lady in public today and this woman was from Scotland I think the entire video and the answer there was a recording in Scotland does a guy sitting on a train she's a very beautiful girl she's clearly having a bad day\nOr so he writes something down and he was looking at her on and off and he writes something down a is getting off the train and he gets off about three or four stops the before her he hands or the piece of paper and says don't read for a one minute he gets off the train she opens up the um the the piece of paper\nAnd it says I you're having a bad day but you're much too beautiful than I have a smile on have it right down the roads view of things that nothing uh uh on toward nothing a filthy and nothing out of control and she ... she posted video on Facebook that pretty much says\nI was on a train this happened to me and I have to tell you I feel like I've been assaulted\nI feel like I've been molested in a way I feel like oh this is a very very bad terrible situation and I just I I'm saying to myself the entire globe was going in a direction now again if you approach a woman today if you want to speak to a woman that the the natural back and forth or how you doing and the social setting I'm Talking in a bar\nA Braves if you were still in the game today and I'll ask you before as we go into the spring\nIf you're still isn't game today and if you're still I'm interested in talking to a nice young lady or at a bar or something like that you know you got to approach that women don't like approaching guys\nPaul is going on is is not acceptable [laughter] and I yeah\nWell you know I I I think I'm a General Kelly is made it clear are you are probably going to make it to the end of the uh the term\nAnd even end of the first administration um but for them in a dude I'm with you when when the president says I got a big announcement or that's going to take place in and we can probably covered this any minute now um I Hope it's not a case of ah she was celebrated too much because I thought she was very effective is UN ambassador\nA very effective as in ... President Trump's agenda uh my palm pale who as we got good news um and again a good does does not mean accomplishments good news does not mean an\nAgreement um but Kim Jong un has invited the pope to come to a North Korea or again take this step with a grain of salt and this is not does not mean accomplishment victory or or an agreement and signing of a of a a\nA a peace accord of some sort and the reduction of nuclear devices are on the peninsula has to be in agreement here and that's that's the best time to go shovel a I don't think Kim Jong un is going to back off of that um again you have a I I don't want to see any uncertainty and any a\nA movement in the administration and with them with the members of that have been strange I I Would be nervous about a move like this and so this could be a positive who knows and when you have President Trump come out and said this could be a positive\nI'm here's what we're hearing according to the AP Haley discuss her resignation with Trump last week is showing people do people or people just pointed out and nothing like that was amazing ah last week when she visited the White House a new sources said her a news\nI'm shocked a number of senior foreign policy officials in the Trump Administration\nUm he'll use the former governor of South Carolina was easily confirmed four days after President Trump's inauguration twenty Seventeen\nUm again we're going to take a break down at the bottom of the hour news and once the president and ambassador Haley uh get up and running we'll get to that press conference a immediately we will carry that it is thirty to pass the hours that is the one and only Sean people\nThis is the damn con ratio news talk Thirteen ten WNBA we shall return [noise]\n\nLive from the group health cooperative he's continuing\nW.

they had a really good relationship with the press mean think about it as opposed to\nWhat we're watching today in a you know if if this has been destruction breeds in the wrong way and maybe I'm I'm a little bit sensitive to this praised but man they have been just you know uh she said there were very as opposed to what is wrong with them and uh\nThey uh effect or Avon kept Trump they were a ... they were just a fact checking every word and and and she used the word wrong in a sentence they challenged I've just insane what's going on it's just absolutely insane\nBut this administration is going through 'em and they you know they've they've kind of slowed down their uh their conferences and their their oppressors what that\nAnd the last ... did you catch some of the last rally preach ...\nIs ... and the president was ... was with a law enforcement yesterday\nAnd he's pointing at the in the back you know to them the journalist and again I I I Believe the president of the stadium

on Facebook and Twitter\nWhen you talk about the beginning of the Trump Administration\nAnd you think about the people that a President Trump hired and appointed [noise]\nThere is there's ego involved in Tracey a sense or another message here ah but doesn't Nikki uh getting good press at the UN doesn't that the that poses a a positive\nUm for the president and ah reflect his the steam\nI'm a I'm hoping for a very positive message coming out of this resignation uh I think ... might be onto something except uh uh I think this conversation will certainly be divided I really believe that the American people are willing to accept something here showing people\nWill say listen I got into office I've never been a politician there were certain people I was told the higher there were certain people listen this guy Paul Manafort he's awesome lasted a certain amount of days he got whacked say I'd rather you got to go\nUm there were people connected to the campaign that like you know one of these people yeah you got you know please go away and yet and you make appointments or like Rex Tillerson\nWhen you when you find out when you first start in administration I said at the very beginning of the term this man is going to fire a few people you need to get ready for that I made it very clear at a couple of days after he was elected\nUm do you think Sean people if Donald Trump came out just regarding the or the movement of the personnel within his administration\nListen I was never part of this ah this machine that was never part of the swamp and I was never part of a uh the ... politic about Washington DC it's a hell of a learning curve and I've learned my lesson\nI hire some of the wrong people I I I made some poor decisions and and I think right now we corrected most of those decisions were in a great direction\nUm and he's going to throw him that Jeff Sessions yeah you need to go and I'm pointing out what you're what you're mentioning and I I Do believe just needs to resign I don't know why sticking it out I ... and again\nI'm you look at the meeting or that the president they flew an air force one to go to Rod Rosenstein there's going to be some breaking news today about the\nUh the attorney a Baker who was the general counsel for the FBI or he actually he testified there like less than some of these people give me bad information and he reported it immediately I'm In other words the one eighty it's going to be done on the Democrats here I think it's going to be significant one I could be wrong so I'm not saying it's a done deal\nUm but what would you accept that listen I made mistakes Sean I fired the people you know certainly the first year was a little tumultuous uh but I think I have some of the best people that I can have around me and we've calm things down look at our successors so would you accept that um that explanation of the volatility within the\nThe I I Do and I think also the thing we forget is kind of how President Trump became president and the battle buddy bought not only with Hillary Clinton but with the Republicans he was real given 'em when it came to kind of carving out who is\nWho is supporters were going to be who is backers were going to be the people in his district and the Republican institution they didn't want anything to do with them and and you mentioned the Manafort thing I think a lot to say well why do you choose Manafort he chose Manafort because the reality is all the other all the other kind of traditional guys the mainstream guys\nThey were already on other campaign so he was kind of dealing with a little bit of labor outline\nWhat sound like somebody a mainstream traditional ah establishments Republicans they wouldn't have taken a job for all the money in the world you know this guy's repulsive fees disgusting and you'll get that Showtime show the circus water really and it was one of the Bush administration there's a lot of uh elite Republicans who are\nI Believe there are there left of center on some issues I ate and you look at a a crystal and\nUh some of the ... again I notice a lot of people repulsed by the thought of Donald Trump I get that\nUh but the fact is I think the guys working with us I think a he's a committed to making some conservative choices I don't think Brett Kavanaugh is committed conservative I think he's an establishment Republican I'm a progressive and I think he's going to uphold roe v Wade if it's a challenge I don't think it will be by the way\nUm and he when he said he believes the president or what we call balls and strikes in the uh yeah ... on the Supreme Court I think he uh I think he might be a little bit more John Roberts then he then he has Kennedy which will be a better thing overall Kennedy was the swing vote no doubt and that's what he replaced\nA but the woman who is supposed to be up next a Coney I take her name because she spelled it wrong or trying to sell the rights would sound like Connery and so she could have one but\nThis woman is a true true conservative and I think what does she have seven eight kids um it's a very active and and very active in our community very giving and very
