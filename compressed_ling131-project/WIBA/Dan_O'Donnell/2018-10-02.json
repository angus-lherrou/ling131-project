Cavanaugh today I I I think I should be able to laugh about certain things\nBecause I'm going to be consistent here I'm going to give you an example of a of investigative honesty showing people was I not demanding the head of Keith Ellison last week was I not demanding that you if you served me keep thousands head on a platter I'll give you capital did not say those words\nYou did and there's a there's pod cast out there to prove it we got liberal ...\nAnd you got the you've got the ... report\nUntil ...\nHey we have to show like they feel they have a nice she got the water with the husks you got the husk right that's what the ... lights up yet actually I ...\nBridge and um I I said give me a Ellison or give me death and I uh\nUh well the point that we've tried to make is I Would be honest\nNow information has come out the last evening or the DNC is conducted their investigation on a Mr Allison who was the number two guy for the Democratic party\nFor the DNC and his girlfriend alleged that she had a video at one point and she's been requested three times to turn it over that video she has not done that and she said three different excuses as to why she hasn't done that\nGuess what people will say I now I now give less white to her story I have ... if you're being honest in it and if you're investigating honestly you must give less weight to her story why did she say something like that you said he had to ... you know there was a video of the assault\nOn you I'm\nA report that came up from the DNC yesterday of course they're not they're going to be satisfied with a report I noticed the heritage don't cooperate you are All right let's get let's go get Kavanaugh was asked now yeah and ah and I'm like whoa whoa hold up you know all the ah hold your horses and what's the offer me the information that you have\nAnd the information that was all for it last night uh when you tell me three times that you had a video and the last excuses well it's so embarrassing I just don't want to show and\nI Am now suspect the first story is that a ... legitimate I'm a points to a restaurant when when I'm uh discussing the uh complain that against ah the the ex girlfriends keep Allison's ex girlfriend is that a legitimate does fast but I\nI think so but yeah investigative Lincoln are what are we going to wait for you but I Would say I would say but I don't know that I carry a lot of credibility with with a lot of folks when it comes to this this particular incident but I think\nWell I uh I mean if you if you offer me what you believed to be evidence and you're and you're talking about a you brag about it a ... it's a it's like hiring of an audio is your attorney you know if you want to lose credibility high end that cat\nUm and again it all the a lot of the complaints that are coming out about that Mr Kavanaugh all the complaints you know it's what's the what's the main theme what's the thing coming out right now no cooperation\nI I don't know it was the uh yeah ... ... you know the the sweat hog and that's what I'll call her sweat hog\nGet the husks ... nice you know they they people want the report still ... a ... yeah and the ... should not do that in the ... the peach\nAnd uh I I think about uh all the other plane is now the sweat hog lady uh who allege that a judge Kavanaugh him and his buddy my judge were a spiking the punch but last night she's on an interview with NBC and join the interview she says list that\nI didn't see him put this stuff in the punch containers and uh but I saw him given out a lot of red sellout cuts to the late eighties\nOkay did uh did Kavanaugh rape you ... I don't think it was Cavanaugh I didn't see him write me or anything like that but that he was giving out a lot of red sellout cops like I'm sitting I'm like why in the hell with NBC put this on the air\nWhy the hell with the New York times print the story about a bar fight Nineteen eighty five were uh the professional basketball player Dudley who was very good friends with the judge ... now judge Kavanaugh and he wrote a letter but nobody's talking about the letter thing listed I I was with the guy\nAnd find a way that you know about the dude came out and said well I was at Yale and I saw him drink at a big ... big drinking problem there's video that guy\nIn one fell swoop I beg to ... he's guilty as charged she's lined his rear end or why he closed his eyes for the entire time that he said that uh you know he could have been passed out drunk while I never saw and pass out its baby Cornish could've should've won a date now I'm not sure yet but that bill this is getting insane\nAnd um I I think I'm going to start demanding of both this Friday this is how out of control I'm going to be a lot to talk about that I Will try to a couple of some other issues as well as it is fifty eight past the hour that's the one and only showing people on those terrible Tuesday but it's a great Tuesday\nBecause you have the division champs right here in the great state of Wisconsin

I\nHad it for more\nCommon sense advice on life and money go to Dave Ramsey dot com\n\nGrowing up to read today\nRewind Ninety One not as\nThe FBI keeps probing Brett Kavanaugh's past I'm Dave Anthony Fox News and Republican Senator Jeff flake who led the charge says he wants to be sure\nAnd you want to get a house back in the Senate back based upon this\nGot to play this delay game yeah now I'm at a point where you know keep doing it right up until election day see how that works out for you because whether you like it or not\nI really believe that these are these rallies with President Trump at West Virginia or Tennessee and he is making the rounds he's not going to let up he's not taking his foot off the gas I really believe a lot of Democrats are calling quietly saying themself I think we're in trouble\nThey're supposed to be a blue wave and I'm not seeing it a lot of the internal numbers after the Kavanaugh hearings across the country guess what Republicans made up a lot of ground lot of ground\nAnd I I seem to be asking this question every single day but I'm going to ask you ask it again do I want to hear about somebody's high school\nA behavior at parties if obviously I I'm not talking about a rape allegation I'm going to do I want to hear about some of these high school a beer drinking in their college beer drinking\n\nThe New York times the old grey lady and the old grey lady and my dad started this phrase for anybody else did years ago the old grey lady and\nWhat she used to be men shame what she used to be all the news that's Adam Schiff to print and boy they got they print a lotta shifts lately and\nYes he was in a bar he was questioned and I and I know why they're doing it I I Know why they're furthering us the story\nBecause they want to jump on board with the Democrats let's face it the fourth estate is alive and well and they're very very ... a year we told you at a temper problem is a terrible\nTemper prop not happen and you're not getting that one got to do better than that got to do better than red solo cups\nAnd I'm Glad ah McConnell that showed some counties yesterday and said yeah well what happened to vote this week\nI'm Sorry I Can't help doing that when I'm looking at the Capitol I Love the guy but uh yeah sometimes I hate the guy to\nOh we're going to have this vote who ... who\nDid you see that before though what's that we're going to have a vote on this\nLike a week ago that he did but uh you know that's that's before a Senator Flake stabbed every Republican in the back yeah I'm I'm going to stand with the or the Democrats here now I'll voted out of committee but I I Need a one week investigation now what is that one week investigation started that they're showing people\nIt's turned into more questions and more delaying more ...\nMore pay ball that that does thousands upon thousands of ... we can't set the shot clock on day James called me yesterday New York times editorial\nUh it's kinda stupid ... set a shot clock on this well wait a minute they weren't you the guy in personal came on and said yeah got a few thousand emails on a ... a laptop and uh we need to check them out and the Democrats wanted your high\nBy the way you ... you were still wearing a hero to them yet because once they found out your back there but that's the one the Democrats really like it but the\nFact is he comes out a well we'll get this done in no time at all then three or four days later oh yeah I mean he's cool everything's fine yeah I don't worry about that turns out that according to ... testimony from ... in total FBI agents\nYeah they didn't look at every email on ... on the laptop they sampled the fuel with but the the entire investigation was not done\n'em and he comes out but all you can't set a shot clock let me explain ... assets and resources to\n[noise] [noise] and I will use my a former former agency as an example\nThere was a I think today there's upwards of thirty five thousand New York city cops\nAnd amongst those thirty five thousand about ten thousand or detectors I can I can have somebody doing a face to face interview within Fifteen minutes of any location in New York City the five boroughs in fact a we have assets and resources overseas in Europe and the middle east down in Mexico\nYes not ... not just the FBI the NYPD has assets all over the globe\nOr the FBI I Believe has a put a forty thousand employees I Would say a minimum of them are probably thirty thousand sworn agents I can have an interview done anywhere in the country in any amount of time that you needed to be done but everybody so all the way we catch slam dunk this thing I just got a twenty three people were\nOn my own little uh you know we could get the result at a day at ... ... if I don't make these sounds and noises I'm going to start cursing so this is why I'm doing [laughter] I'm losing it they really are about\nAway three hours sleep last night was my mother was on patrol last night with a butter knife got she broke out the butter knife I said\nMom list this it it's just a butter knife and dishes that black you can't be done and so that's not general way you're not going to make it girl\nSo yeah oh okay I'm going back to about it was just walking around yeah like I I guess it's a really a rule you hit a certain age you got to where I Am I'm told the guys have to walk around you know first they make pickles and they walk around while I Do think it was again then they go back to bed that's what I'm told they have to do it a certain age and you know do it I think I'll go ahead\nOh no I I I ... for the guy when when we're talking about kind of what's playing out with the Kavanaugh saying what I Wonder is I think it's pretty apparent the Democrats' plan is to is to delayed delayed delayed delay\nI I Wonder what the tactic is to fight back and er how ... how does that get prevent it I mean um [noise] I [noise] if they're if\nThey if if if Jeff Flake didn't do what he did we wouldn't have to we wouldn't have had to play ball\nSure but but we do and I think that's kind of a thing is is is we're kind of at that point now we know that the no matter what the FBI is going to bring some things into question it's it's it's it's human nature that they're not going to be perfect\nFlake is already said if something is is brought up that he may have been lying I'm during this testimony it's a no vote I Wonder about Lisa Murkowski I Wonder if I ask you the islands if they're let's go back\nTo the ... let's go back to the FBI from it do you want to be the agent now think about this do you want to be the agent\nOr or the team of agents who go out and they start doing interviews and all of a sudden\nThat you'd ... this'll be the sevens invest background investigation by the way\nIt's not a criminal investigations background or you'll be the agents that that's going to come out and say well\nClearly all the other agents who are doing these background and investigations in interviews and a document gathering criminal law you know it just doing a a a wrap sheet check stuff like that\nAnd go on a former employers and talking to a maybe a spouse or or relatives as well do you want to be the agent that comes out Sean ... says\nYeah all those other guys and gals they sucked I was awesome and look what I found that it's not going to happen\nBut isn't this a new scope I mean ... to ... to do it I've got new information man I mean there's a bit aren't we are we looking at now like a okay these ... it's it's one thing okay so we we've investigated um six times but these allegations have never been brought out Orban invest it would be one thing if the FBI and by any of us you know\nIf you have the serial creepy guy if you have the serial guy where are you ladies you know exactly what I'm Talking about\nOut there the guy in the office you're like yeah that's a crepe please stay the hell away for don't talk to me don't come near me everybody knows the creepy guy in the office everybody knows that the leach and the lead\n[noise] um [noise] to me that ... you don't want to be the age and there's going to come out and challenge the professionalism of the agents who investigated the background of Brett Kavanaugh several times you don't want to be that age\nAnd I'm telling you are right now just because of this nonsense and by the way I I I don't want to be the person who I'm told Dan you have to be more sympathetic to what Dr Ford the more I look at that Dr Ford story the more I see information about Dr Ford are engaged in other activities and again\nUh ... hit the big one the jumps out of me preach for I pick up the next call here\nAre the big one that jumps out at me why has her entire digital footprint been scrubbed somebody explain this to me\nOh why is everything almost impossible to find the photographs of her as some of the demonstrations she has her ... at a notice no big granny glasses there and ah and again Mike king\nFor some audio a ... Dr Ford ... in the classroom lecturing I guarantee you her voice does not sound like that voice she testified with I guarantee it\nMy suspicions are now in full full blown up here's the hackles raised man they they are raised in on at some point I'm going to have to say not only do I not leave the story regarding this I think maybe nothing happened to her\nWhich I Know is the third rail for a while we must believe reminds me money sorry I'm not surrendering the or a guilty before proven yourself and I said I'm not going but that said let's go to what Steve on line one has been very very kind to call in speed walking around the down economy show new stock Thirteen ten WNBA gravity call\nDan I'm Wondering just how incompetent the FBI is that we have to do background checks over and over and over and over and over again I mean don't you think we probably need to do fifty or sixty background checks maybe on Kavanaugh to make sure we we catch everything\nNow in defense of in defense of the process if you were assigned to a federal position\nAnd now a do not forget that uh Brett Kavanaugh worked for a George W. Bush so that that there's different positions where it's mandatory a background check has to be done as well and look look at the trouble that Donald Trump got in with a a many close associates say on in his administration uh there there is no requirement\nTime that they timed it where the sweat Haagen ... and uh I'm a ... came out and drop their little ah bombs yeah but I'm now we've got about ... what do you do you think we're going to get another one but what about the dude who was on TV yesterday who\nWas saying yeah I saw him drink to the point where he was going to pass out and about ... did you ever see a pass out no I never saw a pass out I mean is this a surreal to me\nThe ... allegation though isn't it isn't is it it's not old but it's not new either that that this was known about and and so by the obviously it was the Ford stuff\nAs they're as they're as they are discussing this stuff but but the Republicans chose to ignore it because they thought that they could simply get a vote and move on and get this issue behind them not realizing again it's it's it's it's political uh it's such a serious serious thing though me do thing sexual set off\nI'm going to fight you every step of the way it is because I don't believe the Republicans behavior is analogous what the Democrats the Democrats or the or the or the tyrants here the Democrats\nOr the commerce ours who are marshalling they're useful idiots in a direction that they want and again though they're willing to have their millions go out to an airport goes to go to a restaurant go to people's homes and harassed if you had a woman pressing yourself\nA into I'm into the towards the body about one of the body people for Mitch McConnell at the airport she literally thrust during itself into the guy you know what she says after she got that why why you touching a woman like that why it's like oh you didn't want to touch it you\nKnow again there's a lot of people are we're I guess and I go back to ... there's a reason why he got through so easily and and the ... again I don't think Kavanaugh is is probably the best pick and I think that's starting to become kind of the the most apparent part of this is\nBased upon what do you think you've because now you're allowed to sit there and say well he flipped out last Thursday during the ... you know join his defense of his of his background he got so angry you based out of power what was it I think a legitimate reaction was to do the I be accused of being a serial rapist\nHe's the guy who when it's on the record that even Mitch McConnell said this before the pick was made this is not our ... because of issues like this because of because of his histories that this is not the guy we should go with an that's Mitch McConnell that was saying that stuff is\nIt is they really fought and again in ... it's it's politics is how it works the Republicans really thought because because they control the Senate because the the Judiciary Committee that they can run through with this guy this guy is very good member that first time around he was very good at answering but not answering he\nDid everything right at first and I think Republicans thought they get through those hearings very quickly get to vote taken and beyond and moved on with it but it's been a ...\nBut you say quickly uh that was the standard allotted amount of time for any nominee for the Supreme Court there was there was no a shuffling and no uh\nUh ... through it or not ... but the shell shuffling through very quickly everybody got their time and everybody took the grandstand moment and the Democrats took full advantage of that and you know die and hanging out in the background and look what I again I'm not going to let out yet\nAnd um I don't know why I thought she was funny [laughter]\nAnd uh uh but I I I just will not agree with you ... the I don't think the Republicans are analogous with the behavior of the Democrats I uh if there is there cowardice is their hesitation is there a lack of fortitude sometimes that I'll give you that I'll get\nAnd a voice started to repair I'm Sorry ... I'm a you know what planes I blame you\nWere talking [laughter]\nI keep thinking of lame I should uh alright that's your ... this is the kind of ratio new talk Thirteen ten WNBA we shall return [noise]\nFox News radio I'm Chris posture the FBI has started interviewing a high school friend up Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh mark judge Christine Blasey Ford says he was in the room when Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school\nSo far the FBI is talked to for people in its probe and allegations against judge Kavanaugh for senators inane undecided including Republicans Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski Joe Manchin a democratic up for reelection and red state West Virginia it's also mowing the nomination of our\nTalks is Rachel Sutherland in Washington President Trump pulled the campaign rally for Republicans in Mississippi tonight telling a crowd in Johnson City Tennessee last night\nDemocrats believe that they're entitled to power and they have been aligned and I'm blind rage ever since they lost the twenty sixth day like they have their\nFor congresswoman Marsha Blackburn she's running for Senate Fox News reports [noise]\nLive from the group health cooperative he's continuing\nFor me was talk through to\nThat when you why be a\nGood morning I'm Terry ... county executive Joe ... revealing details about his budget proposal for next year there's money for a major expansion of the airport as well as for risk mitigation and a twenty thousand solar panels field\nFewer than half of Wisconsin students in grades three generator for fishing veteran English and math for the third straight year Madison scores lags behind said numbers more than four hundred and fifty five thousand students to go forward exam last spring\nThey're proposing another high rise apartment building on east Washington avenue in Madison this one would also house with a million dollar you've Arts Center from\nA very athletic weather center twenty seven foreign ... sixty one that was the top of the hour stay connected twenty four seven and I will be ... from the group health cooperative news that Harry\n... president\nByline small business capital comes to business lobby were all about finding solutions I'm here with Brian van wall of animal and associate we have Brian secure long term SBA financing for both real estate and operating capital\nWe uncover economic development opportunities to help rebuild cities in the Midwest small businesses have\nAccess to the right amount of capital to be able to grow to the next stage byline small business capital team was able to provide\nMe the opportunity to be more creative in branch out into more market because I had the proper financing mechanism I think the decision making process was quite amazing how fast it happens\nTo ask for all the right information rather small business analyzing quickly heaven leadership to make quick decisions that's not typical\nMy line bank we make a personal and listen to what matters to you on the Web at ... dot com\nThat's my line bank dot com member FDIC\nBeginning yearly physical to keep yourself healthy\nYou get dental checkups to prevent cavities your previous deserves the same your previous is as unique as you are care for its helping future costs in automotive only at cost and can you get your entire ... system analyzed in refreshed your cars overall performance will improve Trump breaks to gas mileage give your previous the\nFull treatment towards it's held and find out just how unique it is expert Priya service only a clause in automotive stone road Madison ...\nLooking for a ... dental insurance for yourself your family or business visit momentum plans dot com check out momentum insurance plans competitive rate much them all playing in an outstanding networking Denton\nVisit momentum planes dot com for a frequent based in Madison was serving Wisconsin momentum dental plans ensuring healthy smiles\nMomentum plans dot com\nYou want to make improvements to your home you've got plenty of ideas about what you want to turn around your property but you're not quite sure\nWhere to go or their regulations that dictate what you can do what kind of preparations involved and most important who can I trust to do the work to yourself a favor go to call line fence dot com not only can they answer all your questions you learn how craftsmanship means more than just getting the job done and that's\nBased on over sixty years of experience yes I said sixty hey you're home don't trust anyone but call nine Pence\nTune into Thirteen ten WNBA each Tuesday Morning at eight straight talk from the house with certified financial planner ... we'll give you straight talk on money management the markets and some financial planning kid Tuesdays at eight here I'm Thirteen gang WNBA ...
