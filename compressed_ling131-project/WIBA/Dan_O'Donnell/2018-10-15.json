read it because I there's no reason to lie about something like this\nOn friday evening was assaulted in Vinton County I suffered a concussion and the answer is now in the hands of law enforcement uh well I had never met my assailant\nUh the words he yelled at me before he attacked me ... to believe that his actions were are politically motivated when I chose to run for office expected to be politically attack but never physically\nI a wage whether or not the to whether or not to share this today but ultimately I think we all need to well reminded that do we need to be civil to each other regardless of our perspectives and again the Democrats have moved away from that civility\nA Hillary Clinton has decided uh where do we can only get back to civility when you give us the house of representatives back when\nYou get the Democrat Nazi Party or the Senate back that's what they get they believe in killing destruction shooting violence burning down you need to vote Republican and thinking Democrats you need to get up the days of Jack Kennedy the days of a of a ... a you know Harry Truman and even\nTo a degree and then when it's on and say and saying saying this even the days of a guy named Bill Clinton\nWhen he lost the house when the ... the historic return to the Republican Party guest with Bill did he used his political brain and came back to the Senate was like oh okay the\nDay of big government is over the line with the man and he was smart enough to latch onto what was the right message\nPlayed ball with Newt Gingrich play ball with the rest of the gang had
