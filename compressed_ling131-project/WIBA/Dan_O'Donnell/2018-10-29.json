and\nAnd um I think were neck and neck I don't think anybody's going to get a massive or a wave here I don't I don't see a red wave coming but I Do say that the uh\nThe cell phone reality in polling my factor in the anti a press east coast that a lot of uh people now feel in fact I saw an article yesterday saying that Trump is winning the war against\nThe media um I don't know where I saw that preach but uh\nBelieve that's true um [noise] I Know\nIt may be he's got he's got a unique way of of handling information to whether it's through Twitter and kind of getting around and sort of ending the traditional media and those type of things I\nI don't I don't I'm not saying he should wait and the war against good journalists maybe we should wait when the war against medium one of\n... the medium I uh I I say that uh there is a dynamic that just can't\nBe counted anymore with a lot of people might support Trump I think that's what I'm trying to develop I think but I I think\nAny polish shoulder and I know everyone wants to point to twenty or twenty sixteen is like an error in polling\nAnd it really it really wasn't an I mean those people were accounted for and then when it comes to you know picking up and I hate to say it this way but when it comes to just picking up any in answering any calls it's older people that are often answering those calls right the younger than is wise or a bigger voters yes yes and so\nI think polar pollsters good ones are ... you know kind of put that into the mix and and kind of understand that stuff I mean for for President Trump\nBased before the election they said everything had to fall perfectly forum and by golly everything ... felt absolutely perfectly for him and he won exactly the way\nThat I think a lot of people thought it thought those type of things going to be it can happen when earlier caller say about is the media the enemy of the people in and I would say no by the way just to clarify call they called and said Britain was a CNN is not an enemy of the people and I think it's a Indian\nAnd what'd you say to CNN and MSNBC or have an agenda because I Do believe they do\nI I don't think they have as much of an agenda as it's as it's portrayed and and I think I think it's the danger is we've we've and we've been harping on this and we saw last week with the arrest of what happens when we do this we don't\nThey're unstable people out there and to find ways to agree to make organizations legitimate news organizations you may agree or disagree you may even feel that they have a a significant agenda whatever it is\nTo make them an enemy of the people a target\nUm especially if you're the leader of the free world that stuff concerns me that stuff terrifies me but I don't think CNN rises to the level of any type of enemy of the people\nThis guy and if a if there's a conservative who is wrong I just got I don't think you and I'd be afraid to point that out and then people get mad at us for doing that you\nKnow ... said it a long time ago I Know Russia's don't just take my word port royal rice search it yourself if something doesn't ring true do the do the research\nSit there and a and take someone it's it's Ronald Reagan's trust but verify I take that much time\nMaybe I'm being wimpy because I'm In the business but let me let me challenging with this\nI don't believe they're the enemy of the people I Do believe there is a supporter of the secular progressive movement I don't think they realize how less they are I don't think they realize how outside the mainstream and how outside of middle America they become I really believe most ironic sorry it's\nNot an excuse from the standpoint of a of the Arab projecting their broadcast throughout the whole nation throughout the whole world truly alright ... and for them to to not look at the marketing for the ... and watch it\nTo ... the ... come on CNN has Food Network stuffing travel stuff they can't even fill twenty four hours on their station you know why they do that because the ratings are so bad for the new ... ... what\nThey want to end anymore Dane when Anthony Bourdain who is now dead or becomes your ratings gather that's that's not a good\nSign there's no ... and no network\nThat purports to be a news network or a purveyor of twenty four hour news would accept that unless you have an agenda and by the gender if you're not going to be honest with your agenda and the CNN is not the news from X time the ex time and we have a democratic slant\nAnd tell people that well then then I'll consume if I if I Want to see that side but I Want them to you is I'll make the decision\nRight right if you offer me that dry\nI'm clean who what where when why approach or I can I can discern that I can disseminate it I can sympathize it and disseminated throughout my friends in my family in a way I think that uh I if I'm fairly reported from what I got from the news we we can have an honest conversation right all by definition they're changing the\nUh the foundation of the conversation from the get go skewing in their direction again it is the\nFerries the again this is in in a vacuum this is it just didn't start one Trump got elected\nI Am again it does not comport with the environment that we've lived in uh what what's being broadcast in how we live in and I don't think it I think it goes beyond just being in the mid west or the average American has a different experience it it it's I'm Sorry they're they're\nAll ... arm now are All right that are ...\nI you know when I say the what I say the fourth
