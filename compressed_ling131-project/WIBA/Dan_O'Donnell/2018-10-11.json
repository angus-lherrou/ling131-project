I just don't know what I don't get\nWhen I I mean good thinking people and it was like within my family they are smart people highly educated a very successful and they they just doubled down on the on the a progressive narrative\nAnd I send them have you looked at the case have you're listening to the testimony have you looked at the backgrounds not even a ... the lack of cooperation as an utter lack of substance within the story I I have now moved to I don't believe her\nBut but for some reason now the definition is you must believe her and you must prove yourself innocent\nI'm very glad Kavanaugh is on that to the court on black very glad now he's just his cabinet very glad about that\n\nBut I Do believe somebody is going to say enough do enough and screaming up and say we go low enough that the cycle is going to get out there and pull a trigger let me give you a reality from yesterday\nA guy with the bomb in his car was in the house I'm not sure upstate New York\nOn election day he was going to drive down to DC and detonate himself and the vehicle somewhere\nA ... a prominent and they see it and figure it out of that yet but there was a plan that was a there was a FBI did a great job on this\nThank God\nBut I found that amazing because I was watching a lot of local stations or when this first broke and nobody would point out the guy's a party or ideology it was like oh it's crazy you spoke to you know he's anti Trump you know he is\nA and\nBy the way if there was a white if there were white shoe laces and the guy shoes or the white supremacist would have been brought up if I was wearing black votes to white supremacist or what have been brought up obviously they know there's a different political paradigm here but they refused to report it\nThat's what I was talking about yesterday if this guy was a white supremacist at Tea Party member you recall a few years ago a and he's he's part of the Tea Party unbelievable or a guy in Germany a couple of years ago um Middle Eastern guy he ... the lights up by a McDonald's\nOr had white laces it could be a white supremacist now is he was from certain ... certain theology hate to bring that up I I don't want to make anybody angry let's not offend it's not offensive it's talking about facts\n\nAnd facts in this country is that we have a a an army of young people who are ... miss educated\nI'm under educated uh and\nAnd they're offered one political power diamond class every day is happening not only in college but the high school junior high and grammar I can see it just says your guest today man yeah yeah no good\nNo good how do we stop this\nHow do we uh interfere with this story do we do we move to a a a reality that I don't\nWant to see I don't want to see fighting in the streets I don't want to see a a a is ridiculous of behavior taking place I don't want to see that but the Democrats seem to be encouraging that it seems like they want the civil war prior to this election\nAnd miss Clinton jumped off the cliff Feinstein jumped off the cliff Nancy jumped off the cliff Eric Holder they're all hard right now\nYou need to get in the face of a Republicans of people you disagree with and you you need to uh get in the face and disrupt and get in the face of people that don't believe in what we believe it could you do me a favor Hillary could you tell me what the hell you believe in and this is why would lose if you pointed out what you want\nAnd I'm I'm here to put up a fight gal that you could call me crazy\nKnow you've got to pick a home and he's with those ... and you're using a lot of powder but I'm not going anywhere anytime soon it is ah sixteen past the hour um what are you going to do it got to do at the ballot box you gonna get more active politically um\nI don't know what to recommend I just say the ballot box is the best way to go right now a three to one Thirteen tents for each one thirteenth ... free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten and argue blown away by the media coverage is just outrageous absolutely outrageous non existent they encounter ratio\nAnd there's talk Thirteen Gen WIP it [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] we remember back in just changed mine when the time\nI just want to be my own not in a gal that\nMe I I see ah I I I see Governor Scott Walker reelected died that that's that's my belief that it's a tough race yeah uh but I see him getting reelected uh I like shallow but uh you've made a point on this one is well it's a looking very interesting market\nI'm surprised it's not getting more attention because um and I don't have the exact previous poll number but it had it had ... with a very comfortable lead over a Josh call the latest Marquette poll came out and it's got it's got it a forty seven forty three so neither one of them is that fifty and it's it's a lot closer\nThan it than I think a lot of people thought it would be Josh call is a guy that even a lot of liberals who don't know a whole lot about they don't read my drive round here in Madison even you don't see a lot of his science he is I'm\nA former attorney general big lumps loggers or a son and some people don't even realize that part about the guy as well so um it ... this latest Marquette ... it's it's very very interesting\nIt has it has Scott Walker up in ... in the last ... at a five point lead Governor Walker is up on a on a Tony Evers by one percentage point so\nI sat there again that's\nAll right to do and I citing an interesting one for sure I I I you know I have to agree with that at but you and I obviously we're a somewhat opposite and our political beliefs but\nUm I think you and I because of us in radio looking at polls and talking with I I think pretty fair analysts sometimes I just miss ten point lead I always I always say between five or seven is a big one you know seven is a big lead and when everything is said and done it ties in to usually three to five I mean it's a better safer\nAnd I think I think they'll they tend to gives you the the margin of error thing is is is okay let's erase that ... and make it a ... where you've got that five ... I think it's actually a three something percent margin of error by but I think that that gives you when you see ten in a poll Hugo all that comfortable lead okay\nI'll I'll I'll I'll accept your numbers I won't accept your are saying that at any rubber Republicans are not going to lose their ... they're going to maintain power here in Wisconsin they've been ruled they're gonna they're gonna do slam dunks that day and I\nGot I I'm doing I'm doing the best I can I Want to get everybody out there and I I got a question for the audience as we go into the bottom of the outbreak\nAll you no longer speaking to pollsters I I've had two conversations over the last eight and ... you mentioned liberate yourself a black friend of mine a you know everybody's ripping down ... and again I didn't say that this was gonna be the uh the uh the deliverer freedom for a black folks politically here in the country\nBut it's interesting uh the conversation is taking place against ... um and again we have an American reporters overseas and my buddy Kenny ah from Maine as opposed to here on Facebook are pretty bad times pretty interesting times when you are contributed to the Washington Post\nWho is the lord and by the Saudis or any of the building and then we never see him again you know the guys that I mean that's that's just a matter of reality\nUm but the interesting stuff going on there and do they want to light a few of the conflict ration I'd say it's a great question but I owe you no longer speaking to pollsters when they call the house so you know longer taking any surveys and a a a black friend of mine uh recently just said you know Dan I I'm not saying ... my guy but\nI'm tired of what Democrats have done to a city that I Love in several cities across the country\nAnd I'm ... you know the rule is in my house is supposed to vote Democrat and he's getting tired of that is a very interesting conversation got to take a break thirty for past the hour that's the one and only Sean ...\nThis is the kind of ratio news talk thirteenth WMBA\nFox News I'm Krista posture what was hurricane Michael's moving through the Carolinas now leaving behind miles of devastation through the Florida Panhandle in parts of Georgia at least two people were killed by trees falling on home some people would like to go check on their homes are being asked to stay away a while longer\nWhen you have this type of damage particularly the Mexico beach area the that that looks to be wiped out there's hazardous materials around and there is a gas lines that are broken ...\nAdministrator Brock Long two astronauts are okay we're told after the board admission\nIn the front lift up a Russian rocket lifting off from Catholic stand due to carry messages Nick cake and Russia's I like ... to the international space station but minutes after launching\nThere has been an issue with a certain we're standing back\nOr an engine failure and the crew make for an emergency landing after shop to send it came down a few hundred miles from the launch site sauces Simon oh and this is Fox News [noise]\nFrom the group health cooperative he's continuing\nFor news talk through\nThat with your YV a good\nMorning I'm Terry bell shooting on east Washington avenue and writes street in Madison yesterday afternoon the bullet holes into vehicles and the branch of the county credit unions nobody was hurt a member of the Wisconsin broadcasters association has resigned after appearing in this political ad against how's Canada Randy Brian getting her daughter's father to pay child support\nDid the same thing to his own family Nancy\nDouglas has recently elected chairwoman she got a lot of backlash for a period of political ads\nGovernor Walker is issuing an order that allows the Wisconsin National Guard and Red Cross employees who help in the aftermath of hurricane Michael\nFrom the very athletic weather center twenty sevens foreign practice partly sunny windy and fooled by forty six stay connected twenty four seven to ... dot com or from a ...

I think the same thing and and I think you mentioned the righteousness\nI think one of the things that that I think it's troubling and it kinda gives credit to to the point is I think we all feel that that\nWe're righteous and that in that our ... our way is the right way and it and it it adds to a rigidity then I don't think it was always there is that I I think we used to be able to kind of flexing listen a little more whereas now it's we are very ... you know you ever having\nBeen telling you this I ever have a conversation with somebody that doesn't agree with you it's very hard to to talk now with people that don't have the same position as you\nWell I got hit by a bottle in front of Seventy first precinct when they grow up with protest and and you know cut my arm a little bit and you know we returned\nAnd [noise] I Would say an appropriate use of force and it turned out turned turned out to be a donnybrook I was very very interesting ... clashes with the New York eight in front of Seventy first bracing\nAnd um I can tell you right now it it's interesting I'm I'm hearing folks should not a time in prison I get your point I Know what you're saying is if people are locked into believing that they are right and uh they're doing the right let's go to Scott who is I've been very patient on line one Hey Scott how are you doing ... for the call\nVery good uh well if if your if your ideology is righteous why do you have to why why do you have to create the worries why do you have to have the\nFourth estate or run interference for the Democratic National Committee or why does that happen so\nUh I disagree I'm very flexible um I'm willing to listen I'm willing to argue but I'm not going to sit and argue about points in fact that if they're already proven\nUm you know whether it's global warming or communist uh they history there I I don't eat the now that I'm not going to suffer fools and if someone doesn't like that well tough you should educate yourself\nAnd I I I find you remind me a little bit of my dad\nUm when you say you don't suffer fools this man and literally would go for metamorphosis and just walk out of the room he just he can't be connected to that level of stupid\nAnd um I and but he was a good debate or he didn't listen to the debate but when it devolved into a talking points in rhetoric and anger he would just say listen you know I I I just need not to have this conversation right now because we were moving into a stupid area\nAnd it ends up paying weight level waste\nOf a waste of time we're regarding the sixties and seventies no I'm only fifty three going to be turning to run for however you know I I Am a student of history\nI listen to my father and my father in law who uh uh grew up went to school one was in the national guard during that time that time period [noise]\nUm so uh I and they both would say it is very different because uh shots right there there was a a righteous movement there there was this uh\nUh there wasn't this right and wrong there with the violence ... some of it was full meant that of course by some of their various people that are in charge now ironically we're fighting against the man and out there they are the map\nThat's from an impulse talk on but it'd be a perfect example of a of that um it's do a much softer certain\nPhrase I think my mom is an escape mode\nAnd I ever solo said I ... I\nDown for a couple of hours how good she has the front of the U.S or\nWe'll see how that works a welcome back everybody three two one Thirteen cents for each one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten very interesting phone call by Scott and rich I'm going to pick up on a sec here um or even Sean ... found that call interesting there's a there's a lot to be said\nFor a being patient listening and at the same time you realize there's an agenda here that they don't want to talk they don't want to have a fair exchange\nUm and the belief in the righteousness of a antifa and uh I like say in the fine but I digress and the FAA and the Braves you did find the point interesting you might take issue with\nIt is I I I don't I don't agree with it with Scott and I tried to pick 'em up and he hung up for that to to to talk more about it I don't believe in the poll manipulation stuff but I think one of the\nOne of the the the things that people like I Would say is okay well that the polls are being manipulated my question would be well why is it than that Scott Walker is doing so well in these polls and and being tab show\nThat more Republicans in this most recent market bull why is it that they're saying showing that more Republicans were were asked surveyed than Democrats\nThe why ants thing was answered by Scott which I thought was great which was\nFollowed the money is is if you're able to divert or the money to a different horse the money from Leah Vukmir to Scott Walker here in the state or nationally to another congressional race that may be again I don't I don't buy the ... the polar Boulder or manipulated he I I just don't make sense to me\nTo me though I I Would suggest that if you look at the sampling from some of the big one's a ... you know they're in New York just standing outside of NYU Columbia end or calling these people um many can say that the Republicans I'll give you a good example James call me and uh\nI'm I'm suspected Mr Mahler but I'll hold my\nUh my opinion on that but that James Comey is a classic example of progressive who had an R next to his name because he was in law enforcement that's why did it um\nAnd again I I I support the troops that are behind the men and by what you know when he was willing to throw some people onto the bus\nAnd a guy named McKay but not too happy with them pretty interesting um but I digress a we've got rich on hold forever and I'm sure he's going to be very aggressive about a certain subject here so let me get him on the air hey rich how you doing you're on the day because we got a buddy Dave out right after that as well hey rich welcoming\nAnd retail\nAgree with you about the old ... you just can't even when you ask a question you know we are done by groups I mean\n[noise] Marquette you know basically just one of their professor for having a conservative tweak so yeah I mean as far as that goes and people forget all you have to tell them it's made that the Democrats fought against civil rights I mean\nThey did the big switch can actually yeah yeah it's at at the best I looked great um but\nI was going to find out anything about a Christopher aid money ... with that but\nThey're still monitoring the president calls\nYeah both I call yeah and it's um and I believe a Christopher Rice testimony and there's a couple of stories that are going to break I Believe by tonight or tomorrow\nOr I mean we already got the uh the testimony of the council for the FBI and his name just flew out of my head in a bigger bigger\nSpeaker so um\nThat's going to be a went all this disconnected I Believe the or the house of cards is falling right now and I'm a I'm a I'm excited to see what's washes out but I'm hoping my instinct to correct a Baker has said to himself no way I'm going down with the ship here's my testimony here you go\nI'm very interesting stuff taking place where it's you know I Know you're still out there for a vote we're everyday working hard aren't you\nAlways have you got to ask people are you better now than you weren't you weren't you know fighting in the streets for the next six years or two years but not much to getting out of the great\nIf if they actually did not read it to him and actually tried to make a deal with them that's what he does you about that I worked with all white they could get a lot done\nAnd by the way that he wouldn't make deals he would make deals that I probably wouldn't like but for the sake of politics and politics has been defined over the years American politics has been defined over the years as the world of compromise\nAh sometimes I think that's the ... people a little too eager to do that and uh sometimes you've got to take the hitting the down with the ship or that being said yeah you got people in positions of power and prestige and and and attention a human nature is a very interesting dynamic are ill when everyone\nThinks they walk away from the table getting what they want it yeah you got to give them the right [noise] right and I am I doing\nAll right rich you just fell into a tunnel so again to what we're going to move on to our thanks for the call appreciate it pal\nOr let's go go to the much maligned journey Illinois our buddy Dave and we're talking about politics I Know again today but uh it's uh but the amount of time between now twenty six days of the country could change dramatically the investigations go away\nOr the truth goes away the documents go away I Want to see them I suspect of what took place prior to the election as a as a ... as a candidate and as president elect\nOf some bad things happen I Want to find out what it was they walk on my friend take your time for your call yeah\nAnd let's remember Dan politics is the one thing the ... that does affect our lives sports\nNever affects our life's really are but this subject is always it affects our our pocketbook kids at a fast down or we go about our daily business you were talking about the uh the difference between like the sixties protests and protests of today and then Michael Savage ... book\nMichael Savage is an expert on this and obviously he was there\nI was there I was very young I was young but the thing is there were two things going on at that time you had the you hit the civil rights movement going on and then you have the Vietnam War\nThe Vietnam War took a whole generation of young people I was on the cusp of the uh the draft to to go into Vietnam so you know I I probably age I mean I didn't know I didn't really want to go after war\nAnd I have a whole different mindset now because of my age but\nThe fact is now people are manufacturing ... protest they have all these social issues that they push like it's the like it's the end of the earth but it really is and it's been almost a ... it's because of boredom\nThey have to have something to protest against so\nThey're ... they they either have a union or non profit or mommy and daddy paying the bill for them to fly all of the country and protest I e mad as he has a a a Chicago and New York and Washington\nAnd what is what it is what it what it turned into Dan is we're self destructing because\nYou look for something to protest so what do you do you have you have that venom of the sixties you have these people that are teaching the kids\nThat have that venom from the sixties and want to remain young so they passed this venom off to the youth in the schools and they give they try to get them false protests to\nTo to latch onto that youth and that and as soon as he has some well then the only place you have to go is to tear down the\nFifteen ten WNBA here\nDon't agree with a show and all that much but uh you brought up something that I I thought was relevant and uh Columbus was not a good guy a crappy good viewing resources and\nI'm bringing a kind of I\nMean with guns and horses and stuff that these people didn't know how to fight again I'm yeah who who felt they were not and and and ... fairly discovered\nThat return either I mean is popular already there\nI mention the word uh probably discovered workers America\nHas been suggested for many years that was it read it over\nThe other thing is that record look at it in perspective like I'm Robert Rupp back that I I don't think people realize like it's ... ... American indian can bite against each other and and and\nYeah the ... the the treadmill I enter a\nYeah enter the answer a change between tribes river and a lot of kidnapping a lot of slavery and a lot of uh claiming women to be there as again it was a culture that met or the European culture and they felt the response should be swept Savage and hard\nBut they're also a lot of treaty signed it the way the way the honored forever no it's again a bad history\nUm and then\nGo ahead I'm Sorry I I just think at the time they were much harsher and different than they are now it's Raqqa to look back and got someone or to take a statue down I mean the burning of itself after the civil war was not necessarily a good thing you know but the New Yorkers looked at like\nYou know the saviors of of our country and and things that went on you know after the civil war we're we're not good\n[noise] ah ... you know the crow laws and a lot of the uh the insider who are elected there are elected a black officials and after the war or they last about two years and then some of the laws that were created wipe them out that politically there was just out a lot of outrageous things were done Don I Can't deny that and I I Want to keep moving here thank you for your time doc\nI'm let's go to George has been very patient on line\nTo hey George how you doing you're on the economy shell thanks for your time go right ahead\nSean I ... I'm Sorry Dan how you doing by doing okay doing okay yeah I got a\nComment and question my comment is I don't know if you watch the today show but this morning Michelle Obama was on it and they were\nAround or else yeah actually I didn't get around ... yup oh\nWell I thought though she could've fed right and she was real nice Robert block she could have said let's stay\nGoing when they go low we go high and don't live to Hillary and why didn't she just said that\nAnd I'm never going to help them yet never going to happen I thought I'm going to\nSay I sort of well I have mixed feelings about that they said please stay at least for the good of our country but then I don't see it because if she does than we can use it in our campaigns 'cause I mean you know I felt about it on his way up but the other question I hear the question was why are these parents\nKeep sending their kids to these universities and colleges that were founded on Christian beliefs\nDo a noted these different universities now just kick out a copycat Democrats so jaded\nWith Ani George a lot of people don't know I still don't know that the Boston College actually a Catholic college nobody even knows that anymore it's just a ...\nWhy do you have to pay the money to send their kids to read it was\nAbout how about a politician given a speech and they feel like they have to cover a crucifix or cover a saint a while to run the church is I mean it's just to me it's where's your respect I've been into I I I've been into that you can't go away into a mosque but I've been there show respect\nAnd ah I was in Moore a synagogues and temples or as a kid with more than a guy with the more ... than a\nConfirmations when I was a kid and a ... I was taught tolerance I was taught to appreciate the Menorah there ... and we've seen Israel ... only Jewish friends come out sing some Christmas songs mine is a bit of music\nAnd they just appreciate is Matt and just but it seems like that's not being taught today if it might be offensive if you bring the Menorah and if you might be offensive\nIf if you bring a or anything representing the Muslim faith\nOr the to me it's you know if you're teaching you learn it or you might want some truth and say wow that's something that a theology over there you might say that\nAnd again nobody has to say that about the Catholic Church right now I'm In it and you know I Believe the pope we have right now a very strange guy but I'll put it that way and I think is very left of center then he comes out with a conservative comment\nUm he's he's bizarre he's a bizarre guy I'm not a big fan to be honest uh three two one oh my heavens we owe you a big break preach I'm Sorry about that three two one Thirteen ten three two one searching ten toll free\nEight seven seven to three five Thirteen tend to account ratio news talk Thirteen tent WNBA [noise]\n\nLawsuit some Chris posture there is widespread devastation and the Florida Panhandle home after home blown apart in Mexico beach where hurricane Michael made landfall yesterday today the focus is search and rescue\nWe prayed that's already in states say governor Rick Scott there's major damage it tend to air force base is a couple of hours ago nine hundred thousand homes and businesses were without power from Florida the Carolinas that's where the storm is centered now at least two people have died in the storm Chinese government says the case against young June shoe is made out of thin air\nShe was charged yesterday in Cincinnati, Ohio with attempting to steal trade secrets from American Aviation and aerospace companies just waiting experts to travel to China asking them to give talks universities when the real purpose was to obtain information even extradited from Belgium earlier this week the case\nComes amid growing wide attention which leads us\nSimon and Mrs Fox news\nLive from the group health cooperative he's continuing\nFor news talk through\nGet what you want to be a\nGood morning I'm Terry ... for young people are in jail this morning accused of beating up a woman's ceiling her car last night happen Arnold Dana road Madison police say the joy writers ... are on some of the highway two hours later\nThe latest market hold with Scott Walker and Tony ... and a statistical tie in the governor's race offers of high one point forty seven forty six percent within the rules margin of error senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin attorney general ... lead their race\n... learn how to cut hair while the man in prison for burglary he went on to own one hundred cost cutters franchises in the Madison area raised a lot of money for charity whiskey died Monday he was Seventy four\nFrom the very athletic weather center twenty somethings ... partly sunny windy and cold ... stay connected twenty four seven ... from\n... center I'm Gerry bell\nJoined pray athletic club they filed more than just a health club makes them different ... dot com means\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nThese young ratio and join the conversation that three two one through the toll free one Seventy seven to three by three them up on Facebook and Twitter comeback", "show_name": "Dan O'Donnell", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
