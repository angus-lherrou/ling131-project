I'll get that they most track it down but there isn't it said it just you and I have not served so it's kind of cold just sit back and listen to these guys and gals isn't it\nIsn't as it was by the way officer bill when he called and he said he said can you hear me okay I said yeah he goes I got my phone on my lap so the cops don't\nPull [laughter] smart man I spoke at like a true Chicago cop or a a while you got to watch these cops they'll get you every time [laughter]\nAnd ah\nAll right you don't want to take a break and uh I got a question for you for taking breaks your pre already a Mr ... who is a journalist for the Washington Post who's a Turkish citizen and\nYou're hearing a lot of discussion from the administration um what we may potentially do the wrong thing pops up the obviously the Saudis are clearly involved here um\nPreviously stepping into something that ... where we don't belong I'm hearing way too much conversation about us intervening or or taking a strong ... definitive action uh last time I checked this guy was a Turkish citizen is he not maybe I'm missing something here\nUm I again I think the uh if you're a member of the press and you're gonna think I'm saying I'm saying this but you know that's a special um that's a special appointment if you will the American journalist is a very very special thing\nAnd many of them who have surrendered their objectivity and decided to become members of the fourth estate I I still hold hope that the uh uh that the uh constitutionally protected profession comes back in a way where they just doing their job but are you worried about getting involved is something we shouldn't be getting involved and\nKnow I I I think the ... the I guess she our a living I guess he lived\nIn the United states we lived with that one of the Carolinas yeah reporter for an American paper and I don't know exactly if he was you know\nPart of the the point is you can't kill journalists and and you need to\nDo yeah I Do want was troubling to me was the president's immediate response and is going to sound terrible Dan but the reality is he didn't wait I don't think waited adequately long enough to get or a Saudi responses immediate ... when he was talking about\nThis this is somebody else I went rogue killers or something with this thing and the Saudis had a plan in place to say listen it was an interrogation gone wrong in in ... gosh it sounds terrible to say this and but that's the excuse and whether it wasn't intentional or an accident\nThat's like one of those things that okay it's plausible it's the middle east there's dangers there's interrogations these type of terrible things happen to reporters but to come out and say well it's ... ... it's now they're kind of bio mass yeah it it's\nUm yeah you're saying that Donald Trump might have a given a knee jerk reaction here before we get all the facts\nIs that what you're saying ... I'm going to say I want the guy in ... I'm not going to step in that\nBut even but even not even the facts but even before we had the uh the the uses is um I I think and I think a lot of us basically believe that that he was he was murdered that this wasn't an accident this was all intentional um but because of the way\nInternational relations occur um sometimes there's casualties sometimes horrible things are done and it needs to be presented in a\nIn a in a way that in a way that satisfies all sides maybe not a hundred percent per se and and by firing off tweet immediately and makes it a bigger issue and now we're having concerns and questions about Saudi Arabia in our relationship\nWhen I Am with you I Am with you as far as what a journalist and their impact and in the United states is a constitutionally protected the profession and to me it's an important profession\nI'm now again we can I can have my complaints all day long about members of our uh the American journalism community\nBut at the end of the day I still have this weird I mean let's be honest at the one thing that's going to come out of this is the brilliance of the amount of the American intelligence ... intel and spying community is wrong with that there's only oh this event and I think that we Americans know exactly what happened ... there's no doubt oh yeah my mind we know exactly what happened\nI'm In a tent for the Saudis come out and if you will see daisy alright that started the chainsaw\n... okay yeah\nThat's not an accidental you don't bring a change to an interrogation last time I checked\nBut I but I think that's the thing though is is but that's but that's the plausible deniability because it's not like the United states government is going to release that that apple that I watch ... yeah I get this ... went and bought I feel terrible about is I'm literally saying the United states needs to do a better job of covering this stuff up is this stuff happens\nIt's around ... is the United states needs to do a\nProve prove Donald Trump is right to go to Madison ... dot com [laughter] and you look at the economy right now and it'll be just wrapped up into a problem and it will be totally awesome into\nA a ... I uh I I'm just uh I I I get worried about a president that when he ran on a certain message him and he said listen last time not to get involved and now you have an American general who's in harm's way in Afghanistan and we have Afghani police and um the people who are involved\nAnd you know it just that the radicals easily turned and the radicals in the ranks of a lot of these countries that we've helped we spent a lot of money on a lot of treasure a lot of fortune\nAnd um we have needs at home a lot of people did recognize a great message from Donald Trump saying you know what we got to re think a lot of these engagements we got to re think a lot of these are getting involved moments and I and I hope\nThe president doesn't get caught in a trap here I I Hope the he's able to eventually say listen we've done all we can in certain parts of the world it's time to wrap it up time to rethink a rethink things and and move away didn't he run out that I mean honestly that's a that's why I'm I was a a\nUm it listen I Know I was not a Trump supporter when it when the primaries but again I was not a Trump supporter by the end of the primaries are I had to make a decision and ... and ... and grasp it and own it when I made the decision\nAnd if the guy makes a mistake or if I disagree with them I don't mind a pointed that out\nUm and again these these budgets I I'm telling you this debt again when everything else comes down to mid turns or over\nUm when the terms or a behind us I'm telling you right now a lot of conservatives like like me you're going to say okay now what are we doing about the debt by you know we're paying the debt that we have a record amounts of tax revenue and uh we're collecting a lot of do hear that should be going through what paying down the debt\nI'm I just think it's a healthy practice\nAnd I think it was Andrew Jackson was he'd last want to say All right well our books to clear I think it might have in the last guy to actually have pure clear books by the time he was done even though he's not um [noise] uh I I don't know I just I I I I\nCan't change my priorities I Can't change my opinion and I can't change my stance on this stuff for the sake of the the fact that I think the president's doing a lot of really good things I think he's been a great president\nUm if you if you look at what he's accomplished over the last two years and you pretend that there was a de after his name do you think Vilonia Trump would be disrespected at the level she's disrespect\nRight now I Know what happened do you think that video would have been made of Vilonia Trump the at being portrayed as a stripper in front of the desk by the way I Know she was a model I Know she took some adult shots but when you look that good ah that's part of the industry\nWhat what ... what happened to our art artistic uh open minded and intellectuals who are coming from academia or ... or ... she'd be a lot and what not you know ... or ... it seems is only so much ignorance and hypocrisy I can take\n'em again we're we're the celebrations of this immigrant a first lady who was a businesswoman and our own rights who was successful in our own right a generated millions of dollars of her own wealth in her own right speak several different languages or is just an incredible uh ambassador I Believe for the United states as first lady\nUm [noise] I don't know I'm at a point now where I'm just I it's incredible how the meat I I'm just really starting to feel sorry for the first lady I I think she's being treated horribly I really do let's go to Bob then we'll take our bottom of the outbreak hey Bob how you doing you're on the day and kind of ratio happy Thursday Thursday to you about\nYeah just to get back to this ah this ah Saudi thing that you you were talking about um I was going to say I listen to rush yesterday and you're you're you're usually takes talking points from you\nKnow John rash makes it a point to let's say ...\nBut um he actually do any eight and a lot of the facts and this thing especially about the apple watch a ... a turkey is that a friend of ours as far as their medication goes I agree I'm the Saudis we have a serious financial and defense interests with us as we do with turkey but\nThis is in on their in their their countries the singer problem and I don't know I don't care if a journalist or not it's not the United states is probably let them deal with it and I don't I hopefully when you were talking about before\nA somebody gets blamed for this um the United states\nThat's all I Know that they'll they'll pick a couple of a guilty parties I'm shocked a go round up the usual suspects and there's going to be able to lose is you\nKnow started in a place where they still got people has publicly\nYeah yeah it can only do it now that he's all the time\nAnd you know people forget if you think about Iran\nIran was a very cosmopolitan or advocated business oriented oriented country\nWonderful people I had some of the first immigrants come to my school in Brooklyn and a great people great business people end up it'd be and live the American dream almost immediately and um it it there's a population around right now ready to do the right thing\nThey had a shot with the president or\nPresident Obama he decided not to take too much action I guess it's it was his choice\nIt's very unfortunate what you know as as happening there but uh I guess we see the same thing about a mile a thoroughly modern nation and a ... you know a a fair a fairly modern nation salt of our border you know that um [noise] uh [noise] you\nKnow could could be something but uh it's just over you know overrun by crime so uh\nUh the corruption is part of the culture that's the problem and they now not wink wink that that has to come to an end it's just it's a fever is second nature and then when it comes naturally it's very difficult to put down\nUm bop reshape the call we got to

I'm Sorry preview on a couple of say a couple of things\nQuestion as yeah\nQuestion with this had to do with I guess was ... what kind of concerns me is like whether it was Daniel Pearl being beheaded in in um uh by drawing a blank right now where he was a a Pakistan or or or whether it's ... you know we can't allow journalist and this guy was the Washington Post comes\nWe we ... we can't allow journalists to be killed and the other thing that that the question I have is what does this say about we always talk about respect for the United states\nThat that such a bold assassination would take place I mean the guy is on camera walking in what is that what did the Saudi Government I think we were going to do or did they think we would we wouldn't do anything that they were so emboldened to do such a such a brazen attack\nI I hate to be cold about this but there was a cold stark difference between an American citizen and somebody who is not an American citizen\nAnd a un American journalist Daniel Pearl I'm Sorry doesn't measure up to Mr ... show gay I understand your concern you need and what he's been trying to accomplish over the years and majority has been something has been getting after and challenging some very evil regimes I'm I'm I'm with you on that ... what\nI think the cold breakdown for many people here in the U.S is he's not one of ours\nWhen he's a Washington Post columnist I mean he and he lives in the United states\nI get that I ... brother I get that and I'm with you and I heard a business if if we're broadcasting somewhere overseas I certainly want to be protected by the other sovereign nation where we're at um a but it it is it cold to say I prefer asking the question is it cold just said he's not a U.S citizen\nOr you know it's not our housekeeping which is a I I get that I ... and the the journalism and the impact I'm with you I I'm with you on that um\nBut uh it is a is the break down a little bit to ice cold for your praise I\nDated as I Know there's dangerous but again I I to me it's just again the fact that he has such a strong connection and states and the fact that they did it so brazen leave that they did a um I mean they are ... and maybe I Would like getting the president's\nSeriously one of us that it could be one of us that easily as well but if they're they're\nNot respecting it to me it's a disrespectful thing to think\nYou know I I'll stay with us we'll go to John in Janesville has been very very patient hey Jon welcome you're on the down economy show happy Thursday to my friend\nThat I was shaking sending troops to rush to play in church they're headed towards the Guatemalan border just\nTerrible I mentioned that on the news um I don't know I really don't know a male dot com and you can see the so called black right good on by the way\nLet me let me give the daily mail another of a a a little credit here or there was pointing out some very very specific items about this young

yet I Can't report on it yet\nDon't know and I and I think sometimes we over simplify the middle east like we've got a caller coming up uh that that's going to point something out and um I think widely in the American media has been broadcast as the absolute negative there are certain parts and aspects that may not be the the the worst for the middle east so\nUm I think I think and I I think that this stuff in in one of my difficulties\nWith some of the ... when I come and doesn't is their ... the the Middle East is a such a complex place you mentioned earlier the enemy of my enemy is my friend and and that type of stuff goes on so regularly and it's not all my guy and there's\nYou know factions within factions that some of them are are you know look at like the mess in Syria of who's you know young aligned oh man it's messy so I'm I all I Would say again is is this guy's a reporter for an American papers so I think we've got here\nI you know you bring up the reality of uh she uh\nAnd uh um uh what's the other one's Shia and um why don't I just had on my head oh I'm [laughter] two different Muslim factions and I'm at\nThe two biggies but but then you have the language of Arabic a posh soon or do uh I I mean this tribal approach is going to be taking place well after we're off this earth I truly believe that I'm On until it you know everybody's self destruct that's one of those come to an end\nAnd a Shia and Sunni that she and certainly that's what I'm thinking of an accent I nobody said to me and I\nI I Know it's to me that and I nobody sent that to me came to my

W. W. up you can uh uh Shaun sorry about that occurred uh uh once again we have another heavyweight or a bomb that we can't allow and current I Know you were just in the midst of if you're a stream of thought there\nAnd again the downside of today in Congress shows you really do feel like you're at the end of the bar with me oh we can't let the current that'll hurt a show and Dan let me make that very very clear if a curse like that gets out over the that'll hurt showing and damn we can't allow that I Know is this history of the ... and ... you and I will talk that way all the I promise I'm\nA Kurdish suggesting that this man was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nUm is it a now I guess to members ah um is it an analogous to Russia if you want a member of the Communist Party at a certain point\nYou were pretty much shining your own death warrant a that's a question that needs to be asked a and again Kurt brings up that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood which turned out to be really the uh the genesis of a lot of the radicalism does across the world today\nAre no doubt about it as as the legitimate point is this guy and the various and eh we go to back to a um the original phone call today which I Believe was just before Scott I'm who's that first phone call and I'm trying to figure that its self serve failed than uh\nThan Bob uh and uh then Scott I'm pointing out some very legitimate things you know if sovereign nations gets it gets to get to take care of business I'm\nVery very interesting let's go to a who's our next call I hear a show and I don't wanna screw this up oh our buddy Jeff in a banana republic\nWho was a jet thank you thank you Sean appreciate that Jeff welcome I there's not a big clip for me I think ah the market has not scaring me too much today and that a little selling off leveling on taking some profits not a bad thing I was a little correction there I think it's not even a correction\nNot even close with every clue we did not you know we didn't even reach correction levels you're actually\nNo God but God in fact I was just what they're going to show a truck was about three and a half percent down ... I mean that's that's I Know and it's it's interesting I watch\nThe headlines on a lot of these news things on line and they used the word like plunged and giant sell off and all these you know a\nLittle ... and so forth a state that they would never ride under Brock Obama it's still a little\n... absolutely ridiculous\nUm first of all I have to laugh I uh if you're sitting here trying to cap the memories urged [laughter] here at my age ... think of the same thing with chemicals that guy's name I Can't\nRemember [laughter] but you know I've had\nBrain surgery I'm ... I had radiation of brain surgery I have a beautiful excuse you got to admit ...\nYeah I I did too I uh kinda got Mac and they hit a few times too many anyway I think this whole situation with with the ... to me it doesn't pass the smell test All right number one why would the Saudis do this we're there close allies\nThey don't have any common enemy with a ... ah that have been battling on our side you know supporting us in the middle east why the heck would they ... you know a justify how could they possibly justify even think that it would pass here in the U.S\n[noise] but I let me let me push back a little bit Jeff how many members of the nine eleven attack was run in fact Saudis\nI think all but what three two\nOr three ... three maybe two or three\nYeah and I did there was a vein there is a pulse there is a thread that that uh you know not not wink wink we we can pay a billion on top and let the\nLet their fellows are who are willing to die I light up\nAnd put put you put that into the mix but that the ... in the bowl\nAnd on top of that remember there are opponents inside Saudi Arabia a ... of the of the current regime there yes so my question on the thing is like I have a sneaking Hodge and I went to the guy was a Muslim Brotherhood or not I am a sneaky hunch that are common enemy\nColder ran has got their fingers in this that that they would that if they could just you know a separate us from the ... it would put them in a hell of a better position in the middle east elevate them to to the supremacy so I don't\nKnow I I I don't hesitate to walk back you up on that suspicion I it's always a legitimate suspicion but I Will say this\nWhy is the er the monarchy they're willing to love kind of the point that the ... the uh the sun the prince and uh and maybe he was involved and I think there's going to be a couple of sacrificial lambs down the road here by probably next week\nUm and you know you're doing\nYou're assuming that the print ... had his hand in it [noise]\nI mean I like you know we see how often where top generals and a much too in various countries assassinate you know even even our own these are trained officers policemen that we train and suddenly they turn their gun on us literally\nAnd kill a few advisors I just that whole mess there is so complex I don't\nAnd I have never met any of that word I a Jeff I hate admitting to that word and and when we heard President Trump on the campaign trail say you know it's time to time to wash your hands of a lot of stuff here um I wasn't completely against that idea to be quite Frank well but the\nDifference is the difference in the middle east though is you've got a regime in Iran that is actively pursuing nuclear weaponry yes we have to have a presence there we have to do something there we just cannot wash your hands\nUh you know in in in Afghanistan and Pakistan and you've got who was the guy's name that was giving advice to North Korea and developing their north their nuclear facilities so yup that's\nNow shortage of rainy in a no shortage and by the way we have the intel we've seen Iranian officials in North Korea\nOr there has been a plenty of evidence of that coming out as well or Jeff you use common sense\nAnd you are you bringing the Iranian question I think it's a very legitimate question\nCool I'd like to point out that are radical Islam hurt the Saudi royal even more than you're American Girl the Israelis and the Saudis are more threatened by them or we or group is rarely\nA Craig ...
