Mike how you doing you're on the day in Congress show happy terrible Tuesday to your ...\nOr do I think it's a big thing about people you know live and be proud to live in the United states now moved here I got Thirty years ago and I was young kid coming from Germany and you know but you know you're always blame you for the second World War and you always have to live with this and there was no trying\nRight now they're doing the same thing here sometimes if people doing well\nBut in the U.S and all that stuff so there and all that well we can't go back in time you want to move forward and now people when you feel proud\nThat'd be I'm sure it's a great country and I\nI I I find it amazing that they're seven thousand people heading towards a country where they and their supporters and and ... and they're they're encouraged years\nSaying well America so bad look look how mean and and just they treat their immigrants Harley yeah keep making your way there because you are leaving a pile of feces\nUm especially in South America I mean I mean look at Venezuela come on I mean one of the greatest comedies on the face of the yard yeah we're we're oil rich we can everybody can get a taste of your work hard but you know what socialism is probably a better idea\nAnd that that didn't work out too well for them\nAnd you know what by the way um I felt bad but what I was in the ... and I went to I was in um uh an Obama guy now and and uh again several different parts of Germany and I really notice the sense of\nA almost a shame or a you know there's a lack of pride and I hope that is changing because it's a great country and it's a great culture\nAnd um and again it's you know I'm there as a tourist I understand I I don't get the uh the inner workings um but I felt bad for a lot of the people there who just you know they kind of look down and they look away and I'm like no that's you know it's a you didn't do this and other you know several generations ago did that\nAnd it's um it's um go ahead and like\nOh well we aren't we have the same in the past the thing is we're\nTrying to change it you know a minute ago already gone we ... we don't have a back you know move forward you know you don't have now and\nThe future you know and you can only make it better\nAnd you don't and I might give everyone I'm ...\nI'm an American citizenship I caught myself American because the lift your longer than other than Germany or ... you know like to go back and visit but I tell you about every time I visit I Can't wait to get back to your back on the air you know what\nAm I Am I Am the ugly American and my nanna you know who is European immigrant you know she would always say you yanks don't understand what you have you you people didn't no longer understand what you have here in the states and you're going to lose a she said that very often\nAnd I and I hope she's not right I Hope she's not correct on that Mike and it's a capital down my my my two flawed but it's the best system out there\nQuestion it's and again well said it might be flawed but it's still the best thing on the face of the earth right now my great call appreciate your time and there's nothing like speaking to an immigrant to help you realize what you have in this country got to take a break that's the one and only shown people this is that they encounter ratio news talk thirteenth\nAnd if you don't speak English and you'll end in the United states and you wind up on a street corner with a box in any major city in the U.S and yeah you're allowed to put that box they're legally say right you know the rules and regulations kind of shut people down doesn't it but um if you put a box anywhere and you've got to you bought some hats wholesale guess what you're going to make a buck that day\nAnd the economy is a is humming or the economy's in the right direction the economy now admitted by a economists from MSNBC and CNBC have said\nYeah you know what what what we're we're really uh we're ... we're starting to see a change I we hate Donald Trump now yeah this is totally Obama to Obama's credit you don't get it both ways\nUm if you if you said the economy's not good yes I Would then you wouldn't you also give Obama blame see that's where they talk to both sides of the amounts of gas or the rest of America ... besides us lunatics are listening to talk radio I listen to a great talk show host like baking McKenna Rush Limbaugh\nSean Hannity and we we we pay attention to the news every morning on Madison in the morning right here on news talk Thirteen ten WNBA we're interested we care\nBut we're finding more and more people don't care and they get that that social media message to light their views they go on the emotion they go on the anger and they listen to these B. S. or narratives absolute lives could da\nDa da da da dum dum a Chris was listening on I heart radio posting on Facebook at the Donald Trump say you're going to get tired of winning you you were going to win so much you gonna get tired\nAnd one thing when he starts to quote numbers and the impact a ... again I I Will see that he exaggerate certain things but it's funny when he talks about numbers ... he's like a ...\nIt's a he he just bang bang you know it was ... he spent on this what's going on there and again ah I I Wish you would look at the deficit I Wish it would look at the debt ah that's going to come back to bite is when I when everything else comes down\nAnd uh again I don't say it's a lot that the Republicans are going to maintain the house and I think Sean ... is right\nYou know we have to weigh energize our base we have to make people or at least have them feel concerned uh but social media\nHas turned a lot of a much mouth mine's a into something that they think they're intelligent they think their sharp they think they're bright and their opinion means everything\nThen Connery every day at least once a day and it's a flawed man I made some mistakes in my life and\nYou know maybe some of the gray hair on my headset yeah you don't want to take a step back take take a deep breath and think out what you just they were well you're about to say um why do I succeed every day no but I'm not I don't have the uh the arrogance to sit here and electric people to the point I I have a conversational show I Love the show\nI Love the fact that they're showing a prevailing gauges me test me every now and I said that's a healthy exercise\nBut what social media and the immediate opinion and the immediate post and the immediate video that is just changes so rapidly so quickly and I think Iraq Obama lax right onto what he knew he was savvy enough to know let me take this digital right here and create enough unrest\nI'm ... I think is one of the greatest example you know Democrats and easier majors ... and then when the governor and they are and when a holder said once we get him indicted whoa tighten up yeah there's a grand jury process and the Missouri\nAnd the grand jury process served itself rather well\nBut uh again when it does it come out your way with yeah I don't play that game and uh what we're going to give the gates that the uh to the barbarians for a little bit but we'll take it back and uh Sean and my hand wringing here am I Am I concerned for no reason it's a I don't\nKnow I Know and and I I I think you're right is it one of the things like the the promise of social media\nHas failed as the promise was that was going to be a place where people could share opinions and get different opinions and in in debate those type of things and you know unfortunately what's happened with social media and why it's failed is\nWe've we've all kind of reinforced are preconceived type of beliefs and it's\nWe don't we don't honestly debate each other we scream at each other on social media the thing that I get the greatest reaction are the most in in ... you know the most and raging in a gang urges that type of you\nI think I think you're on to uh the the threat is going to have that actually I Know I Know the dead end where it's going to stop and that is coverage of people who wouldn't have the courage to say or do what they're saying on social media they would never say that to another human being they wouldn't have the ... and they want to stay in their basement they\nWant to keep doing what they're doing and they realize oh wow and making a lot of people angry and nobody's going to smack the hell out of me I mean this is awesome and um that it's changed a lot of a\nSelf evaluation of people like listen if you don't have the uh the chops to back it up don't say it\nAnd I you know I'm at the show and I know you laugh at me but I'm always willing to take the beating I'm willing to take the a rare and kicking it's I I think it's a healthy way to approach life to be oh you are and some days I don't say it like yeah you don't want to run the modem I don't want to feel like I don't feel like getting punched in the face to Sony ...\n[laughter] well there's so much but it it is is so much I think of of what's lost is I think part you know one of the big things I like about the show is\nYou can't you can't call yourself something unless it's been challenged I it's easy it's easy to say I'm a liberal or I should say I'm a conservative I'm this I'm then it's easy to do that when everybody you talked to has the same opinion it it's it's a little harder when somebody says\nBut why and you know in one yeah things working with you is you'll you'll come to me and say why or is this off as a ... it's to me I think it's an important exercise and I think that a lot of us believe social media was going to be a giant forum for that and it just hasn't turned him down at all\nAnd I'll give you the example of a ... and uh uh you know Twitter and company they've come out and said well yeah there there's clearly a left leaning a ... within the company but we're very very fair\nWell no you're not I'm a anecdotal stories in front of the other day ... friend of mine she lives upstate or she loves\nA driving into the country as she is a a a firearm enthusiast she has a ... a member of a gun club and um she's a political\nAnd she posted a her a score from a range and uh and the the target um she may have posted the firearm and um and again the the post never make it to Facebook they never allow the post it always gets censored they'd get shut down\nUm and again I don't uh ferries language for what you post is like oh I had a good score today and you know that you know ... that I shop at all of the guys I I think it's a pretty innocuous posed yet\nOr somehow some way it's censored and I can tell you that are showing I've been paranoid way before or the revelations came out way before the congressional testimony and I said I've been saying for years haven't I perhaps don't post too much don't say too much because there's\nAn algorithm man hey man there's an algorithm man and cutting the man's going to get ... and ... and have the I've been paranoid for quite some time heaven I\nGuess you have a few Avon that I'll leave it at a yes wait a

in it for a year and a half my algorithm and I don't know just to meet with a big leap it\nSpecifically caters to people that I only ... like the artist and the people I deal with on my personal phone seems to be always in my algorithm it it\nDoesn't make any sense to me other than that I don't know that part bull but I'll I'll finish talking to a couple you know people that represent or a ...

I didn't get the the pay dirt on it but the I I again you get pulled for the first time you think the questions were unfair that's great pointed out\nUm but again I and maybe by virtue of where I grew up on that it's just you know I hear a different accent I Want to learn it almost immediately it may be wrong ended up itself well uh but\nOne of the things in in in ... mentioned too about some of the substance of the polling ... not all the polls are are I don't want to call them illegitimate but there are some the push polls that have a very different\nAh agenda which isn't as much trying to get you to answer a fair question is really to try and get you to be swayed it's literally a manipulative situation we're going back to where you're talking about some political ads trying trying to sway people from voting put aisles do that type of thing as well it's really just\nA you know he goes to the question it goes to the question you know the fact that he stopped beating his wife only five years ago does that bother you or were you still vote for 'em you know that's the question let's go to Dave from the much maligned gurney Illinois they welcome glad to have your long thanks for your time and patients that I pop\nIt in that ah one slogan a job is not the mob\n... that was a that was a trumped right I Believe so yes I Believe so yeah yeah\nYou know that line is okay unless it's coming from a big burly Italian guy and he goes I got a job for you\nThen hey that's the way that you never want to hear those words for him yes I got to get it that's right here in Illinois so you're in Illinois pow don't test or a don't test your safety there\nThat's right yeah I called up about at that point about ah when you're doing a text and then you have a line of a conversation on your text\nAnd they always give me with a three options I'm responses and when you finish your text now or or when somebody responds back to\nI've never hit one of those because I assumed that if I did that but one time they're going to assume that I'm always going to use it obvious they're following me your your line of conversation because they bring you options on how to respond and they're all pretty good option but\nBut I my my suggestion would be never hit that because once you\nYou volunteer to do it they're going to do it all the time yeah\nOnce you do it the guy with a hidden fickle shows up to your house you can read it grows older than me\nAnd go day by appreciate the call thanks for your patience today pound and a and showing people I Want to give you this little

night it's happy time that's why she kind of goes newsy doozy didn't you know\nDidn't Sandra Day O'Connor ... step down from the Supreme Court than to her husband had ... yes absolutely\nYou're absolutely right yeah you're absolutely right\nUm and again you're just you know why is it ... floating the way it is today as opposed to a\nYou know forty years ago ... well you know the old folks that we know Sean ... it didn't seem like they're these epidemic or portions of a\nI'm a ... it just it doesn't it's something's going on here do dad and my dad had it figured out a forty years ago you know what he said was that every everybody's talking about the environmental and the atmosphere it can\nIt's what we're putting in our mouths tour eating it's what we're trying to process through a filthy bodies and uh\nYou know ... this is a guy who really adhered toward the marine corps standard of ... the everyday wasn't you know you didn't uh you know one fifty miles but he did PT in his kitchen everyday leg lifts or\nA push ups off the counter I mean this guy was serious and until is ah you know final months um and you know he had a stroke yeah I'll go get past that and that's what he did he got past that yeah you never knew he had a stroke um\n[noise] and it's a a ... due to the food isn't it the food I mean I just totally believe the processed garbage we're putting in our bodies it's\nAnd I liked the process is part of me wonders if how old is similar\nTo I'll I Will stick a straw on the Maxwell especially I'm Down [laughter] I I mean are\nWe going to go at a very horrible way you nothing you know brains will be completely eerie at the time we checked out while he\nWas out of these are our bodies would go to toast first in in because the way we we do things now I think we lives live so long that were kind of pressing that envelope for like things like mental stability and\nYou know other type of things as it used to be automatically cancer was a death
