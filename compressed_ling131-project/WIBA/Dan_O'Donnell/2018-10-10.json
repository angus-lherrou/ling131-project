be shots fired because of you and your statements your rhetoric your anger your nastiness\nYour destructive policies\nWhy didn't Henry point that what she believes in what she cares about she won't give any details that's why and if you called gained Connery radical because he wants to crush socialism and wants to crush communism because that's the direction you're in\nAn all you will ... out there trying to be hip and try to be catching up with the new movement or you want to be stupid his most Cortez that's fine but I Need to crush that\nI wasn't when a Democrat points out the price tag of health care for everybody well it's something we have to look at really examined but I'm I'm hateful sexist anti Hispanic or\nA does that a fault I All right fine I'll play the game can\nYou

I just want to say the the leftist don't seem to understand their history a Richard a president Richard Miller house Nixon was elected because of the unrest during Lyndon Johnson I from\nUh because of the war or you know let's not kid ourselves because of a a newly uh our rights given for a for black citizens to be able to vote [laughter]\nNot all of the country was on board right away with that that's right but there's still a tremendous amount of unrest the country not only wanted a sense of justice they wanted this sense\nOf of of peace and prosperity and ... and uh and and and safety air protection and Lyndon Johnson was not providing that Richard Nixon went in now I don't share your trepidation with what's going on now Dan and here's the reason why\nOkay we don't we don't have Lyndon Baines Johnson as president right now we've got Donald Trump the trajectory of the country is\nDemonstrably more positive than the past eight years that we've suffered under Obama\nBut if you if you look at the accomplishments of President Trump or for the last almost two years and again a lot of volatility within the administration but the object is I Believe to a large measure had the net\nUm uh the you know the uh the on the bus build that he signed and the lack of funding for the wall may come back to bite us and and I I you know I don't like the uh the ... that said uh a lot of Americans look at their immediate pocketbook look at the immediate the price of the gas tank\nUm you know getting infected by the state more so than the feds on occasion out around the forty in New York especially\nWhen you're sort of looking at their retirement but really what's going on now is a it's a full outrage it's it's the worst scenario on rafts well he happened to be\nBused in ... and the media is flipping out completely Donald Trump is that calming presence of the nation is in much better shape than it was then back in ... though the late sixties when the unrest is happening and\nThe mayor and though I think has about two years ago I think that that statement applies to I think we're all we are better off than we were two years ago\nOh absolutely oh that's far away and that was that was my point that the director of the country and we're we're going and how far we've come in that two years ah yeah\nYou believe on who you believe wind that I I didn't think existed\nI Know your question my trepidation but do you believe that the fourth estate has had a very aggressive hand and camping down these successes in camping down support of the president and this is what we're fighting this is what I'm concerned about\n... ... ... and it is and that's why they're they're flipping out because there are ...\nThe more ... they've gone more extreme\nTo make the lies and continue these lies to keep people in the dark about but there there's too many folks that that are looking at their paychecks they're looking at their opportunities\nThere looking at their sons and daughters that were were jobless or are working multiple jobs right out of college are now having the opportunity to get the game\nA full time and and yeah and positive employment but I I think the irony here is and this is that bold statement of mind this is why\nI was I was just going to ask you what is that what it is it a prognostications what is the ... state but I've been I've been I've been salivating openings for the entire breaks and Scott lying on\nIts it's the irony that we have a Second Amendment that militia the supposed to protect us from the tyranny of our government the government now with the irony is that we actually I I Want to call Trump's militia because you have\nA citizenry that actually has a militia that may have to protect our government\nRight from the people and from our own bureaucracy\n... and the ... and the founders\nEver saw\nNo no and and the uh the adjusting of how a senator or is it a law elected uh today it is supposed to be the or the house and the legislatures yeah that uh ... it's again we've we've slowly manipulated the process and it's a very frightening to me Scott I'll be honest\nI it's it's disconcerting I I I'm with Rand Paul someone is going to get his fascinated before the\nYeah I'm I'm Sorry to say that but it's going to happen\nAnd it's a Scott I understand your ah your optimism and I but I Do believe we're fighting a fourth state that is so left so a socialist communist on many fronts\nUm that the hordes of graduate today coming out of university and college campuses um these are battalions of left his battalions of socialist in communist\nUm that we have to undo somehow some way and that's it that's another showing up itself Scott re call I appreciate it let's get to my buddy Jeff who's been very very patient Jeff ... you're going to smack me around a little bit but I'm okay with\nThat I you know a light in the day greetings from all riding on the republic the shah readings republic yeah yeah
