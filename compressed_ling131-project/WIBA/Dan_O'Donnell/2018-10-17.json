I Do buy her story but I think she stupid for playing the game I think I think it shows terrible terrible judgment on her part you know it shows\nIt shows real stupid political timing is well this is not here nobody needed that yeah she got on she thought here I get\nIt out of the way and and and she's just she's made matters infinitely worst because I I I I don't I don't and again it goes back to why I don't support or is it shows horrible horrible political judgment is she did not make a good choice on doing that because she she should have seen what's happening to her right now happening because of what we just talked about is there's\nPeople I don't think I'm most the general public doesn't understand\nI have limited understanding as well as a vile this DNA stuff words but I Do know he did\nAt at the end of the day it did prove that she has charity but that doesn't matter that the stories and do you have Cherokee it's how much of it and again that's not an answer to the question that's being asked his is and again that's why I think the Cherokee Nation science out\nThis is that this is insulting what she's doing because it's by the lake or more or less\nYeah by the way that they um [noise] yeah I don't know if you're a young enough to well I'm Sorry I'm old enough to remember this but I'm a song flew into my head soon as I said we started ... ... ... ...\n... yes yes\nYeah yeah well I my kingdom by get to hear that that I [laughter] I doubt you'll wind and put a if you do find it to your awesome All right let's get to the calls\nLet's go to white rich on high one and we also got it on from Janesville who's gonna explain my uh my my poor side of my killed half I get I'm just imagine a rich go right ahead with your call my friend die\nThen it's more work play by liberals she doesn't that turkey dinner at a church as far as the care of it coming that's right that's a liberal voter registration drive the way they're gonna do anything they can do it when it's election [noise]\nAll right so law now again rich you you took a shot at some humor there and I you know I caution people to do that but she was in the Cherokee driving around campaigning for her all\nThe er Paolo ... an old man you know that I Choose not to see this junk\nAnd let me add I I'll say this I I Do believe if they ask you to take a second tested and under or under an ethical or as circumstances in an environment I shall never say yes to that and that's why I don't buy the or the ... the ... the Native Americans rise\nRight at a jury that gr tester and now you're up there you know I mean it's just let it go South American Peruvian right ...\n... ... and by the way it goes through your uh you know your voter registration drive that uh how horrible will be Americans treat these for immigrants they're not immigrants it is a is it a ... it's a parade hidden through South America or that is playing a political game and I I I agree with the first caller today\nOr that there are some um ... money involved with this I wouldn't doubt ... ...

humanity or or the the that lack of worship of the sub culture and that needs to be discussed as worship a sub culture\n\nAnd showing and I just chat and just briefly yesterday as we sent each other's the messages and uh you'll look at the [noise] the state journals coverage of an individual who\nWas solved it a woman and then stole a vehicle it doesn't help in the state journal says in its headline a car thief or a thousand so we'll we'll continue no he's a thug a Salter sub fills\nCultural filth nothing going on at home that's obvious I can answer that question every day\nAnd by the way those of you out there who would judge Judy fans have you noticed she's getting less and less and less tolerant of the ignorance that walks into that TV I a courtroom\nI guarantee you she's a short time a guarantee it I I Can't talk to this level of stupidity anymore I Can't I Can't associate with this to steal\nFrom an avid Sandler movie yeah Adam Sandler movie I I just I Am now dumber for having heard you say would you just said if somebody walks up to me as an adult and says luminal\nSomething's wrong\nBut if I point out the reality of no mom and dad or at least you're more times than I Know that\nSome time somehow some way I'm not being right just said my uh in my analysis was your brain go there you'll be racist yeah stop stop yourself right now save your own save your community don't worry about what I'm saying on the radio\nBut if if there's a shred of humanity and the thug if that person can be a help in any way shape or form I'm a fan of doing that I don't believe every kid's name needs to be on a record\nWhat we now have young ladies or was it a week ago uh for disorderly conduct locked up in the fall it locked up for ... for disorderly conduct let me tell you something Madison police officers don't get to a scene like that looking to lock anybody up\nAll right kids being a moron let's try to show them out a little bit back them off their own stupidity see how that works\n\nBut again if you're asking police to move to a a mediate and moderate situations are okay fine but I Need to be a very direct in my language or there's Pistole culture in your house is it they're not your head yes I Know you don't understand what I just said because you don't know any better\n\nAnd I believe the Madison police department in ... county sheriff's officer a somewhat progressive and I don't think\nThat's a bad thing if you could save a life by God save it if you don't have to put every kid's name on a record don't do it\n\nBut again we've joked about on this air what a what I as a kid thinking I was a tough guy back in the streets of Brooklyn I wasn't so tough just took a a couple of very wise police officer to wake you up to that and the and the media words if you said the mere words to me ah All right fine well up we're going to bring it home and going to let your parents are like ah do just to shoot\nMe now where's my self gimme gimme a prison number I Want my three squares that they do call my dad actually ask\nBut if you're grabbing your crotch and sucking your teeth fit me there's not a lot to communicate with they're the only think there's only one thing that person understands that's more than ... that's a thug in response\nAnd many of the people that I knew it was a kid who thought they were tough guys and bugs took the back of the cops had laid them out yeah I Know that doesn't fly today doesn't work today\nSo I you know we could just resort to if you don't you know if you don't want us you fix it but you can't fix it can you\nKnow regrettably when you when you start to reach misdemeanor and felony offenses you can't negotiate that yeah you have there's got to be a price to pay there's got to be accountability\nAnd again they encounter uses very strong language I understand that\nI Believe and professionalism either again if I'm representing I if I was to be representing a law enforcement agency or a security company or like the great professionals at NPR security in our buddy Sean Smith a who works hand in hand with the Madison police department when it comes to active shooter training and a lot of great stuff\nUh Madison is a great agency and you need to wake up to that great detectives on that job\n\nIf I had the privilege to speak with a couple of retired or a detective good people man really good people\n\nRegrettably when you get a lot of practice should become great detectives and they're getting a lot of practice\n\nWhen she comes out and said listen there needs to be some accountability here juvenile justice nice to have some teeth in it I'm not asking you to ruin your life if you don't have to I I'm speaking for myself now\nUh and cheap coal I I Believe is absolutely correct in saying we need our judges and we need our district attorney to get involved in this\nWe need some accountability we our mayor sock on a talk about the facility the holding facility uh okay I certainly don't want anybody in a in a sales at that ... in ... but there needs to be the er accountability as some fear of the system\nNo I'm not going to do that because this will happen to me if you don't do it you won't get the there needs to be that healthy fear of the system\nDo I appreciate the cops out there today a developing good relationships with young people yes yes I Do\nArgue shock and taken aback when I was in uniform on the streets of Brooklyn New York back in the day I I make people laugh all the time I walked into some of the most insane family disputes in the history of mankind\nAnd within four or five minutes the great a power great and powerful bongo and daddy we would solve this situation we didn't want to beat anybody up we certainly don't want to lock anybody up\nMan you don't want me run in the world if you have five became king of the world who who you know was the toughest bosses I ever had worked the guys who had the most for another job\n\nAnd ... and again my dad was no stranger to find my dad was no stranger to doing the wrong thing\nBut this marine knew it was like I say not as I Do let's go to our has been\nVery patient on line one hour welcome you're on the comedy show thanks you by the way I Apologize to the mayor I should not have said that that was a personal word and it was stupid that I I'm Sorry I'm just getting very frustrated I Apologize to me it's all going right now I should not upset that a ...\n[noise] yeah well you know down the police do what they're told to do but it ministry agreed\nOh they're they're just following orders and if you want to lay back and not do anything to hide like you're starting to do in Chicago that's what they're going to do and jail for the kids should not be a pleasant experience a grade\nIt should be a poor old rule under their bars and and and let them lick it up off the floor everyday kind of a thing [laughter]\nI mean oh joke ... all joking aside out I mean I Believe there needs to be an academic classroom setting and cultural studies need to be a part of that if if you want to go to college in larger advance you know are not had a cultural studies that's fine but American culture studies that needs to be part of ah the punitive or an arrangement I think\nWell I taught for I was I was a schoolteacher and my wife with school and by the time of kittens Thirteen Years old he's either made or he's broken you're not going to take a Thirteen year old and put them in a in a in a seat in the classroom somebody tell them what to do\nI buy the al I disagree completely I Believe you can save it sixteen Seventeen Eighteen year old I really do believe you could say that they were broken I'll admit that\nAh but again when you when you take um the approach of a a ... and again my dad had to write because again Dan was no stranger to fun and I made it my mission because to be a\nOf the insane insane about atmosphere that I grew up and I I just read you know rallied against it I railed against it all the time and the fact is at the end of the day you know I did eventually penetrate my skill that you know what I'm doing the wrong thing here
