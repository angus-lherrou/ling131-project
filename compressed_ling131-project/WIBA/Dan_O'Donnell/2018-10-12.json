anything they can do to have a uh uh the Dodgers beat the brewers\nAnd you kind of prognosticators that earlier in the week shot\nUm it was very interesting how biased or a you know leaks can be against certain teams and I actually believe it or you know I I I'm not a big a conspiracy guy here but the fact is I buy that I there there is a\nUm I've noticed when you do show in New York and yet a couple of times you talk with people there is just as an abject dismissive this even over the twin cities market which is number Fifteen market in the country um\nYou know even back then it was a guy you know we'll do we really want the twins do well you know rise to the top yes yes you do\nA that'll show the rest of the country that you know anybody can make it to the you know to the show um I and I I got to have you always felt this way ... it's just something that an anomaly over the last couple of I I think that's probably been around for a long time\nYeah oh gosh it's it has been but one of the things that was funny because I'm One of the Chicago Cubs players kinda ridiculed the brewers about you know it's not a rivalry basically um can a complaint talking about\nYou know that the brewers are relatively insignificant now than it is true the Milwaukee Brewers it is the smallest market for a baseball organization yet they have\nThe tenth highest in all of major league baseball ticket sales is when it comes to average attendance the brewers are right up there with the New York's with the Chicago's we LA's\nUm they are they are a huge draw for fan base they've got a a pretty significant one so I\nYou know it's in ... who knows how to play out people like the underdog story and I think the brewers can can safely play that role of listen we're just this you know this this small little club from the small little city people like that kind of story line so\nI think the major league baseball might be wrong and wanting the LA Dodgers there's a lot more going on with LA than than just baseball Wisconsin right now as much we love the badgers much we love the Packers I think everybody's locked in on these brewers and really young seemed\nVery big deal yeah um I can tell you that you just said hit the nail on the head I was watching some of that\nCoverage of the Yankee laws are back in the ... no no a lot of like a real baseball fans who say that's okay you know get a lot of teams we move on now that we've got some stuff to do here in midtown that's in well our future they'll get over it was a great uh [laughter] and ah and we can pick on may\n... why don't

the borough of beating people [laughter] and they they didn't have the the ... to stay in the ... ...\nWhat did you get the town with his stick just for walking down the wrong\nAnd it's coming back by the way um\nUh yeah the Dodgers if you know my dad and his brothers where young men when the Dodgers left uh Brooklyn New York\nAnd if you say the name O'Malley to them even the dead ones have you
