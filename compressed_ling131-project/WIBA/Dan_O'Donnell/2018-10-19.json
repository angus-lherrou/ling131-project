for the last forty minutes that I've been on\nA you're telling me I should have just called a few minutes ago and I would have been on the list of damn I get in she was working the system the wrong way\nBut it's to me it's hey listen first come first served a again if you're talking about a very good restaurant of which there are many in the Madison area a reservations obviously that that is appropriate but the the call and system a lot of people didn't know how to work that\nYou know they were calling I'm Sorry that's a call and you know we promise we get them at first that they call

she's like yeah you're you're getting a little upset over something that you shouldn't get upset and this is wrong this is still open I've worked enough counters in my day and I said I've served enough people in my day and I guess what I had to manage the reservation list as well you don't do that the caller had\nBut they were doing the call I had the wrong way you got to take the time for the call and uh if they're not there within a certain amount of time you can't put them in front of people waiting there for forty minutes which they did you're an American I wrote in you thank you and again I I there's a ... a good way during the good waitress they have a paste advocate um\nAnd one day on with my friends bill Snyder is a copper and he was a very great supporter of my way I consider him a brother and what what was he and his now wife is sitting there and I'm like I Would I Would flip out because\nI asked a I got a stake in front of me dude I said you don't want to I Would like someone that special hot sauce yeah great no problems ... and they get a lot of what what do you call a flash on the ...\nUh what do they call it ... I hear I don't know what the hell it is but it's flashes and I just think you know hey great that's great yeah great evidence great great great great and I'm like yeah I Need the ...\nThe guy walked over to another table and takes the drinker and I'm like okay take the drink water I get that but then he comes back with the drinks to that tape\nI'm like excuse me I got a hot steaming stake in front of me and I asked a special sauce they can wait another minute for their drinks you gotta you gotta know what you're doing oh that's Great Hey no problem no yes it is a problem and my friends like Daniel you do have an anger management told\nIt's a dude if you walk into a restaurant I'll give it to a Jewish deli where I work as a kid\nUh when you have the academics and you're happy at the communist get together in the oval office like you did with the Obama administration a guess what do they will do it exactly what they said that we're going to do put their foot on the neck of business which is what they did\nEspecially the energy industry no doubt about it they they want it to what they wanted that to quote unquote die on the vine and we've all on my side is used that phrase is while I Believe new that um\nI can tell you right now that if the Democrats get the house back look at that market go it's going to plummet it's going to plummet big time and it's going to stay down they taught\nBusiness is not going to like losing the house of representatives now business has been playing both sides of the coin though it was well alright them across the quite near power let's give them a hundred million dollars\nSo again you know they're guilty of of their own behavior as well\nBut the fact is I predict and I say with absolute total confidence if the Democrats get the house back it will be a downturn in the economy and it's not just going to be for a week it's going to be for a while\nBecause we're not going to lose the Senate they're Republicans will not lose the Senate will obviously not lose the White House in Nineteen days and we're going to be paralyzed and the market is not going to like that\nUm so that's my prediction\nGo to a wide my buddy jumping up and down a republic ... who's been standing by for hours or Jeff thank you so much for your time today take your time take all the time you need I appreciate about go right ahead\n[laughter] yeah I uh sometimes gridlock can be good and we All right\nOut of the problems we had were the regulations that obviously Mr Trump is got his hand on the on the throttle for that\nJob and I think it will change their the tax law is good for businesses is now the tax law and nothing's going to change so I yeah if things might slow down but again keep your eye on corporate burning ... that's that's the key world events\nI Know it had a nice drop yesterday because of the shape of a of a Saudi Arabia right and how we're going to respond and obviously the trepidation over the election coming up so\nI I I I think we are going to continue or maybe the slower rate but uh I'll take the ten percent a year I I don't have a problem with that\nAll right um so you predict until the election will have some volatility will will have a roller coaster until then and I agree with that um\nYeah because we're like Ben turkey on our our one of the causes I Know the Chinese market yesterday as well but we never ... buys me my clients who smoked locally\nYou know there are you you bought you make a profit wouldn't buy now when you sell so by low sell highest you'll rule of the day a diversify a little bit looked at some of the international stocks that are down a yeah this last forever every dog has its day\nListen the Asian market when it's down you know for you know for sure that's going to head back up yoga the nineties and the two thousands or the Asian market was and I spent a ... a a special and was not Chinese young age\nThat they ah the ah ... ah ah hangs behind the is it\nYeah yeah and the Shanghai I mean I think they doubled any here they are they just goes back\nAll got five six seven eight years ago but you you're also keep in mind we've got this trade negotiations going on with China Ryan who is who is more to lose by holding out and what the market in China the the population beginning to get concern\nUm and I think\nThey're just they're flirting with a recession numbers are potentially hook it even worse than that\nSo yeah so ... I don't uh don't question that at some point I think the Chinese are going to come back to like the Canadians like the the uh Mexico yeah\nHey Mr President we maybe we really do need to talk\nI just I'm is I I maybe I was I'm remiss in not factoring in some of the uh foreign policies some of the border policy and and now the other economic realities are that we are the Democrats if in power will have they'll have the power to power lies they will have that power\nYeah gridlock again gridlock is not necessarily bad or they can't\n... our government cannot ... more a a a regulations and a stupid rules on us if they're in gridlock\nAll right you have a good termination story for us to hear that because you're dead on owned or\n...

Kmart used to be Indiana just and it's a beautiful beautiful facility the I'll tell you this not to do a plug for festival foods but if you are a parent with the with the ... and uh you don't like them nagging you while you're grocery shop they've got a daycare in that place so and it's free you while you shop\nOh cool is that even thinking about the cold and so that are going to walk in this building but there's a little pen for you to play andme over\nThere so early in the ... demands like the heat it's it's a very effective thing because when we go Manson loves doing it because there's like crafts and their stuff for him to do so it's a it's a win win for the ... man I'll tell you awesome yeah\nI went to pick up George then we'll take on X ray guy George on line three um I I I was shown and I both know the show for a while but have added Georgia appreciating what\nDan my bike yeah but the reason why you might call sort of evolved from one I originally got untold Sean too now after listening to talk to these veterans a ... I have a question about that can we us regular radio listeners come down there and meet is this an outing\nA Minnesota member of my ... my beloved who I Love and look up to the FBI so a welcome Peter\nThat I guess I'm calling for my wife because you know she was quite a bit with me on the radio and ... and she's been taken out middling FBI agents who are out in the field group and\nYou know yesterday was just a case in point where a gap in Minnesota which just the agent that sense of four and a half years in prison for his deal with a man he was digging and Manafort's business and then he leaked it to the crash that some of the charges that came up against Manafort was because of the stuff that he\nIllegally dug into but he leaked to the crash and then they ended up you know\nI I did not see a sentencing on I didn't say where we're happier\nYesterday and the and the eight or ... years old and and me and he's got two young kids and you know he thought he they doubted it or try to get on probation but ended up at four and a half years and\nIt's just that you know my wife is worried complain about this and she hears about you're talking about all the guys in the street and there are there better Mac and she's been quite now Jimmy greatly it seems like even the ... FBI agents are getting themselves into trouble for for leaking stop\nFor a fact I'm looking at going on and I don't know I'm I'm Down to wait on our\nHeat All right yeah yeah I I I'm looking at the story right now and uh began to check in the ... you're right you got for years and uh\nAnd Terry Jay all very arrived in Minneapolis and twenty twelve about eleven years after you went to work for the FBI he had grown increasingly convinced that the agents were abusing their powers and discriminate against racial and religious minorities or this is a guy who showed up with a mission this is a very very different guy\nUm and when I talk about the guy in the mission I talk about the person who's there to score some money I wasn't able to get on the NYPD or or a big agency or the FBI they were there to score some money down the road the professional victim\nUm and this is the case of the uh the socially promoted and the a and a a again you look at promotions if if you're standing there and you think you're a boss and they're not talking about if you leave the room yes they are [noise] did you pass the test no you didn't\nUm this is a case of the lowest standard rising to the top uh soon as I as soon as they thought it was like okay got it and I know the story immediately\nUm [noise] and uh so in other words to Pete I was uh\nI was told somebody it might have to just see you were a member of the FBI the ... yeah I knew what you've been a huge meal is talking about the very high standards of the FBI what I Will say is that every federal agency says it had been subject to lowered standards\nEvery federal agency and and uh and uh a hiring public agency whether it's a uh uh the city police department county sheriff or state agencies everybody's got to play by the rules now\nAnd you get certain people shoved down your front and say oh you got to take them I went on the job with a woman who was a real woman in robberies\nOr as you get on the NYPD and she was kind of this threatening I'm going to see you there'll be racist there'll be raised system but it's still you see I'm the only people person on the air we could talk about stuff like this um and they know I'm telling the truth they know I live that they know I was there they don't like me because I went to\nThe same school for at the same books had the same teachers yet\nI had to pass the test was\nAnd um again I I I create a very uncomfortable environment for a lot of people would I get it to issues like this uh this is reality that they were stuck with\nAnd that when your show up on a mission and again you know where we want to not phrase from from the black detectors and bosses that I worked with through by the way or the people that I ... did not take the promotion on the lower grade on the failing grade they did not take it\nAnd when they did pass and again I tell a story all the time on this air one of the best bosses ever had on the job a black gentleman and the first thing he felt he had to tell the roll call was I passed the test by the white just wanted to get that out of the way\nA which is an unfair position for him to have to be he felt like he had a justifies a existence in front of the uh the troops and it was a true leader of Venus the cops cop and a and the men and women who worked for this guy I Love the\nUh it is what it is a you know this balkanization of the United states this professional victim mentality it's going to get used is going to get bused\nMy mother was on the forefront of hiring a a ... the ladies that you like to call them uh she brought in black and Hispanic employees into the operations division of a Wall Street firm unheard of back in the Nineteen seventies unheard up\nAnd she was she ... she fought for them she fought for doing the right thing and I would say my mother was a civil rights activists without being a member of any organization she watch\nIf you said that racist filthy terms in our household guess what you know you made a mistake immediately because the stars in the pain in your head in front of your eyes yeah you're you're really is yeah I did something stupid just at\nCertain words were foot boat in our house and if you set them you got you got you learned about quickly\n\nSo you know again when I talk about the uh the FBI being the best of the best I still stand by that uh the da and the ATF a great agents out there a federal Marshalls good people\nAlways perfect no or do we make mistakes yes uh but uh again when people you got people showing up on a mission it comes back to bite you and yes sorry for my terminology that but you know I I Am who I Am\nThree two one Thirteen ten three two one Thirteen ... do I still say the FBI is the best of the game yes I Do a or are they a cut above yes they are tell you why because they take the best from us\nA sheriff's officers and police departments across the country they take experienced a and a obviously academically qualified individuals ah it's a big deal I think that counts for something by the way\nCould I meet the standards to get on the FBI absolutely not\nBut the fact is I'm not afraid to acknowledge them as being the best the agency and on on the planet for investigations into and just great agents who I learned from who I was taught by instructed by and I got to go through a lot of great training with\nAnd I was fortunate to have done that we got to take a break thirty six past the hour this is the kind of ratio and it was talked thirteenth ...
