I Believe uh\nYou know as much as a uh Craig took criticism during the year he made decisions that turned out to be pretty correct I'm ... now I have people talking about his demise in his dismissal was the coach that's ridiculous he took his team to the un out see us\nAnd it's a it is what it is I and I just to that you know thank you thank you Milwaukee Brewers that's that's what I feel like I should be saying today shock people I feel good about myself so human being and a and a lot of great fun bunch of guys too I you know and nobody struck me as a PRP which I like\nThat's not asking a lot I Know but but I Need the counseling now needs a hug every now and then\nIt go ahead please no\nI'll I'll root for the red Sox in in like you point out it's man that it would have been so nice to have the little team that could the nice thing about the little team that good as they can is is this is the ... they they got there probably you're too early and I think they're probably ahead of the curve as far as what prognosticators will tell you where they should be\nWe've got a good team for for a few more years so this is I think for a lot of us just the beginning so\nState ... lower ... Jeff Miller a my producer was in the locker room or ... them from the Milwaukee show it was in the locker room after the game and ... and he said he knows when he gets the false positives he gets the fake you know All right you know well we're up about this or\nThey really believe hey listen where what is next two years we're back to this level we believe that we will be back\nAnd now there's a reason uh to have an energy and ah and it just you know we we should have won this guy and we're going to be back when I Would not given up a we can't wait to start next season that was the attitude ... a felt that was real he was very happy with the the attitude 'cause he was very down you know when he went into the locker room and just but he was completely\nI'm blown away by the positive atmosphere and how good these guys were in that locker room I'm just it just so you know I Love you and I love your wall and I love the boroughs and uh we need to talk about the upside and it's a ... we've got um let's see here we got a brick\nAnd bill let's go to Britain right now has been very very patient ... how you doing you're on the day encounters you appreciate your time credit for the call\nGood morning Matt um wait a minute wait a minute what level where do you get Matt from\nWell I'm Sorry I was thinking of Sean for a second I was also a Mac it'll get down there I'm Sorry Dana\nYeah nice to meet you dad Connery nice to meet you kind of rush chairman plus chairman\nAt I had a brain issue this morning [laughter] a related question is why isn't court they're getting on a community funded plane going\nAnd going to be a the caravan caravan down there and directing all those people don't go to Venezuela's socialist was so great\nAbout its um and bread I Wish you great luck with your brain issues today I have them as well have a great day appreciate your time\nUm I Do believe there is a president's down there I Do believe there was an American presidents down there I Do believe there was a George Soros presence that the president's down there I Do believe there's a lot of ... attorneys down there from the the us\nI I Believe this is a very very nefarious movement it's an evil movement um let's go to bill before you have to break your ... I hate to Russia go right ahead with your call who hit the top of the hour\nMore and more to do you do it I'll make it quick a war and I just want to say I'm surprised that\nThe the lack of coverage that come in a mate in ... uh that's driving me nuts somewhere near a lot of really that but they could do the other thing is is that I'm just the world series is ... ... I'm not gonna watch it because you've got two big league teams play too big ... big city and\nSo it's really not interesting to me and the other part of it is as we all know just like actors when they made her Super Bowl with Aaron and stuff like that\nAnd you're gone even with far we know they're coming back next year they're going to do it they're one Andrew away from the making the playoffs you know what I mean it happened yeah yeah that's why it's so the spoiler so disappointing me\nBecause it's like a gene a bottle you mean you're you're that close and it might be we make because I never listen to the brewer games in eighty two you know what I mean there were so electric and magic when they're with the world series\nYou know and we're so close but you know I I Hope that that the team as resilient and everything else and make it at least another shot and\nI I agree with you on the table I ... I I agree with you on people I think they're about a season ahead of themselves as far as where they should be at a so that's a positive to me that I I think they will be back postseason next year no doubt about it\nAnd a bill I appreciate it we got to take a break a already the show's flying by I blame Sean ... [laughter] and uh this is the comedy show new stock Thirteen Gen WNBA\nOutcome or twenty second what's new today on the free I our radio at high check out our entire radio resent inside the studio during a brand new episode with the legendary Paul McCartney now I'm In ... to\nNominate down with Joe leaving the talking about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about a little band called the feed off we were fees when we were playing music or radio present inside the city yeah check it out now\nI'm not a fan okay you know and in other words at a ... a shielded duck comment there they can say well you know I listen to our policies I don't like it that was a shot that was a shot and I think it was a a a a sexist shot quite frankly\nAnd yeah yeah I'm not going to accept well just women being women you know yeah yeah I don't go for that you want to play the game will play the game what's in it for the Democrats what's in it for the Democrats win the caravan shows up around election day let's say or or just prior\nWill they be filming the hungry and starving children who are losing their lives and they're getting no help from the United states we are treating them horribly because where the United states and preemptively every opinion coming out of talking\nOr American media America's going to say that we America did something wrong here\nAnd I find that thought process incredible\nBut again it's a political game this caravan is politics this caravan is the Democrat a Communist Party this car vantage George Soros somebody explained to me where the dozens of trucks that started showing up at food drink and water\nAnd uh the buses that are now showing up slowly but surely I didn't see it you know I didn't see a caravan of buses but they're not showing up picking people up\nWhere do we go wrong here and when\nDid the country again you got to give credit to block Obama fundamentally transform of the United states of America we now have battalions of left is walking out of our our American universities and colleges battalions of them we have legal students law students\nWalking out and protest over ... over a cabinet obviously they're not being ... taught about evidence furry rules they're not being taught anything about mere suspicion reasonable suspicion of probable cause\nLaw students getting up and and commanded by definition today if you graduate in American law school by definition you're supposed to be left of center when did that happen\nI'm looking for both sides and Rob if you can dial back in\nA I'm going to pick you up right away here I'm Sorry about that let's go to rich on line to has been very very patient or Rob again my apologies I'm I'm just getting kinda crazy over that says you are rich thanks for your time today go right ahead my front thanks\nNot exactly what's going on it originally George Soros transferred all of it to change something happening in order for it I\nWant to be part of it and in cash straight about doing it out\nThere and we already have video of lines of people being handed a currency no doubt about it yeah I've seen the video\nOr carrying a you know a lot of our aren't really that through their come ...\nAgain I guarantee you the closer to get to the border and this is how the various it is those people carrying those flags from their respective countries will be told puts them away now we're getting close to America that it just it in other words you're carrying your flag to my country and enrich there's something to be said about what you just mentioned there's something to be said about that\nAnd when the president says that he's going to utilize the military not the national guard he's going to utilize the military everyone's oh why are we doing this what if we got the same amount of ... what have we got ten thousand Americans to greet them at the border and say hey what's going on\nAnd you had CBS the other night rich or even all of this one CBS nightly news I think it was last Thursday or friday\nOr the president is going to be closing the border to migrant families that was their teams for the six thirty seven thirty broadcast that was their teeth\nOr it's it's I mean this is bizarre and it's dangerous and what the Democrats want to do to the United states is just mind boggling to me and again you got your\nYou got the college level a student just jumping up and down and just stimulate oh oh God what a great moment no it's not more on this is not going to work out but has anybody told you about Venezuela yet or we don't want to\nGo after that that the lower the people you're bringing lower wage jak people you know I I keep hearing how they're doing this or doing that sure on multiple social ... no longer prosecute\nPeople for using multiple social if you don't keep it it's it's one big can't they're running a business they're keeping wages will buy it for more people well we have plenty of jobs\nAnd if you do bring in horrible low skilled laborers you have to pay more you break all all ... up\nWith the idea that they get emotional if Bush to women and children to the front of women that\nYou can get into motion it is it is the heart and obviously the dumb down brain that they're speaking to and it's also a very very culpable co conspirator American a journalism and media today they owe the fourth estate and they and they sit\nThere and they talk to themselves but we're just we're just reasonable this is just the right thing does right what do you think actually no it's not\nUm and again I don't how was I don't know how are you think this way I I don't know how you um your process information this way just as bad my brother called this era I mean my brother was a a loyal um\nHe's you know a ... how would you describe my brother was he like I I guess he's used kind of a man with other countries on the sidelines now he doesn't he's not crazy about either party anymore\nI I Would call them a traditionalist he's like he's kind of like being in in a traditionalist there can be conservative traditionalist and liberal\nYeah analyst yeah you're right yeah that's a good that's a good word thank you I appreciate that I'm three two one Thirteen ten three two one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five thirteenth we'll get to pick up Rob right now Hey Rob sorry about that before go right ahead with your call take take your time ...\nHey thanks that I appreciate the invite back\nThank you [laughter] you're always welcome on that and ... you know that I'm a forgiving man [laughter]\nYou know the caravan making everybody nervous I think it's making Democrats nervous I think making Republicans nervous you know I liked the idea of calling it an invasion or rather a caravan um\nYeah I just I Do see a rich had a great point icy flags from uh read their respective countries that's not a good start as far as I'm concerned and right\nAnd and if we start thinking about this is somewhat of an act of terrorism a very we can kind of look past the women and children in front of the TV cameras because\nTerrorists use women and children as human shields and their parents are involving into what our parade of is you know along with the military and National Guard or whatever else you know what if we have thousands of Americans to meet them at the border\nTo go on trade with Robin ... over and badly for every Rob\nI and I I again I think about and let me ask you the question you're nervous about it and I said to myself why would a ten thousand Americans going down to the border to say you know what were closed\nAnd up again ... you're picking up where when we're going here um how will they be described by the American media on one side of the border these victims these are these are migrants these are innocent people who are being treated horribly by Donald ... at the\nPercentage of them go where I Believe our our job and they're wanting to escape terrible\nOh I'd read that I agree I agree with you or whatever I\nDo believe that uh again if if people are are are\nStill a gym and and protecting our own borders as if this were a terrorist invasion if it was some type of uh [laughter] they're just they're just in Beijing I don't think it would ever be reported that way [noise]\nUm would it be a mistake for politicians to start calling at ... invasion which some people have tried to kick that off are just take it really funny a word I well I think\nIt would show some significant backbone on the part of our politicians would take some significant guts for them to do it and I also think it would be the right thing to do whether or not they are able to do it is quite another matter\nSo Rob I'm a I'm a ... I guess I'm a shallow vapid political animal because I Am worried about the words that we can I I'm literally worried about the words were going to use their\nShame on me and a\nA robbery she had to call today pal great coal thanks for calling back we got to take a break it said Nineteen past the hour three two one Thirteen tend three two one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten am I being too political about this and do we just do the right thing I'm Rob made some good points there along with rich\nUm do we have the character and and the or the some Democrats nervous about this as well I think that's a great point a preacher one Thirteen tents all free age seven seven to three five Thirteen ten that is the one and only showing people I'm Dan Connery this is news talk Thirteen ten WNBA we shall return [noise]\nUm again I was on the line at the DMV and Sacramento, California a couple of years ago or getting my license\nAnd and you know the ... bubble gum or documentation that they were just being handed the identification and licenses it was it was surreal to me it was bizarre and we now have\nCalifornia admitted uh yeah we might have given out\nLicenses to like twelve hundred people or by mistake it wasn't by mistake or California you know it and I know it um\nIt's it's frightening it really is frightening what did they want what what do they want to do to our country what do they want to do to our culture why don't say culture Dan\nBecause you'll have the likes of Cortez and other race ... out there who will come up and say I'm really racist yeah I'm Talking about American culture here's the American culture you arrive here\nAnd again I'll look a lot of people and their families in their history didn't arrive here voluntarily I see that point every time I talk about this the Native American didn't get the volunteer or the American Indian uh went through something that is again a shameful shameful a point in our history\nBlack folks didn't historically did that come here voluntarily\nUh and that that resentment that anger and that that little twinge in the back of a ... of folks brains who feel that I Can't protect sitting here and pretend I Know what that's like ... and I'm not going to\nBut at some point you've got a ... and accept and understand what the American culture is we come together or we are an incredible melting pot we've taken\nReligion every creed every color and every country and we've taken him in the United states and we turned them into what what my family called the ugly American the yanks\nAnd our rights I Want you to grow up being ... if you'd be the I could behave like the Yankees have a good time\nAnd you get older and ... and uh my mom growing up when they started to get their little ... a ... and eventually when they got out of the orphanage and they were adopted by there and Bridgette Bridgette for the call it the ...\nAnd Bridget Gallagher told all the describes in the family you don't speak the Irish you speak to yank because they all had a little broke so they can't that you know and by God to the ... here's what they were they went wrong with that and you're ready for here's where the mix Sherry's went wrong they went from the Irish broke two\nOh my God I Can't believe what's going on in the city and they went from the way to bring back to broke [laughter] ... ... what did you what do you do to make\nAt the oh my God fifty on the climate will go back and forth\nAnd a and again I'll wrap this half hour up by just saying I it's the melting pot when you are a jump into the melting pot you adopt and you would hear and you cooperate and again I I look at New York city is one of the greatest petri dishes on the face of the planet\nI'm you know your your brag about other countries and I I guess London is the best example ... and ... certainly a diversity\nUh Madison certainly diversity and again but you come together and you will brace and you understand the joy knowledge what the American culture is enjoy your heritage enjoy your history I'm I'm for that um I Want my killed that played in the pipe and I I went to the pub off and lost [laughter]\nAnd ah they enjoyed it\nA good day session good Kelly is it that is\n[noise] here's your here's your word for today Sean people are acutely and to party just as good as you can have a great time like that\nBut if if my mother ever called you an arm of Don yeah that's a bad word do know that don't let the Irish ... now and by the way last a cultural point and my brother John ... back me up on this\nUm if the Irish refer to you as a week they mean short they made them your they mean small and but if the Scott's cool you we showing\nAll the talking about ... a lot of talking about you as a human being and the oh he's a we might go away I'll ...

Peter what do you say to a guy like me who I Do in fact I disagree with your analysis I disagree with the fact that there are there\nThere needs to be I Believe a strong response to this and it can be a strong response and guess what if we close the border we won't have to worry about the invaders every close the border\nAnd we get serious about border security we won't it again the the president is allowed to close the border officially taking no immigrants he can shut that down immediately we\nYeah we can do that okay right after require a military incredible progress murdered people and you know and it's not going to mean pretty\nWell I I I Do agree that I mean I Do agree they will try it I don't agree they will they will try to come in and I do agree with that Peter and I\nI don't mind somebody getting fired up I don't mind somebody being passionate about an issue\nUh but I also believe that we are one of the most benevolent you main countries on the planet every piece of land we have liberated for the last uh two hundred years or whether it was a a a a a an act of a of a police action if you will or a a A R that absolute war\nYou know what the United States has done with that land we've given back\nAnd we are not an empire we are not somebody again we we fought a war with Mexico after we beat them we paid for the property people forget that after the Mexican American War after we beat them we beat them solidly and are you going to the Ivory Coast going to go back to that conflict ...\nListen to the marine corps him\nOh once again we gave it back um I I I Would I Would suggest that ah ah\nWhat's the Cuban island we have ... we have are getting ... ... a ... you know if if we we you know we keep that there was a a lengthy ah agreement signed for them for that piece of property I by the white never give that up I I Would say never give that up never ... never surrender\nI I Do believe we can manage this and I do believe we can shut that border doubt\nOr is it if it takes a physical presence from members of the military for a short time I agree but this is a moment in time where we can say to our democratic friends we wouldn't have this problem with it if we had a fence now would wait\nAnd the president by the way can shut down the legal entry into the United states he can shut that down for a while or let's go to Scott has been very very patient Hey Scott how are you doing path appreciate your time\nPretty good it's a hot topic I'd say it's it is top top two top three or four nation in fact this is a Seventy or eighty percent issue for Republicans don't even really need a spine politically uh and and your your uh illusion to us\nA general Sam Houston actually went all the way down to Mexico City\nUh we don't keep them we gave it back right we paid for what we wanted and gave the rest back which is the ... take a look on the map the were Mexico City is\nIt's quite a ways so that we gave a lot of land back so to those Rican kids to uh my middle fingers extended right now but what I wanted to say is this is a free in the military down here\nThat that isn't necessary if nothing else to process the invaders but what the Dems are doing let's distilled us for what it is this is all optics\nThey're going to write and as the look bad no matter what if it works so well in the military is down there they'll get pictures and the and the media will support of fascist regime look what look like Trump's using soldiers to pride\nAnd again Scott I hate to cut you off but the ah you you just hit the nail on the fourth estate will sell that story the way the left wants to sell that story\nA and that's that's the reality and and listening in the twin cities that Scott and I said you know weapons are probably not a good idea but I suggest video cameras and up that they live stream the stuff that the mainstream media will not want us to say\nUm I think that's a great idea um but the process and to be a humane and obviously I again I say you mean I don't get mad at me for that I Know I got yelled that for a uh the last time that these people use their children and to come up to the border and then again the Democrats and the media sold it for what it you know what was it was not\nAnd we got to feed people we we we got to take care of people we got to make sure they don't die in our custody that says that's an important thing and Scott I um\nI understand we can get the the word just still is absolutely correct to break it down for what it really is and it's a game of optics and once again a grateful call by Scott got to take a break I'm fifty eight past the hour that is the one and only showing people this is the day and kind of ratio news talk Thirteen ten WNBA we shall return

... the great city of Madison I shouldnt review that shit I but I Do\nHave a priest is you know about that moonshine history I really credible stuff\nYou need to tell me a bunch of undocumented immigrants came to this country to break\nThe law [laughter] tell me about it [laughter]\nHow do we know they were documented they couldn't fill out forms back then come on [laughter] little or no documentation of Lebanon against their undocumented\nAnd by the way tactically the Congress did come here illegally by the way I should I should point that out\nSo did the prequels do no wonder why we like each other so much\nYou go yeah in fact I was there was a little bit of what they used to cold jumping ship back in the data of ever heard that phrase um and they jumped ship or\nOr just before the civil war and again and again somewhat down to Franklin, Tennessee\nAs somewhat to the great city of New York after they got to you know that's how you know the economy's ... half of them at least half of a lazy that that is nice I think I'll stay here [laughter] you can also about hey not too bad not too shabby along at a you know oh what do you mean the mid west now you got the Germans and no reason that that I work too hard those people like I Want to part of that\nAnd again you know you talk about that just the building of the White House in this country and history how people don't know history I bet you my buddy John from Janesville knows this\nThat every time they say the White House was built by slaves and nobody else yeah actually that the guys working on we are getting paid a not a great salary I'm not saying they were treated like gold but there's a lot of what do you call a Scottish stone masons working on the White House\nAnd we keep rewriting history he rewriting uh what is fact and what is truth\nI Know the country has had a very very racist background but I say honestly for the last ... you know Seventy eighty years the country's been trying to address this especially the last fifty years\nThe communist element within the Democratic party picked up on something in the Nineteen sixties they picked up on the fact that they could they jump on the ah you know the shirt tales of ah what was it\nCivil rights movement and by God they did a great job look at our education system today why is it when I watched the men on the street interviews\nAnd I can you tell me who we fought in World War two yeah it was like a Chinese or something like a Dr Ford answered the question place who was the axis [laughter] the axis\nWill or two I think it was like Egypt or Sunday at yeah okay that's just out by I think I might have been killed but I ran out of the house and didn't talk to anybody that I don't know where I was I don't remember the house ...\nSomebody killed me down to preach because we were your way if you love me a whack the next time [laughter] [laughter]\nIs it I'm just I'm starting to get frustrated princess what I'm ... I'm a rewrite history um they they read the ... the history books now you have a a ... you have a history you have a text books in the schools today that are saying and what ever happened like it was a Democrat not now when he was it\nAnd it's just like sit says oh great what a great curriculum\nToday class we will do the social justice and Donald Trump within assaults upon the United states of America yet that's how we're going to teach that and that's really really bad so\nI'm going home ... I've had enough in his he let me\nGo [laughter] let me ask you do you think that previous waves of immigrants were also were were those invasions [noise] and I guess how does that change now because I keep hearing that word and and and I asked\nMajority of immigrant let's say in the early Nineteen hundreds were documented they it was from Europe it was a movement that was a a ... by any measure by any metric there certainly was some accountability upon arrival\nAnd Alice island for all its flaws for all it's a very very uh the heart wrenching stories on that island and ... you know people being turned away and put right back on a boat that day\nOr you're you're in a solitary confinement medically or you know waiting for the past I I get that I and I I'm ... but but you talk about again this was a very racist piece of legislation a that was a a after the or the Chinese built the railroads along with the Irish\nOr there was legislation I Believe I pick out what year was ... where they\nThey said All right that sit on Chinese migration ... and they actually created a lot no Chinese migrants sorry can't help you out of there are moments of racism and moments of a of of looking at a immigrants as invasions and and they were\nConsidered invaders after they got used 'em by you know the corporate America in it for lack of about a description here um we we ... we certainly have bruises on our history perhaps\nI Am with you on it but again okay my my thinking though is like historically we didn't send the navy out to turn these people are on\nI ... I Am I Am what I'm saying is\nWe these people haven't even come to the United states yet to to make their case is we don't give them an opportunity we say older coming through Mexico this invasion all they want to come to the United states it's an invasion\nWhat ever happened to processing them and actually having adequate visas for\nThose who fit these definitions we will allow these people when I hear all about is why I'm all for legal immigration I'm all for legal immigration which were all for all for the legal process why do we keep making it harder and harder and harder and harder for people to come here legally were basically encouraging people to it\nBut it during the ... it's not once they cross that border praised it's not like we put them on a rocket launcher and then send them back over the fence we let them and we get them I'll I'll use the description I used that well if we had a misdemeanor offensive was non violent\nI'm back on the NYPD and by the way my condolences to my brother and sister MOS out there who now wearing body camps that are going up in flames um\nWe used to get what's called the desk appearance ticket and it's it's a federal uh uh a citation for you to appear at a hearing down the road how many people appear at that hearing crepes yeah statistically not a whole hell of a whole lot um\nAnd and again we re processes and we deal with them\nA lot of people feel it you know catch and release it some you know it's a real thing it's a real reality DACA was something invented by Iraq Obama everybody's talking about all I can see all the historical law DACA know DACA bad um and again I I just wish people would show up give me some documentation at the border you give it a whirl give it a shot\nMuch statistically you probably won't be allowed in but you can't working on it um and ... the caravan to me ... ... is a political move and I'm not a human not a human tragedy moment it's a political move made and that that's what I have\n... is in and it's why and and I know you know you took issue with kind of the the the phrasing of it at the top of the hour during the news is that to me it's it why does it explode why does expand because it got the attention of the president of the United states it is a political movement it it is it it started out small and it grows because it gets attention all I'm saying is is to me is\nWe've got it we we are and\nI I Know why we do this because it's cheap labor but we we keep reinforcing the system that encourages people to skip the lines that encourages people to go around those lines\nBecause we won't let them in this country otherwise there's no way if you are a labor are living in Mexico or Guatemala there is no way in your lifetime and maybe even your child lifetime you may be sooner gets Packer season tickets than get into this country legally we do that on purpose why because when they get here\nWe can exploit them we can do these we can make them work for next to nothing we don't have to provide them benefits and say tough that's that's the American experience you want that opportunity you're going to do things this way and to me at some point we've gotta step back and say what do we deal with these ... with ... they used as the prime example\nWhen these people reached the border how do we handle them do we point guns in the military and them or do we say let's bring you in process you if you have a legitimate\nOr a claim to come to this country if you if you're seeking refuge says those type of things we will let you in if you don't we are going to put you on a bus and we're going to drive you back down from once you came why can't we have that conversation is that why can't we encourage the presidents and other lawmakers say let's let's have a reasonable reaction to these people coming to the borders\nGoing to take you up and your suggestion maybe you need to send the military down there\nAnd um we had a few people a chuckle at the moment when I asked about the Cuban island\n... yes [laughter] yes\nThey get the get ... yeah what's that Cuban island on the island and I yeah yeah it ... that come on one thing I had brain surgery it'd be nice to meet a lot and we have them\nOne of the five thousand dollars a year in gold bars to as rats in\n... yeah yeah ... thanks very good\nAnd yet but they're you know there are certain places on the planet that we have agreements and treaties with the other countries and uh you know get most one of the ... that was like yeah\nYeah shut up this is ours now take a walk take it on the ... you know why you Savage your own people and this isn't Cuba's such a great example like yeah we're going to be desperate and\nLocally but I'll go bomb I came down as I ... a buck came down to speak to the ... family and yes we'll give you another thing you'll give us every thing okay oh okay sounds good to me let me a drop some pilots of money and no ... no no no you don't do that yet\nIt's it's incredible um and again I think Iraq Obama on did a lot of the uh what is the\nThe not just the the presidents and the footprint of the United states of America I ... I I heard a British movie reviewer years ago I knew something was going on\nWhen it was a Spider Man movie and at the end of the spider man movie uh he's he's a swaying away and there's the stars and stripes on top of the empire building you know what that British a a a critic said\nYou know and it was a great movie I enjoy the movie but there was no reason to have the stars and stripes waving so prominently at the end of the movie\nAnd I'm like yeah this this globe is moving into a position you know showing you believe that a can of will pass every now and then it needs to be opened up [laughter]\nIt's just very simple simple answer dance part\nYeah but I go I I feel like we are going back to the hammer analogy from earlier I think we're we're opening up the can and and threatening to opening it up far too often I think again there's there's just easier way what have we\nDone what do you think we've done thus far and the two years of the Trump presidency where we uh we came down with the hammer\nWhere we've come down with a look at with well we're we're friends with North Korea ... we're ... we're friends you know we're we're chummy with countries that we'd never previously ... let me let in our enemy are are are longtime allies we treat 'em like chopped liver I mean that's\nI don't agree with that I I look at North Korea ... what was everybody saying about Donald Trump and the little rocket man at the beginning of the had but it's all my God we're going to go to war is going to drop a bomb is titled Trump is out of control we need to impeach him immediately and\nI said okay I'll take a different tact if you will and it takes a different tack these thoughts that diplomatic relations or he gets a few concessions we've got the American uh KIA coming home there remains anyway I'm there has been no frequent the rocket testing last time I checked\nOr is it a solved problem ... no I absolutely agree with you on that it's not a solved problem yet\nWhich way do you know I mean do they do you want it to extreme either way with Kim Jong on\nIs that the him jungle and was it what we're doing with North Korea is what it was successfully doing with North Korea is what we attempted to do with Cuba which is cut them off the promise with Cuba nobody played wrong everybody was\nPlaying with North Korea and I will say\nThe whole bombing thing I I don't know that the biggest concern was a ... a media war with North Korea the concern was and still is and I think a lot of it's being proven out is that by by engaging with North Korea the way we did\nWe legitimize Tim for another generation we gave this guy who we were out in a in a in a in a despot who we're about to choked to death we were literally cut off from almost the entire output outside world he was about to be choked to death and we kicked the stranglehold off of him and said\nWe'll give you another breath and so I and okay to come up\nWith the if we stuck with a for lack of are they being bar goes let's say we stuck with the of the sanctions 'em and you had a North Koreans dead all over the streets wouldn't ... maybe it's my paranoia the media would find a way to blame Donald Trump for that but\nWe would streets they mean they don't know it's it's nothing new and that\nBut now they have the strength to pick up and hide them when they die see that's you know\n[laughter] I just aren't you know I I just I I think North Korea was a success I just don't know that and again I think immigration spent you mentioned that kind of the heavy handed type stuff I think immigration has been one of those issues and\nIt's unfortunate because it distracts from somebody I think is important are things like a border wall as I Do think that there is a conversation to be had to find a way to prevent people from illegally crossing into this country\nAnd one of those ways may very well be the wall but instead\nWe we we get all worked up on these on these political walks these political attached to him and not say All right let's step back\nAnd find a way to handle this issue in any kind of ... going back to the fictional is the kind of traditional way of how do we solve this problem let\nMe acknowledge the political reality when you just pointed out I Do believe was Seventy to eighty percent of the American people are if Donald Trump started to take that uh uh that measured I'm well thought out academic step to the problem which would entail letting them into the country let's be honest\nUm if we if we took the Obama taxes well you know we'll try to figure this out and you have another do ah the fact is a I Believe Seventy to eighty percent of the American public agree with Donald Trump agree with the quick a firm stance we need to get serious about this we're no longer serious about it and um\nAnd and again there isn't a simulation issue that I'll talk about this at a simulation issue with our fellow Americans right now\nUm if you're sitting you're angry with the country All right fine I get it but the fact is English is the language of success and we've had the immigrants arrived here that we always picked on our friends who parents just absolutely listen I'm not going to learn the language I'm a few kids that\nBut they you know they they stayed in it and if they closeted themselves and the rest of the society stay with their friends who spoke the language\nBut now if you go out to a newsstand in New York City you can get a newspaper and any language that you need if you put on the television you can find a showing any language that you need which I Believe hurts assimilation down the road again\nThere's a cultural offering and is there there's a commercial offering there as well people pay for that and I'm and I'm a filthy capitalist so if they want it they should get it\nDid we European newspapers fans previously with German\nOr not there were independent they were independent newspaper companies that opened up and German language or get ... and uh certainly the Gallic ah was here for a wee bit uh but we have the Irish shackled there are Irish newspapers as well so it's a\nA there are there are there were offerings here or ... years ago for the newspapers\nAnd that's what the ... the priority though was you speak the Yankees don't speak the Irish my and my aunt bridges spoke Gaelic but she didn't teach the kids um and and again I think that's the last I Believe it would have been a very nice thing to have them learning the language and now I just get called an arm of Don which is not nice but uh it it's\nI I Do believe assimilation it's not different from what it was when my my uh my mom as a youth and and the their parents have got here as well I think it's different now they're not there's ... there's a there's an intentional resistance to American assimilation today even from our fellow Americans is\nThat in a stream of opinion you\nKnow I I think the perspective is different I think we I\nAnd I don't know what it is but I think historically we've for example and I use I use stone as a prime example ... is a\nCity that lined the streets with a foreign flag now if that flag were a Mexican or Guatemalan we would be up in arms but since it's a European country we think nothing of it we find that ... we find that charming I ... but\nWhy does why does still and why the flags up and what are they doing what's the purpose of those flags\nBe celebrating another country's heritage\nOkay and so and that and to my hesitation of any ah any ethnic restaurant I've ever been and and again the Mexican flag is celebrated all over Wisconsin when you go into a restaurant and when you go and I you know what I think that's a great thing I have no problem with that\nAh when you're celebrating the culture and you know you hear in the state and uh that's a great thing I I think and again I marched in a pipe and do I I you know I was a member of the uh\nUm the the emerald society and the H in order of ... ah I I Love celebrating what my culture is but having been to Ireland having been to Scotland haven't been over all over the u._k. and ah\nI'm In Germany I can tell you one thing I Love coming home love visiting but I Love being the the American and um go ahead\nNo I Know I agree with you but I I think that's\nObviously right now we're in transition if you are if especially if you're from a from a Latin American country in immigration to the United states you're you're first generation\nYou're probably carrying some of the language of carrying some of the chair and you will work in ultimately generation after generation that you'll work in and become part of the American fabric and and again we'll be flying Honduran and Mexican and El Salvador and flags through downtown cities and people will think anything of it in the short time no we're very very I think\nWe're we're I think we're very paranoid of of and very distrustful of them and I know\nI I I I think I'll give you an example is an extreme one I've ... I've said I'm being unfair at the beginning of my point here\nUm did you see massive are rounding up of Middle Eastern people getting shot down by American citizens all over the country the day after nine eleven no but you know the answer is no to that uh we are a therapy pool where a decent people we are a thinking people and again we understand what the melting pot means", "show_name": "Dan O'Donnell", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "22"}
