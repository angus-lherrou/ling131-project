I mean it's just a social but you know and she's going to lose that seat quite from yeah it's it's and it's I think for a yeah man it's so a mansion\nIf matching votes no he loses if he votes yes he wins that's how tight that race is ... ... it boils down to his vote tomorrow and I mean it's just that and he's gone through the skiff a couple of times over the last couple of days\nAnd uh again I I Know why he's doing any stretching it out it's like I'm thinking about everything I'm thinking about he's I think he's avoiding everything that everybody\nUntil you have to take his vote I think he's going to vote yes I think we gotta yes at a job I think I'm right on that protects you know I I\n... I think so what what I what I Wonder about is obviously we've ... brought this up brilliantly before anyone else said had kind of pointed this out which is the solidify vacation of the ... of of Republicans as\nThere was that blue wave talk and I do believe that there's still a blue wave there but I think this debate this conversation\nHas really invigorated a conservatives Republicans\nAnd you pointed this out to get you know and got them engaged in something where I think a lot of a lot of the problem you run into and why you always see often I should say always often see the ... the party in power lose seats in ... terms because ... they don't yeah there's a satisfaction\nThere's the you know what we've got all of our stuff it's um you know it's it's hard to for example for a party to retain the White House or after eight years it's it'd be ... this fight has has really re engage conservative\nConservatives and I think it has changed let's get the one thing though that I Do wonder is does this does this incident does that motivation carry through to November what happened\nI Believe and then I Believe realistically\nThe the races now neck and neck I and I any waves or any uh overwhelming overtake I think that's gone now and you know you know what Paul I'm looking at a especially on this one ... what's that\nNPR PBS or they came out yesterday and they said the league has gone it's it's now it's now washed now push 'em and I and I I truly believe its neck and neck I don't think anybody's significantly in elite anymore does this carry over for the next few weeks does carry over to the beginning of November\nI Believe and we've heard discussion about this over the last couple of days from senators and other politicians\nAre some ... the Bush Republicans are saying well this unity now we're going to get together a Lindsey Graham has become something that people think that he's gone through some sort of transformation he I I really believe he's more outraged at the injustice and the attack of upon Brett Kavanaugh\nAh I think that his anger is legitimate there I I think that's where his anger lives he's also I think become a\nA rational a supporter of president Donald Trump now\nAs I as I decided that I was going to support President Trump a candidate Trump going into the twenty sixteen election I said to myself I'm Sorry a Hillary's too corrupt she's two evils she's too sinister and\nWhen you're willing to lie about the death of a a a personal friend and Chris Stevens was a personal friend invested a Stevens was a personal friend\nBut she that those bodies and in ... ah they were political numbers to her they were political numbers to what President Obama not a biggie let's let's manage this thing let's manipulate this thing oh yeah well said was this at this point directors video\nI'm incredible and yet that night she sends an email to Chelsea are suggesting and and pointing out very very clearly we got hit by

people\nUh I get that I understand that um but as analysis is usually dead on and he he gets a little sensitive when the criticism of the poll takers going into sixteen I don't think that would that far off\nA and it but I Do believe that dynamic the dynamic that um I I think is reality now\nAnd perhaps I'll take your opinion before I pick up the uh calls here I really believe a lot of Republicans independents and uh I'm a conservative or libertarian\nThey're not talking to pollsters anymore they've checked out and I think the damage or that the uh the media at the anti media movement that it's not just Donald Trump or they're going through this for a couple of decades now um I think their trust level is not a journalism is that a trust of all those about thirty percent\nI
