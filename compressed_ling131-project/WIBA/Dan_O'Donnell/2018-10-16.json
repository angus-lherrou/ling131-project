accomplish when they get the house back and they get the Senate back what exactly do they want to do for us to stop being done for us right now\n\nA couple of surveys out today you look at the manufacturing jobs under Mr Obama it was regulation that took those jobs away that's it it was regulation\nIn two years a president Donald J Trump manufacturing jobs are back eight fold eight fold and he didn't run into the town and just open up the factory when he did was just to rip up regulation that was out of control that was meant to destroy the energy industry and Mr Obama made that very very clear\n\nWhat exactly do you have Democrats talk to me baby let me reach out\nTo a a Senator Warren hey hey\nHey ho ho ho\nNow I should be condemned for being a racist mocking this woman no I'm not a racist I'm brutally honest I'm In the face of liars that's what I like to do\n\nAnd the Democratic party has turned into a movement of lives pathological lives\nAnd they were prostitute any

your time today\nThere you are you're just making my point for me ah you said earlier that are Blasey Ford was the Democratic standard for a reason why we shouldn't put a judge on the Supreme Court that's clearly fault\nThat is only the standard if it's a Republican going on the court if the roles were reversed but it was a Democrat that women would be totally\nTrashed and and not well without question ahead but totally not believed\nNo no no no no no no no I Hillary Clinton a created the war room against bimbo eruption she's ready to take on any member options that is going to take out her Democrat\nHusband and heard a Democrat or a contemporaries or a ... in the Congress and she's willing to do it she's willing to destroy 'em ... women who are victims if they don't have the right letter after their name this is the Democratic party\nFor it but my point is they have no standard they literally have no they don't have one goal and that is\nPower and they will do absolutely whatever is necessary and that's why they live by this double double standard now but there are some hypocrisy and the Republicans to\nKnow how to land there's no doubt nearly as much just\nYou know what Steve if our guy gets busted anytime and public any any decides not to resign and guess what he we vote him out the next election that's what we do\nOr the Democrats don't do that and they'll band together they'll get together and scream and and talk about their bodily functions and pledged to blow up the White House and and speak like complete and total psychotic ... and and the members

yeah bad for Republicans all the same to the Democrats are all the same no they're not\nAnd after the bottom of the outbreak we come back to that um ... if you're a voter here in the state of Wisconsin and you looked at the changes that have taken place since July twenty ten and the Republican legislature\nAnd many great Republicans who was voted that you know obviously voted the right way and many of them lost their gigs Janesville comes to mind here\nUm I I Am tired of the juxtaposition of the Republican Party as opposed to the Democratic party by the way by the way\nUm I I think the Republicans are going to rule the day that we're looking at the uh the bunch of of looking at and the the debt we're looking at right now that's going to pop up again and we're not doing the right thing and we gotta we gotta start paying down debt and we're not doing that that's going to come back to bite us\nAh but the Democrats are no longer in a position to talk about that just yet and we

the Democrats' side of the aisle if if you Democrats out there would start calling your representatives and your senators and saying uh yeah we need you to do something about that because by the way this affects your pocket book\nIf you represent most of the minority vote in the country today if you represent what the economic impact is going to be on all the in on those a minority communities um and there are opportunities to get work uh again there's a lot of jobs out there the economy's growing a perfect\nJet I'll be the first to admit that were in the right direction and we've played it recreated a hell of a lot of manufacturing jobs since just ripping up the regulation of the left wing green psychopaths that occurred during the last administration but let me be clear I'm going to put my foot immolations on the ... ... ... don't\nKeep Senate real yeah yes I Do have stopped that level of ignorance the academics came out of their holes in their fields piles and the uh yes this is what I feel as though the president to those ... yeah\nYou gotta you gotta be able to work\nAnd work create cell wealth and were creates opportunity and we do we need to realize that\nWe have an entire generations wiped out academically because they have not been talked with capitalism is really about and what opportunity is and by the way the pursuit of happiness ... it's just that you got to pursue will give it a shot\nBut you got to get out of high school minimum you got to get out of high school that's a biggie you can't\nDrop out of high school and walk around with the next Twenty years saying I'm a victim of victim oh oh oh oh I'm a victim of victim\nYet doesn't work that way you need to pass\nThe test let's go to Mike on line three and so by the way I'm ... there's going to be fighting for those jobs and the higher you go academically there's going to be less competition for the job you may Brazil you see the beauty of the American dream the pursuit of happiness comes with no guarantees\nIn my house you grow up with the potential of always being a bum out on the street who's going to starve to death Mike you're on the day and kind of ratio thanks for your time go
