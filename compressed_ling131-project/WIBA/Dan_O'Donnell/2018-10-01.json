love to say to Collins and Murkowski ... and Harrison and all the women centers I Would love to say did you listen to Juanita Broderick in Nineteen Ninety nine or at least you know it might not digital digit number do you listen to the women with a key element that you listen to them you listen to some idiot\nSaid like man that I think my clothes off I mean again I my head is exploding it really is\nThis is so I can and I I just got one last thing that might be kind of funny it might be useful for the FBI or Saturday Night live skit that if you could really do that they could get Kavanaugh and\nHis friend judge and they could record them laughing all kinds of different laugh and then then do a whole bunch of other two guys you know like a line of\nVocal Kenya identify the last

butthead in their lab into I'm just a thank you this\nThe therapeutic I'm ready to explode I've never heard anybody about what what happened to me and I'm not going to I'm not going to elaborate and I moved on and\nIt was young and it was a big lesson\nBut I mean this is absolute insanity and I very\nCavanaugh I got to say that those senators those lucky senators they were ... and nasty to him and I know they weren't in it\nAnd and you know it during the beginning of the freak show of the uh when it first started not uh when they first started him to be hearing all the women and the screening and everything he was he was totally composed stay there for six hours we were going to start you know this is insane and he's\nNever had a ... they they don't want to let the facts getting the way of their political movement here they they will not acknowledge what you and I both observed last Thursday or they want acknowledge a what a woman comes forward and says listen I've been through hell of

heard the ... and buddy Jeff offend them on a republic or comments last week uh they're leaving that Mike open I'd be very very surprised and I did catch one of the attorneys say just say anything just say yes I did catch that one which was very very telling a pet I Hope this was\nOne less thing Dan All right I remember everything about the incident that happened to me when I was Seventeen and I was drunk and I remember details I remember how I got home where I was who everything\nBut I appreciate your um your can candor today and it's a it's not easy to bring back I'm sure but I appreciate your call thank you so much of a great day\nAnd a three to one Thirteen gentle free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten let's let's go to Carol who's been very very patient on line to Carol you're on the con ratio thanks for your time today go right ahead with your call\nWell thank you Dan for taking my call I'm there to um ... comments basically didn't want to make one has to think in my head and the other is your question at the beginning of the program about you know whether people will continue to vote Democrat or a vote Republican ... after I guess\nUm you know I Want women to be taken seriously about these accusations just like any other crime when it came as you make sense you know a comment it needs to be taken seriously investigate it but you notice I didn't have a lead because unless you can prove you cannot just automatically take sides and say\nI one hundred percent believe the site I refuse to believe that side and Tamar is doing just exactly\nKind of in reverse um he's saying I Believe this woman and there's no way I can believe this man even without any proof and I would suggest that he and others like him play the substitution game let's say tomorrow is accused by a woman of some sort of sexual behavior that he did not do okay\nAnd you know I'm sure he would scream it from the top of the you know the highest building about wanting justice for himself that he didn't do it and you need to believe me but here\nHow many times how many times you argue called evil and you don't get a little bit angry at that and Brett Kavanaugh was labeled as being evil by one of those senators right absolutely\nAnd and even when people talk about his anger and his response as you know that was not a job interview this inquisition and yes an individual trying to protect his family and his reputation in his life and his life's work\nIt didn't I didn't really like it at first that he was saying some of the things he did but I can understand his ... and his anger and here he is on television with these\nYou know holier than thou at some of them committing their own life questioning him and you know basically\nTrying to destroy his life it was awful which is my second point I was a lifelong Democrat up until the second Obama administration election\nAnd in Wisconsin when the Democrats behave the way they did relative to the act and I'm legislation and then became a Republican I'm not a hard right Republican I still\nFeel like I I have a bigger social heart than some of the Republicans\nI you know I think yeah I I think Scott hit the nail on the head and I have had hit the nail on the head as well a lot of us have ... are now a part of a time where\nA ... if if you're a homosexual but if if you hate gay marriage I Can't relate to you because I was raised in an environment where my parents didn't allow that level of uh of of anger and or\nA I'm not saying hatred I'm just saying that uh my ... both my parents who by the way my dad was right of gang is con or he always felt if if you're a guy with a problem with gay people you probably have a problem and you're in yourself\nAnd um and uh you know people get mad at me a lot of my more conservative friends get mad at me because I Do believe the conservative libertarian has now starting to rebuild themselves a cow would you say that's an accurate description\nYeah I Would and I would now I at this point there is no way I could vote for a Democrat either at the state level or the federal level for the way that they hate the divisiveness that they have created by some dividing the ... the citizens of this country into this group and this group and this group\nAnd then you're hitting them all against each other and my last point is that um you mentioned this earlier is well once this week is over it won't matter what his\nDog ... never be enough for the Democrats they'll say oh you didn't investigate deep enough you can investigate long enough you didn't talk this person this way you know um it will never be enough\nAnd I pray for judge Kavanaugh I Hope he can get through this um because I think men in this country it'd be very afraid of what's going on\nAnd I wonder how about my friends I think about my friends who have kids or this age Fifteen sixteen Seventeen\nUm ... it's very different times are living in right now and are these young men need to be a a toll

there might be some beer drinking out of college party\nA yeah it's a there are certain things that haven't changed over the decades and up but uh these young young men today and men are more men in corporate America today have to be very very aware\nAnd uh don't speak out of turn don't just assume that you need to if you're if you're not friends with the individual don't take any liberties\nOr
