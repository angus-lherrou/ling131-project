trying to tell us that how great one point nine percent was yesterday\nDid you go\nThat's that's who they are now about almost ... ... yeah oh okay so if you celebrate at one point nine percent three twenty five percent is more at St larger grill\nOr do I say we're in a complete and total recovery nope I'm looking at the housing markets and some are concerned there but\nUh again the if the president shows up to a rallying rallying to discuss his uh uh the greatness of the country and how you know what what what\nDirection we're in right now and he told me he said you know you're a dangerous that when you root against your own country for the sake of politics your dangerous would go to the calls we've got Mary and Scott let's go to Mary on line one hey Mary good morning you're on the comedy show Happy Friday to my dear\nThat'd be great and how are you I'm OK welcome great\nMe and I was just talking to a quicker in about the family that I went to the park okay 'cause I'm Alice can work for the state\n[laughter] I don't I just wanted to say that it\nWas a hundred and test it on our identities and in a heartbeat um I thought it was\nNeat watching 'em and getting to talk to a lot of other Wisconsin nice people young I didn't realize that was that many people in the states but [laughter] and when I was thinking okay we're not going to be able to get anywhere near um this evening at all but ... which\nAllows people that were actually there on\nOther part that I forgot to tell him when that while we were standing in line there were two protesters that were with a big banner and of course\nThere's two female reporters in there talking to these two protesters with that of the protesters that I uh\nHey Mary ah let me ask you before I go to Scott a did you feel a connection with President Trump that you haven't felt before as a result of being there and and watching watching him a live in in person\nYes I did and it on that don't that even talking to some of the people as well um we're still waiting for him on there was a lot of young adults not old enough to vote yet and I and\nI I just was amazed by that it just brought me back to um my growing up my dad used to\nThe jewel of somebody's now in fact in custody or with the department of justice the FBI and the secret\nService or with cooperation from great agencies across the country and um and again I got another great source of euro and confirming with me that uh as approximately one hour ago that's when this arrest was made\nAnd um again that's through Catherine heritage and Fox News or she's not the one letting me know uh but the fact is about an hour ago that color was made 'em as we get more information about the defendant\nOr we will certainly provide that to you or I I'm not shocked you know and again uh as I said yesterday on this air uh this is not the era of the Unabomber the digital footprint of everybody today whether it's a piece of tape that you bought the hardware store\nUm it's a and here's a detailed that they haven't released yet and I'll give it to you because I don't think it's a very dangerous a one hour ago in Florida there are taking 'em this individual to FBI headquartered in Miami and again we have a great uh sources out there helping\nUs out along the way so uh we appreciate all the help we're getting right now three two one Thirteen ten three two one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen ten and let it be said right now\nI Hope this individual if convicted is a convicted to the fullest extent of the law I and ... with the amount of uh packages and the mailing and the uh the explosive inside the devices even if black powder which\nSome people say it's no big deal yeah big deal to me and this uh just individuals looking at life in prison without chance at parole and that's what I've been told a let's go to Scott On line to has been a very very patient today and well worth the wait as always Hey Scott thank you for your time today brother I appreciate it Happy Friday you're on the income ratio thanks for your time\nOh thank you Dan while you called it you said by friday that they do have them I just want to say first of all I I felt kinda bad for merrier last caller she's like she had the whisper from the confines of some janitorial closet somewhere\nIn the state or a hundred and ... how about the fact\nThat if you have a judge from sticker on your bumper and down south you you're potentially a truck can be burned to the ground or if you're a worker and and again I don't mind a little ah a hesitation and the part of a state worker I think it's good to be hopefully a paranoid\nAnd um yeah and and but you're right it think about the atmosphere that you're working where you believe you have to be quiet and that that ... say something like that\nThe culture there is obviously toxic would I Want to say though you know you're you're talking about uh about having discussions with people and then the left unable to speak with\nCertain groups of course um I think I was ... that we're all Americans so it really shouldn't be any problem to speak with people um and I was thinking the nature of your show with everyone says you know it's kind of like el going up to the bar and having a discussion yeah ... they have to\nHave to use the the dump button on him because uh the expletives come out\nWell they they obviously Scott they obviously hit the ball before they came to the show that\n[laughter] and then nine o'clock in the morning I told them that don't we all come on [laughter] no but I I just\nFound it bizarre thinking about that that you would literally have full they're listening to show for for years at least sensitive session in session and\nThey haven't moved the question or a pivot or at least become somewhat ... toward what is really an evil id ideology uh the contrast between Obama as President Trump's\nBy now the only thing that's the the constant is the hatred of the left them both and they weren't happy one Obama was in office and there certainly are happy now that's that's the only the only constant is the last page\nYeah so I got you know what I I it was funny as a and we shouldn't forget to discuss that they do the hatred of the left how many people walked away from Obama when they realized she wasn't going to get everything done then they hated him for not being radical enough when he first started out for a very\nSmall percentage of the population including the media and a and our cultural Hollywood\nDoesn't that speak to the checks and balances of Congress and on the Senate and the house and you know the American people saw what was coming and they put a stop to it and God Bless them for doing it and I think I Know\nAnd before it got so enough areas that couldn't be stopped by a buddy of mine who is not real political but he very seriously said Scott do you think if Hillary Clinton got elected that we would have seen her
