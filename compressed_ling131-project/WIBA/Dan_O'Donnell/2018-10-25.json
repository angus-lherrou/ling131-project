I mean\nAll right Peter I appreciate that but the fact is that decision was made by a guy named John Miller\nWho was the former deputy commissioner public information for the NYPD is now a deputy commissioner for intelligence and terrorism\nInvestigations um I think he's very wisely and in fact I compliment them I think it was a good move because if if this was a mass mailing and you get that one envelope on TV you're not celebrating the bad guy 'cause he's not a discovered yet\nUh but again you don't want your for celebrity to well the unknown terrorists domestic terrorists are but in this case it actually paid off um the uh the postal worker and try Becca\nSaw this information he said holy crap I saw one of these are in our building and he went back and and he was right it was correct um\nI heard that twice you heard that ...\nRight now the thing about it I used to be an loader for about Thirty years and I use double based powder which will only burn black powder will explode or right after that I heard a lot of people come out and say well there's a ... a operation because none of these things exploded the\nThing about it is that all you need ... park and black Potter will go up\nSo this thing that confuses me about this is how can it be if false flag operation when they're just sell when they're sending 'em um packages out that require very little to go up and the thing\nBothers me ... ... ... let's just let's start from here\n... yesterday when I had one and I said hey you know I'm getting nervous year my and I I Am showing people if I was getting jaded and and uh I was concerned about my own thought process\nUm let me all the this chicken you start out at reasonable suspicion mere suspicion and probable cause I'm Still at mere suspicion right now\nI because I don't know enough about the uh the uh the items the materials and I are reasonable suspicion they're only reasons why I'm I'm offering some opinion here and some theory is the fact is you have nine devices\nThat have obviously traveled extensively that have obviously been handled by either a a a Amazon personnel FedEx personnel UPS enjoy the United States Postal service they've been jostled they've been moved day but not thrown on a heat 'em they hit ... there were a originally brought to well location to mail originally\nSo they ... it was transported at that point then you'll have delivery of a few items it's handled the bite you\nThere's the um a postal service end or FedEx or or UPS or is it again nine devices none of which were detonated that tells me I'm ... that could potentially be a signature of I didn't want it to explode I just wanted to scare some people\nUm again I heard the description of black powder or do we know that the law enforcement official knew what they were talking about at that time again I like to speak to people who are in the know if I if I see a situation I speak to a good homicide detective or a bomb squad technician\nAnd I was very fortunate to work with a lot a lot of uh people\nUh when I was in the NYPD pipe and a lot of emergency service cops which are swat bomb tax hostage negotiator stay there are just a package of everything um\n[noise] I'm Still at reasonable suspicion Chico and we don't know enough about any of the materials for for me to sit here and say it was ABC and the and that's my opinion and that's it so the false flag I'm suspicious about about a few things here but I'm starting to think more cycle than political activists that's that's where I'm at right now\nDo you think the newspaper just simply use the wrong word\nNo because I I recall the law enforcement official using that phrase as well\nUm so I ... that could be the case that I'm not going to condemn either way here I'm In Chico you raise a good point you're and you have experience and you have background or so ... got thrown in your head um that again my hackles are up but I'm not going to say anything definitively 'cause we don't know enough\nUm this is this is the struggle of being an investigator or a police officer or if you're a cheap out they're managing something like this um I don't envy that individual leave we'll get a call the shots were going to say what we're going to do at what point\nI'm going to obviously have a guys at my crime scene I'm not going to have them leaving to a campus I Want them on the crime scene because I don't want anybody else touching that crime scene and my guys doing the cameras gals out there doing the canvas I'm going to have them do just that\nI don't want them involved in the physical evidence if they don't come across anything ah there's very very specific reason for that\nAnd um and I recall I told the fungal thing [laughter] showing a ... you remember Mr fond don't you [laughter] and I'm from the OJ trial and it's a\nYou know lessons learned from mistakes and that's the beauty of being a part of a law enforcement agency Sean you get to um be introspective after those mistakes are made and you hope that no careers are destroyed\nA but at the same time you want to learn from your mistakes and then go ahead\nAnd you mentioned you know whether it goes through a facility or or what I Know like for example the the CNN one that they were showing on the TV yesterday\nOn a you know for those of us living in Madison were not overly familiar if you live in the city there's there's plenty of of this which are messenger and Crick courier services which you know you're basically using an intermediary to deliver that and people were saying well why wasn't the CNN package why were those stamps not voided why we're there no you know we're all amateur investigators\nThere is a pretty good chance that that could have been simply delivered by somebody that\nThey didn't use the postal service arrange that there were a courier service that literally just took it from point a to point B never going through a male sorting facility never going through FedEx or UPS the U.S postal service it could have literally been been hand delivered to using genetics out by a biker or walk or a banner exact um other way so\nYeah a good break down and I'll tell you right now or ... you know you you and I have friends that are big media outlets are back east and west\nUm I can say right now if you send stuff to our friends at Fox News or it's going to take a couple of days because they have an entire facility on the side of the building a with a private entrance\nAll packages must go through this they get screened they get tested uh they even have a genius are testing gunshot residue testing are involved in that office I mean this how serious they take that I'm sure CNN is at the same level I mean you have friends all over the media world ... and it's picked up everywhere hasn't it\nOh yeah you know we're a pretty important stuff as well you know regrettably just in the world we live and isn't it and let's go to Scott who's going to be the voice of reason is always today and I appreciate that Scott Scott thanks for your time you're on the ratio pal thank you\nWell I appreciate that moniker and that's of course but uh I don't know if it give\nYou that you can you going to blow me out of the water with dogs are I\nGet ... I'll be honest okay first of all the the main point years once upon a time because none of this again is in a vacuum and we all have our own experiences and uh\nAnd and the ... the current news cycle and everything is going on\nA a affects our a judgment and one of them was the first thing I thought was a you know once upon a time to be\nA ... it's it's a lot but there are some nut or Islam that is a mailing bop a especially to politicians and\nUh now we've moved into the realm of domestic terrorism and that that is not a good thing if all of a sudden this gets the sanction of well it it it's okay to mail bomb it's okay to actually terrorize their own country\nAnd by the way who is again where I guess we can it's now it's time to move into the political arena out here uh who has been saying that it's okay to get in the face of a a politician at a restaurant and say okay ah do harassed somebody to the point where where they have to feel they have to leave the restaurant or have a\nA you know when I say that I put the blood on the hands of the Democratic party or for Steve ... is that an outrageous statements Scott is the only right\nNow it's a it's a harder to wander the ratio against Republicans in fact he just had a story a Jeremy Ryan segue boy from act can critter and left wing activist attempting\nTo by ... by the way a God Bless my local media outlets here in Madison and uh and the parts of far as well or the description a was a ... no stranger to law enforcement no\nTitle of left wing activist known title of the very very aggressive in your face I read all the local media outlets not one descriptive of a violent violent yeah and if there are there\nActually people on there saying oh well he ran as a Republican so yours no he's not he's ... he was ... already a I got as much money as he could be the left wing activists being the guy that has cancer and going to die anytime the guy with a bad heart\nI ... and he moved on to kill the side they're trying to make some money off of a Tea Party and the guy if the garbage what I Want to know as I said that these people are so he's a Republican because he says he has no not but who is the target who is he targeting and what are you going to\nGet out ... ... and that's the outrage here because uh okay I'm going to give law enforcement uh certainly a time to process the information and won the individual who might have been a target and and that's a responsible stance by law enforcement\nI Know that this media outlet knows who it is um and ... and Scott this is this is where the politics come in\nAre you going to tell me segue boys Republican you know Kiss My yeah I guess that's my response to that one a number to this was an aggressive as Scott Walker hitter and aggressive Republican hater and an aggressive left wing activist and yet if this guy was a member of the right wing cause it was a really truly identified right wing organization\nIt would've been stated in the article today he's a member of this right wing groping organization possible white supremacist\nBlah blah blah dark dark dark\nWell my response to that is a missed Hillary Clinton in fact you know what I'm going to ambush on people that I I Want to juxtapose Hillary Clinton's comments from last night we mess stopped the ... this is the same chick who just a couple of weeks ago said we can't be civilized

but\nIt's a good job of some of the Unabomber\nYeah yep I agree with your pal and now I mean\nThese guys will come out what it is going to go\nTo John I I can tell you that the ah the only upside to what the investigation is revealing right now and I'm not going to divulge my source but they feel that ah these bombs were I created not to go off a that's that's what his\nTake me some Columbia copycat moron there'll be more on ...\nSomeone could make a sophisticated or would it look\nYou know it but I got him a call buddy I'm a good John ah you\nKnow to create my life's good to hear from you as always let you hear me All right brother a three to one Thirteen cents for each one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five Thirteen than I did this at an age forty I Want to do it again now if you look at the law enforcement response to these devices are first you clear to clear the area as a life first\nA safety first a member safety as well or you don't want first responders or at getting injured\nUm there's a bombing back in the ... and I go back two years ago where in Ireland that was ... it was just a sinister in every way um\nBut ah I ... when\nAnalyze this device you looking for a afterwards are deemed safe\nAnd again you had a the NYPD twice over the last two days or run a explosive devices up to ... which is where all ranges outdoor arrangements\nI'm a ... if they don't need to be detonated if the deep secure and you can save a lot of the materials as we stayed at the top of the hour news or the FBI is going to get a lot of information off this with the secret service in ATF\nUm again I Can't the uh the I applaud the fact that the joint terrorism task forces on this and when you have a support team like the LAPD and the NYPD to back you up and what we can give every any help that you need a that's a hell of a team you don't want to mess with um [noise] you know you look for a look at the commonality with the envelopes the writing the printing\n'em there was allegedly a a a a a kind of a mockery of an ISIS flag on one of them I again I don't have the evidence in front of me or you look for a postal a markings and uh and and dates if that's not on there you think UPS you think are fed ex\nUm so it's there's a lot of different or new wants to see her that investigators are going to have to go through a very very methodically\nUm if you look at the wiring and if you look at the materials used and if there's a commonality ah it let's say there's a lot of metal pipe there there'll be a serial number somewhere there will be one and a again\nLook at the bank or that is used to print out stuff I guess what you can run that down you can track that down now it's really interesting\nUm and it's also very very scary for the bad guy and I and I hope it is it should be a three to one Thirteen ... Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five thirteenth ten I just appreciate the uh the law enforcement response the last couple of days they've been fabulous uh from coast to coast\nAnd I again or nothing but a face and the FBI and the secret service on this one this is going to be a\nUm again I I Do agree with my classmate Bernie Bernie character I I think somebody probably being comes by the potentially tomorrow or let's go to BJ online who's been very very patient hey BJ how you doing you're on the comedy show that she attorney today\nHow's it going you know I don't know I'm just being very cynical or or an art or whatever but I I find that you know very kind of just the timing of it all the fishy\nWhat's happening with the caravan come out that it's been you know a hundred by law when groups and Venezuela you know I'm going towards getting it terms and all these things happening\nI'm just wondering if it ever comes out that this was like you know make it ministry\nShould look at because of the elections well the media even talk about it or well\nI'll tell you what he is my biggest concern BJ if the Democrats win the house you we will never find out any of the answers to this these questions will never get them that will be gone forever I'm yet\nI mean am I being too too farfetched Jeremiah\nPJ I ... I you know I Would I Would love to be your oracle of a of a guidance here but the fact is I asked the very same question about myself yesterday am I so jaded\nOr that I'm willing to uh uh dismiss this is something political something that's been a contrived\nUm I I shouldn't do that yet but so responsible of me and a BJ let's try to keep the faith for now let's try to think it was just one psychopath\nDecided that this was the time to send a message and we as Americans will send him or her message after they get apprehended I'm BJ I'm with you I I question myself every day and my two jaded and my two uh\nAnd my two dark in my heart right now to say that this is a non political and not set up\nUm I Hope it's not that that's where I'm at right now BJ I Hope that hunger why\nIt's hard to think otherwise when you see everything that's been happening or you know the whole ... thing with just yeah just the things that are coming out ... ... it's like it's kind of stuck during his thinking itself isn't really this bad are we really this divided country oh are we really stupid missile\nOr power you know what a BJ I Believe the ... the party the Democratic party has that low I think they're that divide and I think they're that angry hospital in dangerous\nWhere they uh they believe by any means necessary is their right political paradigm to uh to focus on um uh again the Republicans are told oh we must come together with about ... will stop shooting us on the ball field has about that number one\nAnd a and you know accusing us in attacking us in a assaulting his verbally out in public and obviously you have a ...\nOr if you're a conservative speaker they destroy burn and the and interrupt that is what they do and they saw people at Trump rallies physical assault taking place against Trump supporters a lot of false flags a where a committed those Trump rallies as well\nUm it is what it is a BJ and I I Hope it changes I don't think it is for a while there was a radical uh existence within the Democratic party that is now so socialist communist\nUm if the if the party doesn't get rid of them I Hope the American people can vote them out or or just to make the Democratic party wake up to their hostility there danger their anger their destruction has to come to an end\nOr it's just that simple BJ thanks for the call today we got to take a break\nIt's Eighteen past the hour preach my mental illness is driving the the speed of the show would you agree with that my friend you're making me work with the incumbent I shouldn't even be speaking with you [laughter] well you know\nThe door Dan for black voter I think the Republican Party said hey we don't want you we don't want you just didn't waste is to be any of our party I think that opens the door for black voters so that's a crowded party which will complain about all the time as having All right like\nThe Republican Party can make up for those same voter but you can't do that and and I think I said well all I can do\nI I Would I be we do not that great you know I Would I Would love to have yeah I\nI Would love to have a a an hour debate with you I I Would enjoy that Anthony and I'll tell you what a when I when I mentioned the Steve ... the man was shot on the ball field by a by a Democrat or by a radical by the left wing psychotic who had a list of Republicans he was going to shoot up\nUm are you looking at what the uh uh a Republican leadership and other conservative and other speakers out there whether it's Berkeley you burn the island getting\nThe right than the rice and mailed to her\nYeah yeah I you know what I think we as a country ... are genuinely genuinely fair people I think we're generally decent people and um\nAnd again Anthony look at you you're a Buffalo Bills fan and you ... for that no [laughter] do any ah\nDo we tell you down for that answer you know what I'm saying is I I'm not black so I Can't pretend to understand your experience I'm not going to see them returned yeah listen I grow up in a a tough neighborhood I'm not black so I I didn't go through when you went through I did see racism when I was a kid and you think in the seventies you know it was going to be a little gun and I saw some outrageous stuff\nUm what was I called the white devil cracker blue eyed monster when I ... a good response to family disputes yeah I was you know I never took it personally they were angry though going through a difficult time in their lives and they saw the blue eyed crack a devil I'm I'm actually green eyed\nAnd on the ... but I was walking and they would just um there were angry they were upset I didn't I didn't think black folks as a whole racist towards me a lot of them didn't like me because of what I did end up but at the end of the day if I was a good cop\nI could come that situation down everybody was happy and they were thanking me by the time I left\nThat being said or the or they're racist within law enforcement yes yes there are and I think every agencies introspective\nOr they are critical and they tried to hunt these people down in their ranks and get rid of them and we will do the best we can but when you recruit from the human race it can be difficult some days I'm going to you you you are ah\nYou you lay down a reasonable argument that I should I should be able to have a pet a tent with you and I appreciate that that I think will disagree on a lot\nBut um if I if any courage at all I should debate you and I appreciate your phone call today\nI appreciate your taking my call and thanks a lot lower\nCould really have a good day pre shade time uh thirty three ... is that a racist comment I called I say the word brother a lot and my black friends who I grew up with they let me get away with it but I you know black Pepsi then you can't say that do you say and do you say to people regard him you do I know the students yeah I Do\nYeah I don't I I think in ... it's like you mentioned that is one of the things I've noticed over the years is there are certain people that that act\nDifferently around like black coworkers and stuff like that yeah that's a little that's a little weird but if you're consistently like either now or do not let out yeah that's\nThat's all black folks who told me by the way growing up as a kid black folks told me what their what their radar was for races like yeah you know the white person goes up and you keep looking away keep looking down like hey how's it going just you know Oregon fairly young clutching the bag [laughter]\nI just thought that that that could be a problem and are you know some people are just so they don't want to ... ... Americans are so decent today they don't want to say any ... anything raises and they're constantly questioned themselves that racist\nBut it's really bad you know I just am I wrong I should have had to Anthony offer that calls when we got to take a break if we're late for the bottom of the hour news um that is the one and only sharp people dirty stay out of he's not going to be here tomorrow they say they account ratio news talk thirteenth ten WMBA [noise]\nFamily and Lewis second suspicious package meant for former vice president Joe Biden been intercepted at a male facility in Delaware and officials saying in his similar markings to the nine others also sent two prominent Democrats\nMe most of those targeted by telling the president to stop blaming others for anger in this society representative Maxine Waters telling blood that he\nTalked about moving up on people and taking them out on a stretcher and even said\nA ... they're lawyers' fees to get them out white\nHouse press secretary Sarah Sanders pushing back let's\nNot get lost and who is responsible for this heinous act it is the person who made and that leads suspicious packages\nAnd an official confirming to Fox News at eight roughly eight hundred US troops headed to the southern border to help with\nThis caravan of thousands of migrants live\nFrom the group health cooperative\nHe's continuing\nNews talk through\nGet what you want to be a\nGood morning I'm Gerry bell the FBI is as a matter of scenario and tried to buy radioactive materials you kill someone Jeremy Ryan is used frying via leaving those radioactive material online on two occasions this year\nThat's the gators did not say Ryan target was President Trump condemned political violence at a campaign rally in Wisconsin last night was in the area campaigning for Governor Walker and we will fare\nThere's another million dollar lottery winner the Madison area in Wisconsin Lottery officials say a million dollar ticket was solely Madison assigned hormone drawing a Monday someone bought a million dollar making millions to get him out for him\nThe very up on the weather is that are twenty seven foreign practice ... if you'd agree that news the top of the hours they can I just want him for seven to ... be eight on Tom from a group of new center Harry's oh\nThe shoe box and black or has the best selection of right wing boots tough regarding company made in the usa\nMS R.
