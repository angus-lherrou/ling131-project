orchids Senate campaigns reporter eh political has a look at the challenge from democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke James took us up\nEspecially after Ted Cruz is trying to pick things up and she'll campaign you know the first couple of months you for taking on really of\nPresident Trump we are very different Sen Cruz them oh we saw what you came to the Senate in ... he was working collaboratively with his colleagues he was working collaboratively White House he was working very hard to kind of the inside given get things done and so what we're seeing now is in the last six weeks there was some concern\nSenator Cruz a face and a little bit of trouble from ... you know the the massive\nDemocrat keeper sharper tone and record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and uh you know one thing that Senator Cruz says not rely on in the past but that he was able to rely on and get help with was the party establishment kind of coming in and helping them out you know the vice president raising money\nOr the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down and campaign for him or so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the the quintessential outsider candidate got to get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the rates and make it to you know give him an edge on there and check the\n... how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting what I think you're probably from Ted Cruz's supporters his hardcore supporters they would argue that you know the conservatives are banned but he always was a huge scale you know you have an abandoned his values one of one of the person I talked to protect the comments actually you know Ted Cruz a changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you'd see a collapsed\nHis support for a and that's not really what's happening is that he's just relying on helping the more collaborative he's from a bomb thrower and that that you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters has got it\nWhat is he a as you said the pieces campaign ... earlier this year uh what why is that what it would have Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign [noise]\nBut I think the thing about that orchids he taught us money and out of the ... um you know he only crazy amounts of money he was told in these rallies that you know thousands of people who were going to and and he he kind of sort of a little bit of a movement um\nAnd I was on the currency without sending pictures on TV and not very surprising a\nDemocrat could be out fending an out raising at a Republican impact that especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so I just talked a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real impact and\nI think his campaign and looking from Texas kicked into high gear towards the end of summer and and going into the fall out of your life and that they ate the challenge and then they quit step it up and call in shows that that that group of leading pretty clear he's not running away with it but he's got a healthy safely\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to take it and again they were hitting the couch I'm Better at any rate thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter wow that is just an absolute record\nFor speak with James Oregon Senate campaign reporter for political views wrote a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz stand it down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act Republicans by turkey on it for a pack and you remember famously Ted Cruz shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got the defendant you know he was ... rallies outside the capital and he was really sort of outside pressure\nForce on the Republican inside the Capitol if their hand and he did exactly force their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and folks in the capital and to the the new time around in twenty Seventeen he was a meeting with Republican
