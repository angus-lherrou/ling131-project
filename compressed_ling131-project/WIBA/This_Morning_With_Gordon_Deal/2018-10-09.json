I'm ... and greens because you'll see some entities that are like that have purple and green\nI'm looking I look and glass you know if you take a picture and and like if you're in your truck ... you know the river there take it you know look at that specifically\nUm um\nAlso have a lot of tips on 'em 'cause you know get their coast right it's not like we're at an old and mills now portrait studio if they're still around and they know the old mill studios are but\nThey're not saying they're waiting posing to say yes step a picture of what I find to be the most interesting thing and I can find a ghosts and virtually any photograph now and not even that I take that anybody takes\nAnd I'm really dying for people um that that was upon for people to send me there photographs because I flip them into negative\nAnd when you flip the picture and negative you can see things that you don't see when you first take the picture so there's like little apps called pick shop is the one I use and I'll put a photo in there and I'll just hitting negative and it just slips that\nTo the negative and you'll see a lot in there\nTruly do you want to give out a special email for people\nThat's not the business related\nYeah you know what were you send an email to Julie rigor R.

Tom Dan ... loan who'd Sean lauded sure\nStephanie Smith Chris morals too but all the George zap\nI'm George Norris somewhere out there on coast to coast am we'll see what our next additional tool that can be said for [noise]\nBreakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are on the liberal side of things so we are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory\nAnd so he's in a position where the court could do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some\nInflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and the whole process just is not to sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief will be to to try to steer the court through the\nRegion are pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another part of somebody you know\nHow do you steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him dear it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times\nThe cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors\nIncremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not the sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times and on\nOn issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so [noise]\nYou know that the calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not\nBe able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary ... meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now all of a sudden the the high court is\nUnder this renewed spotlight\nPromoted to when they go through the confirmation process they have some visibility for a little while but then that kind of fades\nBut you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge\nFor him will be just to get back to the judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice to us I mean if if a new justice Kavanaugh\nTakes very bold stances in cases\nYou know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate and the end to forge common ground with [laughter] you know with a cross section of people in the court didn't than maybe slowly that that sort of makes things a little better for him\nPlay sprint at ...

happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr juice or law\nPsychiatry and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly unpack and what they do if their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat that's\nInto their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and\nSo I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who are sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens and it's kind of an accident and horrific situation fruit cake too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious to crash\nAnd so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and Center You're out and realize\nThat you're not that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's done some research on that and I think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror\nNeurons are the compassion their own in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such a interesting I'm standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons that compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on her teens scan and you know that you love and they're getting ... with a needle Iran mirror neurons get activated that much more showing highly empathic painful\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse\nTo begin to set those boundaries well one thing I suggest all light impact patient is fat and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on friday\nNegative news it's just too much trending on them and people become addicted to that so many facts go out in nature matter exercise Brandon lab that

criticized the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive paper when you hear things and and they don't want to be around energy vampires so I write about they're just doing your energy\nWe're speaking with Dr Judith oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and
