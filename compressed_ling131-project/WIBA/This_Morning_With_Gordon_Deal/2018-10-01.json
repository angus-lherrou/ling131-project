[laughter] they're supposedly not connected to the Internet not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's also not touching um water the election

either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't though\nAs you point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of

make them seem risk list\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nGot to Christ basically because who uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk whether we're bankers who thought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on\nAnd ever since all of us bankers investors and we it's individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts sort of crises [laughter] but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting so you you wrote household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't all year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well um [noise] we're in Asian countries so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who couldn't buy a house\nAnd also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand of the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted [laughter] you don't have as many people going to start their own business and partly because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age in a sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your bagels here and you're ... a month there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley [laughter] what people want is to not start next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook\nThe level of new business is being formed is actually historically quite low I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nNo we're speaking with Greg Ip chiefs economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or they're not related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bold mark markets climb a wall of worry that is to save everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate\nAnd fell into that so in some sense that some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects you're less likely to get a bus in a recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter] I don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but up about which\nThe risk to start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis [laughter]\nBut you know risk there but kinda like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill encounters a barrier try to find a way around it and and\nWe hear happening now some of the risky types of loans that banks will make like to like heavily companies [noise] those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds [laughter] so you in some sense skill at risk out there is just informed that we're not used to when we can't
