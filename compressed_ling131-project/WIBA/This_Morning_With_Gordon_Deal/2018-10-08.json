dot com ... what's that number means\nMeans that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so ah we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight much board ... unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected an essential adjusted about projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment and our country and we've been below that level four\nEighteen months so [noise] uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers employers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would have expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent to ... percent actually a bit of a backtracking lair\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with mark ... senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kind of waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously\nA well for one that's an average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nAh and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so [noise]\nUm for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked by people like me a nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the but you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth and expected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend another words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years [laughter] or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nBut I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cut begin to fade and ...
