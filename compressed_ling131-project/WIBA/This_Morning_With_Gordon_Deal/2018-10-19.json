Eliza ... got the scoop it was what do we know\nHe has really shine off spraying he's like he's going to try to paint he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbent who currently like hand can fall [noise] our\nIncoming areas helping their incoming Republican candidate like trying to catch the because he's retiring\nWhat do you keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nHe always had a pretty aggressive schedule because he can read lots of money at a party keeps range I was seven eight million dollars on up\nParty with a lot of that going to keep these candidates safer attempt to keep these candidates saint Pete certainly doesn't he's not running again and keep an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of just basically like a day on multiple districts and\nJust go kind of on his final spent that we should remember retiring\nAnd it was really how they'd like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nShe's so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his side\nThat I thought this is really interesting as well I've spent on the last couple of years having the Freedom Caucus and get out from there and in his head of trick conservative fire rate members of his party will threaten\nOr in some cases have actually sunk legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough on Republicans named two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass anything\nAnd they can go right now on their own um\nBut they need to buy in from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that they have power when they started voting bloc and they've done and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them one of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus is not just a rank and file member but he swam to people making these decisions on what they'll think and what they'll vote for it but he all three of them are facing really competitive races\nSo we're speaking with allies are Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is hitting the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates that what kind of messaging well he have does or does it change from Canada to candidate\nWill come candidate a candidate what how do will change from Canada to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate\nBut his messaging basically it's like you're better off Republican leadership on the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course it actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking that the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed\nInto on their President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tiny little bells all grouped together a lot of vulnerable Republicans had their names on those bells and painting and all that but the message basically being you're better off Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey are going further and further can\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nWell I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even\nBeing counted out already by Republican
