America's\nFor get along with it ... thanks for\nJoining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura ... distill the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty or fix to as just\nAbout three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I covered with all the time and I know that right to to be a deeper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as adults I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get bear all that soon\nHum with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past that I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nSo yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner had the rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a moral has a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nWe're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing up price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in front of the more\nExpensive markets um but I went to somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more about price production so\nWhat does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think it means that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high but I Do think for a virus that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe address their prices down or the bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate that program is brought you buy Brooklyn in

C. [noise] and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [laughter] and I'm so initially it's always\nIt's about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend is recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story ... absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or say while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticing fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with ton al hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat that each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still\nTo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the school for that friday", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Madison", "day": "12"}
