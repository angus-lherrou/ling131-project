into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance\nYou know if I told you and\nThen in the Nineteen nineties that ah\nI'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics [laughter] but now it is increasingly the case that non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people and much more likely to be Republicans a you know we're seeing a much clearer\nSort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented whites and non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nA so we see the pillow race along with religion or increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that's hard to trust that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that

country is late with your home town and whichever one of those is important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing or what you're thinking about\nSo political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identities over other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's more important and then worrying about the federal deficit but political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing\nThat shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us 'cause most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are

more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to an al hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we uh I actually reached out to every state all shifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant role districts and um\nThere's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural districts in early spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started\nAre so at the medical marijuana been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know\nThey have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so [noise] you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and\nAnd you know if you if you watch the videos and stuff coming in from Canada folks are kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with ... personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's it costs breakdown is it done it done by al so I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth of announced that but the measurement a youth [laughter] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of an out so you know for full out you know multiply that out be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere was the most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but never the last you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up by dispensaries they're still having to you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level in for that make things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana that changed perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we can be more with Canada\nYeah no so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it
