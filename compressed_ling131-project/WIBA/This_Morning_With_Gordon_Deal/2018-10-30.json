thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and\nMinority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up and quite a bit of mid term advertising on specific to President Trump we found that he is only topped by two other issues in mid term to advertising in that health care\nAnd taxes [laughter] um so he says number three in most common theme in terms of advertising\nRight and then in terms of those themes he is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually there's\nA surprising amount of positive trends ads out there when he found that even I'm In a Democratic Senate and he's turning up in a\nPositive supportive way that scene in places like Indiana West Virginia where the Democratic senator it's trying to hold onto his seat and said that Trump won quite a bit\nAnd twenty sixteen types of advertising like Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly thing when you heat for Hoosier I'm with him and another ad in\nWest Virginia has a candidate you know kind of saying I work with President Trump when he does what's right for West Virginia to theirs and supportive Jones in that type of advertising one thing that really interested me about this data was who found that although you think that President Trump you know with the\nLower than typical favorability ratings and how much he dominate the news would be just blowing things out of the water and turned to the negative advertising President Obama actually far and away surpass him as a meal in in advertising back in twenty fourteen times during his\nPresidency and that you're fifty percent of all Republican ads were anti Obama into for parents purposes Trump opposition type ads make up to Fifteen Percent of democratic ad\nAbout that and then uh speaking of Democrats for Nancy Pelosi practically all the ads have a negative reference to her\nReally difficult to find anything positive about Nancy Pelosi and advertising and that carries from not just a Republican advertising but even democratic advertising that a little bit here and there during the Democratic primary races and we found that\nAbout nine percent eight nine percent of all ads out there have a sort of an anti proceed message so that really shows that Republicans
