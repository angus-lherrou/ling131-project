package delivery services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from time to time coming in\nBut it it has been my experience in the past that the delivery people coming in to office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day\nUnless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know is asking may where's second such\nYou know if they said on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air site for that I gotta go gotta go gotta

dollars has been spent\nSince Labor Day on broadcast TV\nBy candidates it's a story by Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic part of the u._s._a. today network round give us some numbers\nSo Phoenix the cheap the TV market a forty one thousand ads on just broadcast television that doesn't include all the cable channels as well so it's even worse than it sounds but we are a number one market in the country that turned out for a huge\nPolitical ads and you know as I noted in the story if you think that it may be\nBetter in Tucson for example there are actually number three over thirty thousand so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded with political messaging\nBoy and the majority of the ads feature what races\nYou know it's kind of way finger is is really the big one a this is the race between Democrat curious in cinema and Republican Mark and mix Sally ... one of the last ... competitive wages on the map it looks like right now so it was just\nRecently bought well financed and uh had its share of sort of ugly messages from both sides but especially each alarmist messages from the uh\nA mix Sally ally camps\nAre those are my layman's observation you're the nasty ones tend to get exhausting after a while or are focused saying to you that I'm okay enough already can we fast forward the calendar November six\nYou know somebody posted a great tweet on this they should know practically begging for a car commercial\n[laughter]\nAt all I mean that's what it's come to where we're just like we're we're tired of this people are like skipping TV they're just sitting it out for the next couple of weeks\nOr they're tired of this messaging it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the way the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start\nAnd uh you know people here have seen that across the board for us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we're are increasingly politically competitive states so this is something that yeah we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't\nYou know car carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely seeing a lot more action on both sides\nWell speaking of Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic get aids east central dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nYou got a piece about how Phoenix has just been overwhelmed with political ads this election year um you mentioned to kind of more broadly this has been significantly sharper increase over the last midterm election was that the measurement\nYeah it it's a it compared to the ... terms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what we're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of the stage growing political value or on the board\nOr Arizona used to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's so far lighter to these ... Democrats feel pretty optimistic about their chapters and a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call\nAnd so we are just a you know inundated with the ... uh outdoor ... negative and a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nTend to lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have as much financial power to do it so at any price they would have\nBeen relatively low octane a campaign and we have a Democrats running for example in in each house waves are they are challenging guts move for us and ah these are some times low budget affairs\nAre we even have some Republicans running in places where they don't normally rod ... so you know they are at least a casting these races\nBut again these folks are are pretty far away from having a PG money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps consistent negativity can actually work against a candidate or is it a TV is king and candidates are going with it\nYou know look at people who actually hate negative advertising but the fact is that sort of help define your opponent and so people still do it it's still leaves an impression with voters and the question is\nWhether there's enough there to someone down close enough that whatever you might be offering looks more attractive and and that's just kind of the tunnel model in politics", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "26"}
