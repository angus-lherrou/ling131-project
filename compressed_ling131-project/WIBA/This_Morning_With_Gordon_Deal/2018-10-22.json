when the\n\nWeather is walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or in districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still\nRepublicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot at a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christine explain is\nWhat I was thinking it in particular where races that were kind of at no word that they can they not cycle and people didn't think would become competitive back in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than\nPeople expect that they would and seen that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter] so maybe at forty nine percent to carry a ... percent districts you know he comfortably carried by where there is more room for a Democrat [laughter] pick up votes if people had come to satisfy but the president and\nSo one of them was like in a in Washington state explain\nNo one yet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two wasted in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory\nIn recent years but it has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congresswoman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as did the\nHighest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual waste there in that um that hasn't been considered you know one of the swing districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points\n[noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great well\nAll right how 'bout to Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger and democratic female opponent and this is the year when does candidates are attracting a lot of\nEnergy and enthusiasm from voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women\nAre showing more of a preference for a democratic controlled house\nAnd are also more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of mid term that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like women are more ... to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hitting their\nDraw to speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tightened as mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman Rob a little\n[noise] yes this is an interesting race um would all is definitely being outraged by Carole and a boy do who was also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of more like classic suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first\nBlack woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that um are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and uh so do you know vacant seat Republicans feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise]\nUh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter]\nUm this is a little bit probably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be um [noise] a little bit more of a stretch their\nChristina it's Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson\nWas walking by you know was not more making the lottery\nThe centerpiece of your retirement plan despite to lotteries current size right\nWhat do you know what is Martin going to zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon do hire the right person recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new zip recruiter finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies skins thousands of resumes then identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invites them to apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast that's why the recruiter is rated number one by employers in the U.S in just reading comes from hiring sites on trust pilot\nWith over one thousand reviews and right now our listeners can tries to recruiter for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon zip recruiter the smartest way to hire you want a suspicion see\nFour out of five companies say they find a qualified candidate on the strip recruiter site within just a single day again the free trial begins a recruiter dot com slash Gordon\nYes that's true it's a way way down um and yeah that that get an education part really plays a role and I'm abortions are actually falling as well so it's not just that um you know there are more abortions happening it's\nUm that there's actually a decline in sexual activity I'm In a rising birth control so it's um you know think including methods like you know having inter eater and divisive and things like that so it's you know there's also more methods of birth control that are available\nFor speaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Maria lasagna she's written a piece of more American women are having babies later and some are still conflicted about it as you mentioned a there was a question or a survey that looked at\nKind of the best way to get ahead in ... ... your professional life having babies earlier or later\nRight exactly and um there's you know obviously it's a very controversial topic and um you know you can't always control death and you know\nEvery woman's experience is very different but um yeah there have been sort of mixture thoughts on um you know if people should you know quote unquote should have children earlier or later in their career\nAnd you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women inside a woman who want to be a top executive should actually have children earlier about the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better\nUm and so there's kind of you know two schools of thought I'm not either battery children earlier when you get your self earlier in your career and then\nUm you know when they're a little bit older you can really you know and so to speak and and really extend your career\nOr you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having your baby when you're a little more established it's better um but it also so much depends on\nYou know what your company maternity policy it and all those kinds of things so um you know obviously it every individual decision\nMakes Maria marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill among you thirty minutes after the hour on this morning America First news\n\n\nUse eyeballs even hurricane will now considered an extremely dangerous near a category ... storm in the Eastern Pacific ...\nProbably expect the outer reaches of the tropical storm force winds are like laid off later tonight or early Tuesday Morning\nAnd that's a John ... at the national Hurricane Center Willis maximum sustained wins over one hundred fifty miles an hour when we've gone through elections and there is a key state now that's beginning early voting today and it's being watched by both Democrats and Republicans alike there are a number\nOf U.S House seats in racist being watched but two key races are regarded as tell tale about power both Republicans and Democrats may yield GOP governor Rick Scott is term limited but it's challenging democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson\nN.

Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last person to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president [noise] um you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do with it it has not happened [laughter] trying to Ninety two\nWhat is unusual for the president to shape things in quite a manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been kind of a difference in many respects to the president and if another example he's saying things about a blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy\nHobbies were his biggest corrupt up and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\nThat's what he said I'm a part of this is also laying the groundwork are to blame the [noise] uh if anything should go on the economy or fun\nI'm sure market [noise] and you know even though there's some speculation there about why he's doing this if you look at the ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people that are sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents that are not picked by the White House boat every few weeks on monetary policy\nDonald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's been doing this just to kind of a running\nPublic criticism of the central bank and you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the judge says presidents or criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else or as per usual when the president do something like this he started a discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent [noise]\nFor exactly right [noise] um [noise] people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is to end but President Trump is um probably elevating that debate and saying look unemployment rate slow\n[noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a black disappears and the economy because you don't want to have inflation but with the President Trump is saying here as well worth the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates [laughter] we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter who's pieces called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be catering to the president\nSo they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very ah difficult right now the most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decision to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case for a year from now let's say you're from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tells you you should do\nAnd so the question is on the coasts where you don't have as much conviction about the policy path to the president's criticisms again in your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously\nThe point that you identify as the other side which says look if markets begin the question of such credibility\nThen that's even worse and so it might actually from their back a little bit but the fed so far as saying we're going to ignore this or we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and if people criticize it you know then we'll deal\nMick Wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick to morose it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.
