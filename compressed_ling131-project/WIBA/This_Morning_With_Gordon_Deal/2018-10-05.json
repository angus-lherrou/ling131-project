advisors\nNo there's nothing small about your business they provide one on one partnership and reliable bill PCs with intel core processors to get business done\nPresident Trump's new trade deal with Canada and Mexico is nothing new operas new protections for us intellectual property along with data in digital assets\nIt's slightly improved American access to the Canadian dairy market and new provisions on autos could protect some us manufacturing jobs\nBut his trade experts scour the details of the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement they wonder why so much effort produced so little change so says Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman Rick how to use it\nI mean let's talk about what different um uh the uh there's a slight increase in the percent of the a Canadian dairy market that us farmers will have access to a they're going to be some new rules on 'em\nUsing um a Moor high cost labor in the production of cars if they want to pass\nBetween the three countries duty free without attach so that might protect some of\nThe American jobs but it's also going to raise the cost of cars and the one thing where I think Trump does deserve credit for improving upon the original NAFTA is there now a new provisions that protect intellectual property and data and digital assets which really were not part of the original NAFTA\nWhich went into effect in Nineteen Ninety four which\nWas before the Internet as we think of it today even existed show in the agreement has been updated just to take account of changes in technology so that's a good thing but guess what\nAll of those changes would have been in Trans Pacific partnership deal which also would have included Canada and Mexico which Trump pulled the United states that\nYou're just a Trump paid her and like the pedal fake news isn't it [laughter]\nNo it's not true ah I run something called the ... report card you're a finance a we're ... we're accepting that Trump's former John the economy on a monthly basis we currently give him a B\nFor his handling of the economy uh that's pretty good um and what it would take to get up to an essay or would probably be um better wage growth\nAnd better or exports which are two districts factors we look at but we give we are saying what tropic presiding over a stronger economy\nAh I I don't get into whether Trump deserves credit for that or not I usually say look the economy kind of does its own thing\nTrump but president either get credit or blame for it show\nHer how be doing okay on the economy um but some of the things she doing you have to say what they really were all the controversy and disturbing drawn of oh we're going to tear up the north American free trade agreement that might cause a recession apparently we're not we're just going to make some minor changes in color victory\nOr speak with Yahoo Finance columnist ... Newman his piece is called Trump's base strategy on trade rebranding how much of this bill might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different\n[laughter] well I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution or where he began earlier this year\nKind of like picking fights with everybody\nOr he tried to Europe or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum and United States that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico so as we progress through these development it does seem that that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts say look I'm we really don't have much that trade problem with Canada we really\nDon't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else they basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies um when you need their help to put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement a U.S MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nHere's a I mean we may not really no during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... we should first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries\nAnd that is not a given um if it turns out that Democrats take control the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Madison", "day": "05"}
