effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president and it's an avid watcher of stock in particular and we know that because he frequently cleaning in real time and he watches particularly shocking friend in the morning and then also I'm\nCarrying Hannity in the evening temp contracts and all the time to come over at the Fox channel until the general public notice it until ... and ... have found that as an active way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise\nDuring his tape it to the

counter messaging to him during the same program\nIs you know to be influenced by them\nWe can see if he ... directly after an ad\nUp on TALK on this happened when a group of workers with advertising I drink boxing fan in March you know ... and I came up that the president started talking about the issue to projecting that he had seen the ad\nAnd then took it on the other side here if you remember last year ... tire constantly and fight with the president and started an impeachment movement I'm kind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted fat and tweeted about it right away\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong viewership um during this administration viewership has a red and and so have the ad rates [laughter] and ah we've actually seen some ... ...\nEmail noted that not only the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wind but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategist also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president has expressed dislike for programs on on those two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those\nChannels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may be some type of advertising and and death flag it to him\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin ... from the group need to impeach about how he feels so he ... he just suspect that the president's watching a nosy can targeting with with like a little elbow and the ribs kind of
