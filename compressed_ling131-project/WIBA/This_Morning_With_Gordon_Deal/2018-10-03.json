contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing your\nPoint there's a lot of a concern and then some quarters consternation about the idea that companies uh you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that a lot more freedom\nTo swoop in and get involved in electoral politics have always at the lobby they've always got a lot of money in Washington state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and\nElections and certainly there is some corporate involvement on election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you're talking about interfering in elections with money you talked about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld show companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and the other way it's such an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party [noise] ah you know the Democratic Republican governors ah accent that basically support a direct getting\nGovernors one party or the other or a similar group church turn each channel on state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them

this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies have been in the U.S ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a\nCow and where and when they spend a and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that have gotten more so for example that used to publish report on the political activity and now they don't or their reports or watch a informative than I used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new companies already may be five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display the political spending reports that jumping I expect you'll see change as those companies should pay a million bucks it turns out that larger companies and come up in an index longer\nTend to do better at disclosing out when where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement chain date it was a mayor they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what the restrictions are on a on political spending in talking to me they said their position having changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like fiber one she for twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language that Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies\nThat say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they tell their trade associations not to use that upon each tore a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does that some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization the center for political accountability but then also a some a shareholder activists or shoulder advocates\nHave put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know after all they have much of the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances companies either she and how those votes go over time or just on their
