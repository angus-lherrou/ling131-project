civil war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nAnd let's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from near the man's bill reform matory\nYeah we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and\nIf I could I'd like to share a love story with you sure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a following ... but anyway uh my father died\nAnd three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out the you know to put two kids and just before daylight woke up my father was there became in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom suit up\nHer daughter kiss through and said honey everything's gonna be All right but it's beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and I was going\nTo share that with a sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional issue well aren't they Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in in my in the ... and ... accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing\nAnd they receive from the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that there's sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary\nScary it's not like that in real life it's going to join the Bronx I chose to go ahead\nGeorge how are you know Joe good I'm Brendan\nYeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and I've seen um [noise]\nYou know the um the question is do you think that there is some luminal undo channel of communication going on\nBetween to go see a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously there's the supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghost we have permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience a half the my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before and coast to coast [laughter] um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day\nUh at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you may be elaborate\nOn what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or who he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a city a ... before you had the experience maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay All right\nI'm while answer your second question then we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the the husband saying his wife and then the wife kind of says hey check behind the workbench and he finds it\nIs an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things she's giving you the motivation because I don't think you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation but he resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information at the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then you know wakes up cars finds a dog\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprint and\nUh the study is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio I'm In the car you can get it at

up\nWell so the either for Democrats to win control the Senate and that the Republicans have only a\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep a seats and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats the Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that has been increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a\nThere's a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin wanted her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the balance to be teaching the important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson I'd ever got other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights [laughter] very very uh a heavily funded from both sides\nAnd the wild card there all of a sudden is Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen as a leading the rescue effort or does it ultimately hurt him as people think the rescue effort hasn't been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold on to that when if they're going to have a chance answered is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way it any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha Mick Sally on the Republican side\nOf course the cinema on the Democratic side in a year of the woman going at it uh well Martha mix Sally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnchors the cinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if Democrats\nAre going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total one of those probably going to have the Arizona so those seem like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ... he's\nBeen an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's the great question I it's hard to know is is um [noise] he's going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voted suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities [laughter] those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance at a presidential election so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Madison", "day": "23"}
