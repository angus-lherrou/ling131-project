remember that I'm like there's a real tense situation going on with China which is a market as as a Mexico and Canada nearly and in terms of agricultural exports are [noise] definitely [noise] buyer of soybeans which has been kind of the root of a lot\nHeadache and the heartland here this years is trying to put on those tariffs a couple of months back\nSo she goes a long way towards like we said to remove some of the big question mark right in the north American market and then that is very important you know just the proximity Alexa\nSo much in the way of agricultural goods be exported directly across those borders in particular you know meat products so on but there's still a lot of question marks out there for the rest of the globe the my main Europe is there's another one they've been working on\nA man from you know China obviously is going to mean to be resolved and for the time being looks like it's getting more tense an outlet so\nTo speak with Wall Street journal reporter Jacob bungee he's written a piece titled us farmers welcome new North American trade pact I'm from a food safety standpoint what's new on that front\nWhere you've got here is not a a man massive change in the way that this is on but they modernize some of the language and and tried to standardize some of the practices across three different markets and as you can imagine this is\nA sensitive topic ah people not just\nHaving [laughter] why they have confidence in their own country's food safety assessments but also you know wanting the most certain key that the practices in Mexico and Canada are going to be up to snuff and the U.S and by and large to the the us has taken\nThe view that that these things are a reliable and then the other countries are depends on the product and and there's a range of things but\nThe last time this language was a really updated was something there twenty three years ago and so\nThere's been a lot of advancements in that time as you can imagine [laughter] uh the food industry here in the U.S some particular is taken out of bigger policing some of these things which shows you know it's only debate but\nThis is why one of the key things worked out here and to to do with the food safety front\n... I I I think there was somebody in your stories it's something along the lines that there seems to be momentum right now for the American farmer on the trade front is that this is that a widely held belief\nWell I think it depends who you ask and probably or how they're how their bank account to work in right now you know depending on on what type a cropper or livestock they produce and how much they've been hit by lower prices but uh [noise]\nA comment about momentum came from a a place where you know the farmers and farm sector this goes for the agricultural companies to they've been watching about a year's worth the headlines are and things have been going into a direction where there was more a question\nUh in terms of us and its relationship with his major trading partner is you know Mexico Canada the EU China and so on [noise]\nAnd ah so the reference the momentum there was a trade deal an updated thing that President Trump signed last week with South Korea [noise] ah which has a\nSignificant market and then in Asia for us agricultural and food exports [laughter] and uh\nThe announcements with Mexico came before that a few weeks time and now with Canada looking like they're going to shore up the NAFTA or\nOpen after there was and move forward with something and so that's the reference to momentum as men after you know ... quite a few months here on the certainty\nWhere this all is going there there are seeing some resolution to some of these things\n...
