a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't though\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of back up\nTo

that their machines um have to have their ... need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to

thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any paper at all\nAnd that's how we got the more we have today\nOr how about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah for a bill a bill has

it with a serious subject you're wire sexual assault victims not always willing to come forward the reasons are many here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what did the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report on a on a fault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people and go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system takes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right\nSo now you you send it out there on your Italian people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be read traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\nWell we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so are there is a deep amount of shame often\nYou know people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes either somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nI had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should
