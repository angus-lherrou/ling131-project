I think it's important for everybody to do is make sure that you\nCan I think sometimes the the the danger is we assume that the other side is somehow flawed and they're thinking and that's how I came to the conclusion whether you're far left far right middle left middle writers middle of the road always good to hear what other people are thinking about do you think do you think\nPolitically the or the protesters are still in effect right now and still chanting chanting against a justice Kavanaugh um do you think that's a good tactic for the Dems going into November\nNo no but but what are you going to do I mean how do you it's when you're out of power you get you know you these types of things that we saw with you know during the first couple of years of all\nBy buying right away you see what you know with the rise of the Tea Party and I'm Glad you brought that up a ... position you look at this crowd as opposed to the Tea Party who gathered in thousands police thrown area's cleaned up after every demonstration\nAnd the uh the uh legit or a racial slurs that were allegedly thrown out at a you know Nancy Pelosi and uh a couple of African American members of the Congress a debt that accusation was made a when they were walking through the crowd with a giant gab all I think I can like juveniles\nUm and and so many cell phones were check 'em a lot of people said never happened nobody screamed any racial epithets at a\nUm I forget who it was made the accusation but again it's just they're allowed to do that yeah the politician joins oh dude I said this is terrible you know I Want to kill our children yeah but when their hands are Republicans by the threats are real we have the recordings where you have the uh the letters that are male and the video of it I'll be heading sent to the wife of a politician I\nReally believe this time around the block I Hope this waste Republicans up because the Democrats are in Burnet download until November a sex\nAnd what we please keep your eye on it and and I please stop allowing anybody to say well the Republicans don't want to say no we're not we don't behave this way we don't get to do this because the fourth estate goes back to doing their job and say why and how long you have allies and and my uh Chris Wallace a last Sunday my God\nOr the ... the demonstrations the yelling the harassment the screaming the following a the needed ... police escorts he didn't mention a word and he talked to a Republican senators Lindsey Graham and a leader McConnell\nAre talked about the anger talked about the emotion and the rhetoric and the the ease\nA and talk to the Democratic senator not worried about the insanity taking place I mean that that\nReally a disappointing moment with me and Chris Wallace of cause I the guys are smart\nGood journalists and he's an excellent moderator he's a great interviewer and and I that that respects still remains but by he really let his vice grip and things are now\nDo you think that one one side of the debate do hold for like a uh the the the kind of the ... the position of of dangerous or more extra I mean\nI you you hear stories like there's this guy in Florida who was who's been arrested for threatening congressmen and at that refused to they if they didn't confirm Kavanaugh I feel like there's there's these on the fringes of the French there on both sides and I don't even know what to call my dad\nBut but but our French any are you talking about this lunatic kid dead in Charlottesville\nUm you know who ran down to you know white supremacy more on living in the basement needs to show up and and hopefully get life in prison\nBut the fact is you got people willing to shoot at the Republicans and they show up with a list of Republican names in their pocket that's very different thing you know obviously there's threats out there but don't it's not the same the industry is not the same and the Republicans were not be allowed to get away with this via the fourth estate I'm\nThere would be called out for this every day and now the press stands as all these are legit protesters wonderful people like ...\n... they're harassing people that they're going they're ripping up science and trying to rip open the door to the Supreme Court it would be funny if it wasn't so tragic and this is our republic right now and I know you don't agree with me but that the Republicans do not act like\nThis but I I Would say Google what's his name um he's from winter haven Florida just was a ... ... it it doesn't always I I'm not saying it's ... it's it's so I think it's so wrong but James Patrick was the guy's name is it so wrong and so common now on both sides debate I don't\nI don't know that I could say oh yeah the left is is is far more dangerous than than the writer or anything because I think that there are certain people that are just they're just so I don't know what it is but there do you ...\nDo you think a democratic nominee or politician who is under scrutiny in front of a I got I've never seen that done by the Judiciary Committee\nOr if you have a a woman a nominee for the court like a Kagan and so the my or\nA at all and said yeah they left in ... left wing radicals but they're you know they base it on their decisions you know I I don't agree with their decisions or opinions\nBut the fact is a Lindsey Graham's outrage was absolutely well placed to be angry as he was a because we don't do this to a democratic nominees we wouldn't get away with it and the president calls out on a time and time again I just ... feet the whole

Angela Merkel for making a deal a side deal at the G twenty with the Russians\nHave you forgot that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians ended it was Angela Merkel of made a side deal with them for natural gas and it was Donald Trump that could not believe it and called her out on it and suggested that she couldn't have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G\nTwenty the G. eight the G Fifteen but the G whatever\nTrump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump Trump\nRussia collusion story had been discredited thoroughly Trump has not been a Russian puppet quite the contrary but you wouldn't be able to convince nic Robertson up that\nModel they got these ideas in their head trumping and Russia's got together they stole the election remember Hillary Trump as a Russian storage Trump has money because the Russians sought to what Trump falls Russia because of that Trump therefore soft on Russia\nNow Nikki Haley is leaving and that means nobody's left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death as a total one hundred percent front to back top to bottom crock folks\nGuarantee our allies are probably happiness you Nikki Haley go because she is tough and she is pro America she believes in America first just like Trump does not to the expense or at the expense of our allies you want somebody brought

nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face\nAre still that's coming up as the program unfolds\nBack however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up and get we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have no limits\nOn how low they will go on how the brave perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it uh they don't do it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I thought [noise]\nBut they don't for folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy discussion or acknowledgement\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded this part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the capital hearings everything that we are up against the abs since ... presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had on the evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen

terrible and then what's gonna unless the election people are going to say it's not going to stop we can't allow the Democrats back in it\nIsn't going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose this is

close enough attention to know who the names being bandied about might be\nBut they're going to do it on principle they're gonna do it because they think it'll be a political advantage headed in the

I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is out a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds Obama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen\nHillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\n\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy and and we and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd\nBe they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that true\nWas turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanting to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\n\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this then I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nA house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our body is preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in\nNumbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was one about away Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump's forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points\nBack the Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor California is is closer than is running its Gavin Newsom that anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think Washington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think\nWe haven't seen the melt down that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach Kavanaugh and Trump and if that doesn't happen\nI don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nAnd very

Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from political [noise] just just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either family already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nSo political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or a new wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats you and me and for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nTwo hundred and nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's for this ... this is [noise] and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people who are watching it live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American\nVoters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans\nThat they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide disgust with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nHas a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election\nNight to those who sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right\nWell as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that it's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what\nWas I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and\nAnd uh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU cops\nAre running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know officer you know our\nGoverning body is separating the two parents that are born or an eye on them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this so well\nAll the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house and she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate and just better than everybody that got an is why\nThis guy has more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend that while telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget\nIs attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ... folks by reputation\n... go get a picture of the guy who put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here in pushing them little camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says John Tower\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John Powell basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo and drivers right why anyway she search it happened in a cab\nThat John Powell tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax it you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was session he was in general and the army at the time and the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car than\nScreech to a halt in front of our corners and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun but I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um but but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more bite we got Times
