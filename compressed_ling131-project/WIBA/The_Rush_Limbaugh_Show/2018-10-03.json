B.\nI. special agent her best friend for life\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement the ABC\nI have never had an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I'd Rachel Mitchell if I have time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives\nThat if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get\nPast this or through this with out\nAny any challenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look\nI'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a\nVoice capabilities voice talents excuse me again art that I may have gotten it out there that time\nWe'll see are a specialty of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in Hollywood decided to post\nOn Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on\nMercilessly so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but\nHere is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... on the body and personal ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... even ...\nI'll talk about an attack Barnes okay I'm In my hand I found out about ... per se [noise]\nHow 'bout that her as far as ... ...

do FX and she succeeded\nWith it and it's because of that but I think I don't know no matter what has learned about her and how much she has lived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter]\nCould blow this woman out of a water that's what I had no one else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there either noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel literal asked her about subject a and her answer it and you read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph your minutes why she asked him this\nWhy why do you what this is not what this is about Canada why are you asking her details chicken farm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFord has a best

Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where am I got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWide cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do it got Trump Arabic claim he's mocking ball the forty wasn't mocking or what I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh\nMy God this is on so I don't know why the president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not\nChristine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate last week was not the time to do it so Trump joys of course I find a compelling I find her very credible\nWill now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible as all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is probably the out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhat an I'd been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise orbit differences the prevailing Haitians she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times has been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nIs not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not city in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often do you say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bats yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a ... storage\nTrump was Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names and serve big fat zilch zero is not a sudden now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump and he got rich from his dad\nBottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience just don't remember the Clinton\nYears in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones\nYou never know what you do when you're grabbing gotta go to ... like what you're going to come up with what you're gonna you're gonna come up by women like New Hampshire gray the president\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford and that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said\nCarville most of you are too young to remember this so not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back\nThis was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nWhat we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting candidate on caster they did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies\nParticularly\nCash that you know no would you like and on corroborate would charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're okay if a rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie do not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protesters there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told the story

nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've\nGot an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that\nTrump will treat something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing to do with looking at it than we are looking at it than moving to the right to oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans having Trump has Trump has a stab wished\n\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nThey just simply pushy she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\n\nRoche ... women\nNo there should we do well yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and I've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party is in ... and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in

V. chip off on my heart radio these\nThese ... Rush Limbaugh show and keep listening for Mickey McKenna had three all news talk Thirteen and tell you why do why be a dot com [noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh the network books to your ear is the IRS the James with them to the gym and guarantee quotes from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution or the river\nBed which is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that they are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this ... ... well the me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was\nTaught to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nInsult people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\n[noise] sick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has been constructed\nTo push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is a rate every black convict is in is\n\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise] the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of\nThese complaints Democrat Party he's happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not now Sarah Sanders the White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nAnd here it is that there's this they didn't even ... Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump termed an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all\nAbout do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me by the way they bowed miserable you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony and it's and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have the gun ads to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little Shay and for some of these people to hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah it's\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the cabinet firings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN ... a couple of months ago saying that a guy\nEighth or because he asked her for her phone number can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Katherine my Ken and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr do you\nEver um a year right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine it\nHooked on it if not better right by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women\nOn across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move

team coverage on news talk Thirteen can tell you why ... says the days of lower\nA it has been since Trump was inaugurated even during the transition it's been a series of steps or efforts to get rid of Donald Trump to overthrow the election results of two thousand sixteen and I think Christine balls the Ford\nIs an element of that whole movement or that\nWhole desire the Democrat Party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the F. B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\n\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump\nWouldn't sit there and let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's\nJust many screwed it mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after\nThe Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger\nJosh Hawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these three Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would Cape and ... Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states there's hell to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\n[noise] but if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line\nWrites that a reader of theirs noted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic you created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why this sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSo\nThe charge here and try no tried served difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\n\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back just saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nIn her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specify\nIt's summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first forge testimony the assault occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that presidents should alert or your phones that are ... yeah I forgot to warn people about this to Eighteen today there is an emergency warning system test\nIt just happened to my watch started going crazy and I'm going to lead the test is just a task it's not an Amber Alert it's just a test that if if global warming had been cited or or or um sea levels had risen and there would be this massive
