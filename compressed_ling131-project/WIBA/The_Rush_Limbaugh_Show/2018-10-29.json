I mean I I I see that you know pretty universally ... politically is you know\nDon't you tell the rat brains will come after you operate\nIn the center and I think that's partially why when when uh when there's bad actors were so very personally disconnected because they are not reflective of us they are not reflective of of R D ideals liberal or conservative is\nA conservative they are not reflective anything that we stand for I think for a lot of us when it happened and we hear people pointing fingers saying oh that's your guy that's your guy that was the truth is no ... they are they are not similar to the rest of us so\nWell I I Would also say the psychopaths who uh the uh took so many lives over the weekend and the guy who frightened so many people during the last week um yeah I don't I don't think it's fair to blame a Donald Trump for this and I'm certainly not going to return fire and say you know what you didn't create the cycle\nSo let's leave it at that and perhaps\nI Would say I would say were warning something like this could happen though is is I was trying to tell the\nDemocrats have drugs in injury I said listen shut up for a while some point they stopped that everything's bad about Trump and yet you look at the uh\nAgain MSNBC and I said at the all the other networks as well they hate this guy and they've been spewing I Believe to be a a stream of hatred towards this cat that on deserved and I say cat though about our present I'm Sorry a President Trump is taking a lot of incoming he's not desserts far as I'm concerned so it's a and I know you disagree\nWith that you're going to ditch you got to be ready to be served sometimes\nAll right that's a fair and up and the the ... the looking and looking at look at these people in the back [laughter] I Would pay to I got to go to one of his rallies do come on you mean you're going to report live for the Colorado River why from the drummer hey we're being thrown out wait wait wait we're the good guys were the good guys sorry leave us alone go way\nUp do what did you do to the studio today I Know what happened to the show I don't know I don't know where do we got to ask this radio show in the world the fastest way to do in the world\nAnd um we should dominate all media we are the ... [laughter]\nI should take a break down maybe call if we got that Russian showing coming up next and we got picking McKenna show three o'clock a showing you collectively both thank the Boston Red Sox today or feeding them on ... a Los Angeles Dodgers filth that and isn't it poetic Machado get the ...\nIt's out of the game Oh nice gonna do a better guy\nA mist which I Do I have a very immature to wear praised you suck it and you know you have a good day got to take a break my maturity this mix of meeting is now officially over was feed 'em or a gang this has been the kind of ratio that's the one and only sharp people knew was talked Thirteen ten WNBA seat um our gang\nBecause what it shows is that whenever there is any kind of violence\nAny kind of uprising any kind of ... the first instinct as a drive by\nMedia has\nAnd I when I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up when did then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on substantive grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the falls into political party\nOr it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do anything they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger\nAnd if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whenever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by media is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we\nEnded up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\n\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what\nIf I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is my your men to pay attention to it it is by your man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now you would think this is going to affect the midterm\nElections Democrats and maybe I gotta I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going you pretend to ratchet these two\nThings up to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault him this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can\nTell you right now I mean a ... do not know it from a\n... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up of being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed they're fed up with their country being blamed and so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences for about\nProtesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on on why they create a lie\nAbout the shooter in that in that in my ... my ground good order first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... whatever they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now\nIt it it it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now is because it is\nNobody believes what'd you say\nYou're saying it's so obviously politically\nWhy were uniform passenger electric cars in October I must tell him another tier funeral I Will donate twenty dollars to double the world's population plus you know forty dollar

it you see the way this works is [noise]\nThirty six year old allegation can be banned for which there is no evidence Adam for which force opposing witnesses camp in place themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh exposed to sit\nBack and just take he's just she those are the old rules of Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump busy wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll liked it and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry while he was smeared\nAnd while his family was threatened them why his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\n\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up first today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rush pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI to tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down eight to one\nThing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could have been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control is not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop it\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor that change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that kept but other than that you got oh freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] ah yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except it needs to look up to that but but but but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the court and joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's for air force one is part for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws [noise] by the way I Need it tells you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns\nThis guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is\nTrump being responsible for this and that in all the other things\n[noise] anti Semitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nWorst part is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling them silent crime it's why

that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable way they have excuses you know we can look their way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was Farrakhan standing right next to him all of the Aretha Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him and many drive by news organizations crop Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but\nIt's this is the point we have a two tiered justice system\nAnd we clearly have a two tiered political system we have criminalized\nRight wing or conservative Republican politics and policy and at the same time exempted\nFrom any criticism or criminality um most of

I'm a big in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nWhen they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't put it I said that they were I mean because when I\nSay that yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're willing they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [laughter]\nWell one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how\nA liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is this it it it it it's it's the Jewish state\nAnd yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's it's anti the religion and it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is a religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out no way that I it's a disclaimer I'm Jewish\nBut I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagree with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion that's big I mean the the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian too\nUm I don't see them as necessarily being\nSued Islam\nBut I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nThis that's exactly right I was just wondering Mrs all headed\nThis is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are the trend is towards atheism and no God\nOr at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's any Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this has been in Pittsburgh than it does it\nAdd to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I mean it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I I think that that these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much a re July presents racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the Dr ... and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second events happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nWas the to the people that politicized\nThe thing\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left to people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have I have an entirely different pitch why did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people\nIn fact I think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThe traditional norms of civility they do another Trump is a reactionary he's reacting to the way they treat him\nYeah there may be\nBlamed to go around on both sides here but for the media to totally claim they've got nothing to do with this is absurd now here's Matthew Dowd this guy formally and George W.\nBush Republican now he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Mathis\nOh yes he says oh Trump's fault all of this was Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact you they they damn well one of the things they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do\nThe same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and\nThe Mary Jordan the Washington\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of\nHow that plays games I was a murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is\nResponsible for fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say there's no well we didn't see that map you doubt but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to murder\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what they're actually saying then they pulled back and deny it\nBecause we're coming right back\nTime for broadcasters to get the

expectation lose any day that\nYou tune in you get more than you were expecting in here is Brian in Chesapeake, Virginia Hi\nHi rash what a great honor and privilege as it is to speak with you today\nThank you sir I'm very much I I just wanted to make a couple additional observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yeah now I\nI normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they set this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFerret contour my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this when our wedding and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive may never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you were if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a guy a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where's it it's absurd where where's it headed\nYet my own thought as people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the lapses you'll you we we have gun free zones and schools now you can't put guns in there be only be able to get hit with guns or the bad guys who people up [noise]\nUm the ... that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left is the problem so the presence of guns mean [noise]\nThere'll be [noise]\nAs they might grab audio soundbite number was go ahead and play on a [noise] this was\nFrom last friday toward me I was in the last half hour and a program or maybe the last hour I'm not sure which um and that that was the day that we had a we've learned about the pipe bomber Caesar say are getting his perfectly uh uh [noise]\nBumper sticker van and and all that but I drive by very very angry at me for pointing out that\nEverything and that man was symmetrical you get in shape and none of it was fated drive by very angry at me for the fact that is a plate and go get somebody to play that one first just to illustrate\nA [noise] I I don't think these people understand the extent to which they have a damaged their own credibility\nAt what we we simply don't accept what they say anymore without questioning and they do not get that I think they insist that we accept what they say without question and they lost that that's that's one of the\nSomewhat say sad things that's happened but but there's this constant doubt so here we have a montage of MSNBC yours NBC here is CNN ours and others\nApoplectic that I dared make any observation about the stickers on Cesar ... van\nRush Limbaugh this afternoon talking about how the stickers were to symmetrical on the band\nRush Limbaugh is casting doubt on the suspect than\nRush Limbaugh say something like you know what those stickers don't look said it enough\nI don't understand why Rush Limbaugh would say something like that I'm Amazed to hear people talking about this is a false flag operation I'm

is\nUh to notice that every one of those bumper sticker or whatever they weren't the cows\nAre perfectly symmetric way place that it it may or in the windows of the guys man [noise]\nThey might ah here is what I was a case called my final summation that happened on friday about why we're suspicious of the drive by media and the left in general they have\nMade me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results two thousand sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the Trump\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just ...\nBeside themselves that everything they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked so given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nI'm not going to believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be as\nEvery day for two years New York times CNN intelligence community resources and former American intelligence officials tell the New York times ... blah blah blah blah blah blah every day sometimes many times a day for a year\nTwo years stuff's\nMade up out of whole cloth news stories literally made up\nAll to advance advance the agenda of essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans moderates independents never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise] don't\nHave to plan it\nAnd told everybody that the American people are tired at Trump and
