they pressured her\nTo revisit her statement the wall Street Journal had the story or has the story today\n\nThis was witness tampering this was this was asking a witness to lie\nSo as to buttress the story told by Dr ... Ford and the pressure came from a former FBI agent again who's one of the beach buddies\nOf Dr Ford's if this is a witness tampering and somebody needs to tell me what it is\nCharles Grassley was on Fox by the grass me as I mentioned at the end of the yesterday's program Grassley has been a buyers' sunk thing has really\nSet him off\nI Would think that it would have happened ... years and years and years ago but whatever something has really set him off now\nHe's going after the press accusing them face to face of out right by us he's accusing the Democrats are being insincere\nDoing great harm to the Senate want a grasp on these points is ... and John Cornyn two if we're going to get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof what are we doing for every future nominated comes before this committee\nIf the new standard is is it all the nominee has to be is accused of something and that kills the nomination then where\nAre we headed we're headed exactly where the Democrats want\n\nJust to refresh remembered lousy foreign and leaving Kaiser were were\n... some ... some say best friends at the time of the alleged attack by Capitol\nWhen Kaiser's denial was brought up during the hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee balls e Ford attempted to just credits her by\nSaying that what she's got health problems can't ...\nI don't know but she was not well I I felt really bad and for her\nTurns out that we won Kaiser is a former pro golfer she does have back problems but not mental health issues ... Monica McLean again ... lifelong best friend and the woman boldly Ford allegedly coach prior to taking a polygraph test\nIs Monica Monica McLean is all over this story we only learned her name in the past week or so\n\nAnd according to reports Monica ... plan was it bowls the Ford side and the hearing room before she ... she was I have now seeing photos anyway Grassley said on Fox and friends this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were leaned on by allies of ball before it as well not just leaving Kaiser\nOther witnesses were Leno that means every senator has seen that every senator just read the report has seen this\nAnd it apparently isn't changing any votes of the vote was fifty one to forty nine mansion flight and\nCollins all voting yes but the final vote cannot happen\nBy Senate rule\nFor forty two pm eastern time tomorrow\nBe thirty hours after this vote was taken now I Want to say I'm\nNot surprised by Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the boat now gonna not going to change I mean if we have in the culture about we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comment and it's not just on social media but so the officers that so many Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used\nTheir entire families are being threatened their grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous\nIt is never ending the funds don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in his ... it is viable and it is evil and it's not just flake\nAnd Collins and Manchin it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain professional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for Kavanaugh in is it's not technically a vote for cabin odds of vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the role of I'm always says that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flight today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term\nOr the easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and receive the praise of the mob and received the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious slave he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine\nI Can't describe for you you might have an idea you're probably know the things that are being sent to these people the for rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society\n\nIt's unhinged much of it is is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute now the mainstream of the Democrat Party\nThe protestors are paid their signs are all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ... by them\nBut if you have an if you believe them they can honor view\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be not the thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning if for intention is to vote no down the road if\nYou're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up and used and rely on I think\nWe're we're in brand new territory here for a number of reasons I don't think you can say that just because\nSusan Collins voted yes this morning means and guarantees she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then why make a statement at three o'clock why why make some ... wife three o'clock and why make some statement\nYou know I Try to keep my ego out of this as much as I can tell when I see somebody is going to make a statement at three o'clock first thing I realize is I'm not going to be here to comment on it\n\nAnd I wonder if I'm the only one that notices that or if the person making the statement and wide I it's it's a it's a curious thing it could just wellbeing that or she wants a lot of attention for what she is going to say\nBut as of right now they've they've both been ...\nNot sucking up ... accusing me of sucking up I'm not I I I I Know that kind of threat to these people are getting\nSusan Collins in fact I'll tell you the Susan Collins has been assured by people that if she votes no she can forget ever being re elected to the Senate from Maine by the Republican Party there\nSure I can get you a speaking gig if you don't mind performing for Chinese businessman who speaks no

the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and its designs is founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration to do it in the ... white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to him he'd been honest about what transforming America man so what did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become

study that has been taking\nA [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the ground is just what you see [noise] even though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify\nA some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would they held can that be 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in

reliant people people that do not need\nDo not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine\nAs they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male

course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\n\nNot

the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nA heating and those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring wheeling Kaiser to change your test with those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard even though that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her Senate and

Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... ... ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond the beyond the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not is it is the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out\nA\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nNo it's not about to come out that's the whole point you\nKnow it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead Lynn Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls e foreign witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's going to change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it ABC CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate about\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\n... well the question is why wouldn't republic groups make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy it may revert to a a [noise]\nIt's in the FBI report the Republicans I think that Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report\nThey discovered I'd like to my to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about no ...\nNo they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning it\nOK okay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense you were sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the ... the foreign side is willing to commit\nPerjury ... born perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories\nWhich then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not showing up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... the reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate no it doesn't matter it's about the seriousness of the charge is not about the nature of the\nNew Rochelle Mickey I met were\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one random safe you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves\nThe craftsmanship up their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured parts art\nPart furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

month\nDoes anybody think that would fly there is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say bad about women senators are women witnesses or any of us sort but here's Jennifer Ruben and by using this this this analogy these\nRepublican senators behaving is if it's their time of the month is that not acknowledging that there is such a thing as their time with among\n\nSo who is it here that's being

Lisa Murkowski was a definite no on Kavanaugh\nAnd in announcing her definite no she said he is just not the right man on the Supreme Court right now just not the right man\n\nSo Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that our minds now made up\n\nThe wing is a Reuters story and it says essentially Murkowski has not made a final decision\nYou could have fooled me it sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read it Brett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate\nRight now\nNow she's saying it's not her final decision something is happening in that regard [noise] here Kimberly ... tweets again the first one here well they're they're both right on the money just to be clear yeah I'm trying to apple five days\nI'm I'm trying to make sure more people hear about these tweets and then we'll see them yeah absolutely it's worth it\nCan release dry so Wall Street journal columnist editorial page editor and writer just to be clear on what Lisa Murkowski voted for today Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted to legitimize and sign off on\nThe most this pick a boat tactics ever in the Supreme Court nomination Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nVoted today just stand with Diane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or doing [noise]\nAnother interesting thing had another new developers here but hang on just second there's a second ... from Kimberly stressful\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block\nWhich puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money legitimizing and signing off on the most is that ... tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dashed city and and a number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment and then leaving\nThe court if he has not confirmed accord stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of a leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be in unison with me too movement [noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos were\nTaken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture on standby 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a pain to look on her face Feinstein that looks like\nShe is\nBut on the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand that she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nAn aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those would be watching on the dental camp do you see the pain the expression on the face of Murkowski\nAnd the ... of in hand\nSeriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of diet for now\nWe'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but uh what are you watching on the digital camera to be able to see these that's that close up as the same shot\nJust to close up of the previously televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable she not\nMeans it's been really pained look on her face and\nIt it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back or one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic under load I certainly what's the old saw\nIt's not for us to criticize who loves who and why\n[noise] so uh yeah it can be a lot ... lovers quarrel we don't know what I've got to get these photos up the cocoa unless cocoa confined to the shore cocoa couldn't find them and self or it may beat me the punch now the other [noise] breaking story [noise] that's not a breaking\nYeah well you know it's that was there and resistance is Sarah ... is is there a way to get the gotcha back on

minute the stroke of a saint pick what could go away\nWell if the stroke or the pen can but animal are in place for this day\nOh oh you mean Trump could cancel and war as pay back the Murkowski for going against capital Yes sir it wouldn't do it\nOh okay I'm\nToo many people be hurt too many people get hurt by\nYour right but that that means a lot for her and her state so I don't know uh the other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump\nBut it would most likely include cabinet or what does that did it for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached is well\nAbsolutely sir\nNo no no that they wouldn't buy that much off a bit get rid of cabin on getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty\nI in fact I think my guess is that they would go after capital first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nA fresh and everybody's minds go after him on her juror rainy and sexual harassment\nNot I mean serious serious things for\nWhich a conviction could ruined his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital and they add all the other things\nOn Trump this is my guest that they would go after Kavanaugh first but that that that Gorsuch state would leave alone ... courses to\nShift the balance of the court cabin on does\nNo word from a national keep our own kids safe campaign about the

believe that the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show all allegations are important\nWe believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are important we believe that all Chuck

so uh hey what a week or ... it's been a what a what a few weeks it's been\nA [noise] it is your southward friend Bryan mud in for the great one Markel of him and by the way because there's always one\nThis is not the place to share your your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations if people are nothing by now you go directly to the FBI and you demand an investigation and then be sure to look over their shoulder and tell them how they can conducted all throughout the course of that investigation\nBut the the absurdity of the situation is that Chuck Schumer lifestyle my uh was joining you couple of Tuesday's ago hadn't made that statement earlier in the day\nBefore we even had the hearing last Thursday well I Believe her and that's what this really what's all about\nThat's what this all really was all about\nDon Brett Kavanaugh out about the Supreme Court out about Christine forward\nIt's about what kind of country we are going to be what can the country or this would end up\nRepresenting in a world in which someone as distinguished as incredible\nAnd you know otherwise clean as Brett Kavanaugh if he can be taken out of the highest levels of justice where alls corrode the moment that somebody comes out of left field with an allegation actually sure to a very personal story with you and I received stories from across the country and believable responded to a to all of you\nWho who share their stories about extortion about threats about people that had done bad things to you and here's the the good news and the bad news\nThe good news and the bad news of this situation is that we're not screw it in this country the bad news is we're two votes away today from being screwed in this country so it's a big time wake up call and a reminder reminder about several things for example\nIt's a reminder right now that if you are in Chicago and you're a cubs fan and you're a leftist wow it must suck to be you right now that's really stuck to be in fact if I were you I won't even joked about what's the point what's the point you know the same\nBut it's also a reminder that we are right and then that's fine line that fine line and I got a message for you if you are familiar with my work then you have hurt me talk about the premise and the premise is what I operate off of I Will never embraced the false\nOne and if you build anything on a false premise anything built upon it is indeed itself going to fail for example when you are Chuck Schumer and you say hey you know what I Believe her you have no evidence you have no testimony of nothing believe her that's a false\nPremise and guess what you'll lose but we all do so that's the the first the most important thing the second is that there are two sides to stories in one side effects\nNow here the facts and it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy last Thursday and bless her heart\nSusan Collins who delivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying at any point today\nOne that oh my God Chuck Grassley who's left who spry spunky and Susan Collins Susan Collins this afternoon\nDelivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver who the heck happened a year at a at a lot of interesting the interesting things going on\nBut in the context that there are two sides to stores and one set of facts that Thursday you have so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who was unbelievable today\nWho said that you know when she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and uh you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people yeah you know they both were known and we're not no day we're not going to be right somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available is Christine for the film out people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're to ban same to the final votes tomorrow and Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nThat she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world but the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation offer\nBut as long as I have an opportunity to do so which she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said it's wrong\nThat's wrong and it's important now when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine Ford they are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an act of evil but there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she isn't possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nAbsolutely are held accountable for murder right why why she tried to do to break out and I am one hundred percent certain\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh machine not trying to effectively ruined that man's life\nHis family's life how evil do you have to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did and it's important\nOnce again and we don't just white off because breakdown is going to make it through this thing and ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we end up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in ... I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know\nNot and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on a ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise\nThen we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way [laughter]\nDo what they did coming out of that\nFour percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know ...\nIt didn't change public opinion at all not at all now is interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine forwards allegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw public sentiment shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today I was kind of interesting by a forty six to forty five margin Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed now they're two lessons to be learned\nIn this entire process on this information to first as public opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the oh the nonsense for sport it gets to Christine for two gang raping\nWhatever public opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen here\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is like a graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has\nTo do with persuading people politically how do you do it well the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically probably the loudest people in your life that oppose you\nWrite how does that work out for you and let me ask you\nFor the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you just get angry do you think they're one of the\nFolks just poured that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they are in our lives and our universe\nWants to be open minded first\nComing up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded\nAnd how not to bend your head against the wall and [noise] just become really unhappy [noise] I Am Brian mud\nThe gray one more global\nListen to what David asked for Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done have it's absolutely right I truly love my ex chair and I know you will to trust me why don't you feel how much support the ex chair provide\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ... chairs on sale now for a one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now\nThat's ...
