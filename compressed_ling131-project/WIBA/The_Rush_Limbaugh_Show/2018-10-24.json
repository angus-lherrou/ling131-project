Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and co founder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming\nIt would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one is seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five states twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise] so all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising all her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it [noise] [noise] [noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sends an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have it there was just this morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with just some of the things I get some of that is by the way it legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that since I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passionately this guy who is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known\nAs he looks at things he's he is an absolute red wave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing\nTrends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert in any of these trends are there with actual prediction until now\nHere's another story this from Bloomberg News holds could be missing a Republican surge\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters now that the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive by showing everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys gonna miss late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg says but it could it could it could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go either ... what is this decision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months\nYou name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct so they still have that reputation as all of a sudden it could be really\nReally close much closer than we ever ever new it's a cycle and you can

opening George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to obtain now quite being there were never any country these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something this whoa it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that\nWay it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWould it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat\nIn cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to some men to it like think Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously have set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose [noise]\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clintons playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folks started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... top it cause I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign in two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense the garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste their was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time Tony I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami for someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this was a philosophy that I have stalled for four years on this program asking people to never forget there\nNo coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary or Obama and so forth\nUh if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody's gonna he can still move the needle\nIt is working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the what was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to actually store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth from I Would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but I\nI have for everything you've done in my family me I Can't help but I

Republicans always ... in the media Republicans pounds Democrats David but Republicans ... ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes the dissent this statement that the Andrew Gillum\nHas repeatedly lied about taking free gift and trips from lobbyists to feel lie about these gifts and trips and lobbyists on national TV what else\nIs he lying about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents are short and me was neither a target or a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly giving vague answers to questions about who pay for the New York city trip is avoidance of a direct answer became pronounced during Sunday debate on CNN with the sensors\nAnd give them just ... and you pay for the handle the tickets now a lot of people want is a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nGuy won't tell the truth about is the big ... up\nI think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change his rock like this because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nIn too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks\nAnd uh and the other thing is willingly a desirous of seeking them and it's a [noise] in in this in this era\nWhere everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday showed that Andrew Gillum is headed to Santa fifty two to forty six among the light lay boaters\nAnd he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence and it's the third such poll in about a week ten days just show Gillum with this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so ... is a character he is a person with clouds of suspicion that are hanging all over\nHim in addition to that he is a hard left wing activists tack brewery first to Florida as his collecting he looks at things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leads the inequality an unfairness\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national income these these kinds of things that\nIf ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is ... is a lot of people may not know much about Ron's defenses so let me step in here and tell\nThose of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is ... and the Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat in order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family his wife or is is all in for this has got a young kid\nIs just the epitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\nNow on TV I think it was this morning he was on on Fox and he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum he\nPointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch him for breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled them of the young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of clout or investigation ever since he wants to Florida to be a sanctuary state\n[noise] he wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic\nAmerican socialist who believes America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault\nBecause we've all been stolen too many and too much of the world's resources and William hoard it at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWe have stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there is nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all out David now and the guy is a classic throwback he is\nA walking talking Iraq Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nIf you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum is not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over this country and in many places they are finding the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise]\nI'll tell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third team in her Senate race she voted against Kavanaugh and then thought she'd be able to recover some Republicans that got mad at her but she has blown that sky high\nShe's just missed judge things terribly I the details are coming up I don't want to get their sidetracked here the point is\nThat the Democrats are nominating waves eyes socialists\nAnd and and people have problems with America all over this country people who think America is flawed that there's no such thing as American exceptionalism or greatness and people think that our our unfairly biased and don't know the truth\nOf all the pain and suffering that America has inflicted on many of its own people\nMars some Sally Martha McSally running an Arizona she's got an arm's length of accomplishments\nThat would be the envy of\nAnybody and she she's being compared to this nasty bias sexual socialist is having to run
