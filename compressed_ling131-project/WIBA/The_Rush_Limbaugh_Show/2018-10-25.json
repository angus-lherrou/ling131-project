before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to CNN and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter they interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know why we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God alive Phil Donahue yes it is all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be he started preaching about the accidents have his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's what difference it made for me and if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically an unfair and that\nWas to want to other people in the world\nAs though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominance influence\nAnd to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't they were the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in because of our guilt\nAnd he says uh you know ... they're marching nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in a caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nBut it isn't\nTo me is how likely is it how could mail multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd haven't shown what miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and the thing that actually the vaccine that that's not that's not common sense I mean I can see how that can\nJust sort of the De Niro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before true see and then it got there and Clinton and so forth\nA there's a ... filled out we're both in that they had like four or five of them shows up all of that same time we're out of you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller hits you what I was going to one of the Congress and I was going to the fact that there wasn't enough postage on at the post office he even accept it\nUm the thing is these these were these were oversized packages that you're not taking them and and paying for them you know it had enough weight and paid in profits properly\nUm your you'd have to the post office box right off the ... don't even have enough wind whipping oversized package\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that at some of them actually did show up at the residents\nSo you're going to have the fat\nOkay what what are you suggesting that what are you suggesting here but\nI got pregnant I'm Sorry that I just I mean you know workers are trained to look for the Cuban looking packages cheesy if you're a joke I mean it looks like a joke even if I can see that there's something in there and if you look at the very draft you don't you think that after going through it\nNow wait a minute see this I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought this up I I wouldn't know I haven't been\nTrained I don't work the post office so I haven't been trained but I I've looked at these things and knowing after the fact that they're that they're what they are yeah they look odd but if I worked at a postal distribution center stuff was going through it or I might notice the postage\nIncorrect and so forth but that one does strike me as a bomb in there [noise]\nI caught Mrs crane to
