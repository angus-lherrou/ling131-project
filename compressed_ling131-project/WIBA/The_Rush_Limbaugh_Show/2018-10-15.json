back to focus on us now Jim Messina\nThe Obama campaign very disappointed that she would try to steal the news cycle this close to the election\nAnd not that he says they have to win the house and Senate to\nSave America no they have to win the house and Senate to transform and change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats in the American left want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\n\nThey don't care about that they are willing to for what they think America should be America's transformation on everybody but\nThankfully they still have to win elections and I still maintain that I don't know when but somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections as the lone remaining obstacle\nTo them getting what they want at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't dumped

media is now flooding zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just bumped steel yourself for this this is predictable [noise]\nIt was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip regretting their vote for Trump\nA reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN\nA independent voter is waging master in ways that Democrats in the run up to the mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this I you know in an added to it in a way\nI Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting that that is uh that that's happening out there so\nIt's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't ... I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important part of our lives and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you had people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one it's a different way of getting people\nTo focus on the importance of the election is uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have an everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data and since the media so hates Trump they want everybody else to\nTherefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awake and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there's nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I say just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get\nBy for the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished gravely in the midterms\nI still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is\nLeslie stall talking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility\nThat he has created between the European Union allies and us well\nI I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't really teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they shot hostile sounds hot he always has some of the way they treat us\nWhat somebody can in dealing with in within the stupid country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect you and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of\nThe left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be westerns\nSocialists they think still functioning at a\nDemocracy but but that's that's what they want to so we should be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThen I'm given roast Madison [noise]\n\n\nMaking a minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort\nBy Leslie stall his ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair is six foot one and a half dozen varieties not so much a\nCelebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is\nA but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comments on left wing entertainers actors actresses TV so called journalist and so forth and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally\nHere is uh just another sample from last\nNight Trump and Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War three now it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you finish high one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you have to try it again [laughter] I Know that whole and my answer is this I Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm totally in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhite and general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does\nI Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her\nWhy she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less they still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree\nEspecially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell him but my opinion is that the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I being really serious with you he said\n\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York state you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised\nBy this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased and I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew before he ran for office and I think\nA lot about the left a lot about\nDemocrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways

it gives her\nLook or Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule uh an anti Pelham a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is I don't even about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of across her to\n[noise] would you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome that's why I'm a good host I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that book uh intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how depressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful\nUm yes any intersection adults eat actually has basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist just saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA co habit tapes with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is worried about unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuffed ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ship has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press\nShe's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professor shifting African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native Americans just\nPray just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well I\nI I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right\nI just wanted to ... because that sub Saharan this is somebody what are you in sub Saharan what is it what it was it and then you start talking to some continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from I'm from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well no I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but

election\nTheir story says that the White House should be hiring more staff to handle a congressional inquiries advising administration officials to retain their own lawyers and researching potential areas of vulnerability ranging from the death of four soldiers in Africa to the sluggish response\nTo Hurricane Maria according to people who worked for Presidents Clinton Bush and Barack Hussein oh [noise] now at first glance you would think that this was a story that Trump and his buddies are not aware of the show lacking they're going to take in three weeks\nThat they are blissfully on aware that they're going to lose the house maybe lose the Senate this story focuses on what's gonna happen if that happens\nAnd to that extent this story under cells what is going to happen if the Democrats
