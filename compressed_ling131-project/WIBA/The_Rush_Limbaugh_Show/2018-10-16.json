out there or was the problem that bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include South America when other reason there isn't much in\nThe DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine lineage they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray\nOrganizations that you'll find I have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this\nBut the the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the\nWay this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... have or take the kids take the take the test of this kid using it in a debate the future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do to do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house at a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting patterns\nAnd he is going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it something you'd never Trump or his but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen the Democrats attempt contaminants in\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing out\nIn his career\nIn front of a of a stadium or arena sized crowd\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation dad he simply is not used to ... I mean it\nNobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and it got it precisely by holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin ... the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and runny four of them\nSay they want to be president now [noise]\nInjured the first act maximizing personal injury compensation is hiring a great attorney hire Steve ... and the game is redistributing money from fat cat insurance executive bonuses and skyscrapers to your future insurers to injured redistribution Steve ... injury lawyer W.

orchestrated damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted when the different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people twenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on assist DNA did not actually use samples of\nNative American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand\nIn for Native Americans now she's out there touting that it's true ... and ... you got one one thousand twenty fourth [noise]\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to evidence laughable it is pathetic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton was making a fool of herself each and every day out there saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica low but no no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualify me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be barking on what a stadium chore or yes\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium tour where\nThey're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged doesn't like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly does they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nWhen I'm Talking about this type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had I've never really the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near the wake of Donald Trump you know what\nThis is why does it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer\nTo me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents some ... some ... the state\nTreasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer every one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program than Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened every attempt\nTo supplant take over relegate this program ... already has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want that you may think rush through enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nCompanies in order to you to

over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking use only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was Clinton say they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't\nLeave with and it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the foreign could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was ever partner plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that

out there uh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed\nOr yelled out or whatever [noise] ah anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things\nThe the real objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they had been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties then to the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when\nThere isn't any evidence that want to warrant such a thing but the Democrats get care\nThat there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always rely on the seriousness of the charge working with\nThe media to create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked and even in their own\nPost Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I I'm telling you that they are\nTeetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and\nIt's in this universe framework contacts I just I don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it I think they're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible that I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing\nWhat's going to happen all I'm doing with you today is sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having\nFewer seats electoral seats in Washington than they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq who's saying oh\nSingle handedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\n\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke raise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are close in ... has told them to go pound sand\nBeto has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raised among yourself I'm going to bend is the way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but need him he had he wanted\nNo part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was but nice the office of the President's Day to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with this Obama didn't have confidence of coat tails\nAnd ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who is by the way what does he down seven or eight points not only the ... ah it's\nNot fair that Beto has more than ... ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do 'em yeah look I also have the um\nThe ... situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he has been Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by purpose here is again\nThe drive by is are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump\nTo ... murder my the way just so you know there are a couple of CNN ... pronouncing your name 'cause show jeep\nBecause there's two genes in there\nEvery time I've heard the word the name pronounce it's always been ... ad ... pronounce his name that way Robin Leach who made a star out of ab ... is Yogi who was a Saudi arms merchant\nAnd he was practically featured every other week and the lifestyles of the rich and famous\nHis name was pronounced ...

Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill in a secret video series of videos in which McCaskill\nHerself and her staff are seen and heard in her own words\nTalking about gun control magazine control whether you know\nAll aspects of guns and she has heard and her staff are all heard saying things to the fact that she can't be honest about this and still get elected so she's not telling her\nConstituents in Missouri the truth on a number of issues including gun control she is much more anti\nSecond Amendment in truth than she admits to being now the fascinating thing about this is\nThat there aren't any news outlets in Missouri who are using this James O'Keefe project Vera tests video and so many Missouri's citizens are not aware of it\nNow I wouldn't go so far I say it's a media blackout but it's just it it's not going to approach being covered in the drive by media or mainstream press\nSo I mean that's pretty much the sum total of it I think we've got some sound and the audio soundbite roster all of that coming up but back to the phones pronounce Suzanne Martin's ferry Ohio right to have you with us Hi\nThank you rash high up the catch me up it's not a moral question a political one\nAnd a on your mark showed gate I understand he society hit a thing and a U.S record that and my\nOther understanding I think you actually usually reserved the very strict stance for us protection so if you would answer that for X. I'd be very place\nYou know I'm going to take the occasion of your call to do a ... a ... a general ... biography of ... I found a piece on him by John Bradley at spectator dot com\nAnd Bradley has been following Saudi politics Middle East politics Muslim Brotherhood expertise for many many moons\nAnd his story ran a three days ago and you haven't seen a thing about this anywhere in the drive by media like Missourians are not seeing a word about project maritime exposing Claire McCaskill\nThe piece is titled or what the media not telling you about ... to dissidents fate says a lot about Saudi Arabia and the rise of the mobsters state not here just to buy a graphical things\n\nFate of ... has provoked global outrage but it's for all the wrong reasons we're told is just shrug it was a liberals saw the progressive voice fighting for freedom and democracy merger who paid the ultimate price for telling the truth to power\nThis is not just wrong but it distracts us from understanding what the incident tells us about the internal power dynamics of the kingdom and going through an unprecedented period of upheaval\nAnd he's also the story of how one man got entangled in a Saudi ruling family the operates\nA mafia and once you and joined the it's for life and if you tried to leave you become disposable\nSo what this piece is going to make the point is going to make is like\nA show that he's not a distant and removed commentator journalist writing about the Saudi kingdom from afar he used to be part of it is not\nWell the ... ad ... show was very\nVery tight with the royal family I don't know about blood lines but\nHe was you don't you don't you're\nNot allowed to become an ... an acquired that much wealth particularly running guns in arms with out being tight with the royal family Jamal ... cousin\nOf adding them to show this piece makes it clear as you'll hear in a moment that Jamal ... at one time and his life at one point was very very tight with the\nRuling family the royal family was in the regime that\n\nIt's not just wrong but distracts us from understanding what this incident tells us about the internal power dynamics of a kingdom going through an unprecedented period of of people it's the story of how one man's gotten tangled in the Saudi ruling family the operates like the mafia once you join it's for life\nIf you try to leave you become a disposable in truth ...\nNever had much time or interest in western style pluralistic democracy in the seventies he joined the Muslim Brotherhood which exists to reduce the Islamic world of western influence\nNow that right there\nWill provide all of us the first source of serious\nConflict between ...\nAnd the current Saudi ruling royal family the Muslim Brotherhood exists to read the Islamic world of western influence what's Mohammed bin ... doing\nThey're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation and murder\nBecause Joe ... show he was wearing an apple walk his fiance\nWas outside in the family says Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look it up she had instructions to call somebody didn't come back out he was going to get\nYou know divorce officially recognized sort of getting married or fiance that it's waiting outside in the family sit down and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and airy bought something could happen there reporting that here's ... was recording everything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does that even if if we had a new watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\nBut even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT eve service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the ... there was no way\nYou know\nIts its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches the phones twenty yards twenty five hours away from it I got a golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most about what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there's no way his watch was recording anything and\nTransmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis with a scene that watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under guilty they still need to be prepared to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start at it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be\nAt some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back into close proximity of the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply it it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and Android remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than\nI Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the family said damn with\nThe with the fiance now uh [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay for the secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob Mills [noise] oh\nThis is this is important because this newest\nThere's not being reported in Missouri\nWhich is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state about what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project Vera toxic Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nThere are times news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ Media Breitbart News you know cure report but there is no way piece here\nWhy there is no New York times here there is no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat or even though they publish here in fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here\nThere is no Saint Louis TV station imagine I don't know about Kim election St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now\nUm there's nothing in Yahoo News nothing\nNot one drive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project ferrets us every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is as McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the un identified project beret toss secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the end the project ... secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nFamously here I mean I think we can actually see them getting on to that and then it's on all those are a young\nMan from and\nWhere are you able to hear that are you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able\nTo make sense of that or even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript she said if\nWe have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward because all those house members\nAre total NRA folks the Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those ... absolutely get rid of high capacity bags of what what about for an outright ban oh yeah and not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way she'll say in fact that she's\nVery open to the idea of bump stocks yeah might have to get rid of everybody's on board with getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and\nBanning things more on or you can't say\nMight lose votes in the Boot Hill but you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can clean up the story I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel\nSo you people in the boot heel of Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in Kennett\nMissouri which is in the boot heel Missouri and I remember\nGoing there frequently as a kid there's little subtle towns down there I knew people in the boat we own the Boot Hill of Missouri here on the ... I'd be ... every radio station worth its salt carries us for it and I'm telling you\nClaire McCaskill senator Missouri's to get ... votes if we can clean up in St Louis\nNow St Louis is majority Democrat a heavily minority populated and she basically saying if I can sleep up with the African American vote in St Louis I ever really clean up get big turnout there then I can stand to lose some of the boats with a Boot Hill\nBut I'll tell you some parts of the country Denver snow fall Sunday Morning rams playing the Broncos and it was snowing before the game that is a former here too that a couple of inches of snow in Denver\nBoulder branch flannel sheets may be just what those living in Colorado need this week or Green Bay\nWhen the temperature goes down demands for bowling branch flannel sheets goes up and quickly now these are the flannel edition of bowling branch luxury lined up sheets everything bona branch makes is with luxury in mind and it all starts with pure organic cotton\nThat's unique to bowling branch it's why their products are so soft when they first arrive at your home and they get softer overtime now these flannel sheets\nThey're already in high demand they sold out in the weeks last year\nWhen we made mentioned so you you order them online at bowling branch dot com because like everything offered by bowl and branch they're only available on line at our website that ensures that you'll get the thirty night guarantee with your purchase if you're not completely sold on the quality of luxury\nThat you're about to experience you can return them at the end of a month's time and got a full refund that's how confident balding branch is\nWith all of their sheets go on line it's bought a branch dot com or two elves on both B O L L and branch dot com but used my name and you'll get fifty dollars off your first set up sheets [noise] and I think you're you're gonna you're gonna you're\nGonna be dazzled by the packaging and you're going to consider giving bees away as presents [noise] you don't want these sheep flannel sheets and the standard\nSheets would cost you the same shape at a retail store what would be close to a thousand dollars he says the same sheets that you know four or five star hotel\nLuxury suite you use that you get these are two hundred and fifty and the reason is they sell directly B you there is no middleman markup retail or an additional wholesale advertising promotion budgets and so they're able to sell the set of price points\nThat they consider to be much more reasonable that's why they'd be another reason for dealing on line as they want to have a personal relationship with every customer so it's bowling branch B O L L and branch\nDot coms we still have a a number of things that struck this caravan from Honduras and Trump's threat to withdraw all a Honduras doesn't grab that\nCaravan an order it or to return back home so you sit tight uh hanging there'll be a brief time outcome and look at this one of the thing I'm trying to remember what I've got here are probably two or three I'll find it during the break here I Can't believe I covered just about everything\nHas to be some stuff\nYou from place to place Wisconsin counties are here to help keep Wisconsin [noise]\nYou can [noise] your account [noise]\nMessages brought to you whether it was done some counties association learn more W. I. counties or\nI'm chatting with Christine Kennedy ... from the reverse chamber of commerce pristine read Bergen surrounding areas me up\nNext the Sean Hannity it to the mechanic at three on TALK through to tell you why don't you why da di di\nDi and welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about they watch the apple watch worn by ... [noise]\nBrushed one about why fight a good question [noise]\nThe way why fine on the apple watch works is this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThough the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... it can activity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even an L. P. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by blow to\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on a wife\nI network the watch is capable of why but only if\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that why fight network\nFor example when I'm at home uh I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connect via wife by\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe viable watch learns it but I still I have to manually enter\nThe wife fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... got a wife ... what the hell's going on so I checked that I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch what I doubt\nThat your mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required\nHis wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password the phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect to what the watch will\nNot\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate with this phone and if one of previous visit he had logged into their wife I network where the password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered\nThe wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened\nI don't know how proficient this guy was with tech\n... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been long gone with the password does not mean to watch as\nEvery device connecting do uh well I find that work half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got to really simplified view or do you know you people may not notice you and may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncles IQ sauce and uncles IQ\nAs a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that I'll go leaks phone will get alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are big estimate it will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as of Iowa eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice [noise]\nIt's fascinating it's it's it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that the show game would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulate ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife I network access it\nIf he done that if his watch worked on why fight in that constantly then he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the car had wife I Know it it it it it because he's probably be out of range for it but but it was still need the password still need\nA [laughter] [noise] well I don't know if they would say no or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find empty okay who knows\nBut I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um look\nGet another example of try to explain this you're going to a city and you get an a car picks you up at the airport or whatever and the car service has wife I it it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sure you log into what you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Madison", "day": "16"}
