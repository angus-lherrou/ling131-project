makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime there is not a single thing\nIn a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp of approval of winning elections yesterday when them within their closely contained bases districts and states their enclaves which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts\nAnd then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts and that's\nWhy the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with the leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country\nTo pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America\nThey have to rely on an activist judges to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or not before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current cabinet fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the less so despises insult hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the point what they believe in the idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obama Care it was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years if Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you renting ... he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of Alexandria or give us a call task\nWho's lunacy on display in a leftist district to New York is harmless but you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left\nUs you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review\nThis everything they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you\nThis is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yep it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans thinks oh\nA P has them Reuters has some\nNew York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where Republicans agree it's over the Republican was deathly afraid Republican scared to death no way they can resist the coming blue wave\nSorry don't buy it may happen I don't buy it\nI don't trust them anything I say on the news anymore and I certainly don't trust the bunch of polling data\nGiven what\nFallacies existed in both the news and polling leading up to thousands sixteen\nHere is a story [noise] [noise]\nI'm a website called the Babylon be a Democrats shutter at idea of having to legislate through Congress should Supreme Court lean right\n\n[noise] I don't know if this site is legitimate or not or if ... if it's a hoax site what they're doing a satire on the truth because it absolutely is the case they are ...\n\nOf of capital a Kevin are being on the court simply because of the shift in the courts that it represents\n\nBuddies undeniable folks it's factual it's right in front of us they have not been able\nTo succeed\nImplementing the leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress they can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide\nIt has to be forced him and of course for that to work for the use of force to be working half the cave to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened on every oddball leftist culture will demand out there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody's suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nBabylon be is a conservative satire sight I'm being inundated with people leaving for me that it's not only great that it's Christian and it's\nFilled with people of white privilege so we heartily endorse the Babylon beginning with their their points\nProves my point about humor in satire for it to be true and funny it must have an element of truth in it and it does at the Democratic party is\nVery much aware that they cannot and do not implement their beliefs via Congress here is

to Obama she has said it would not be good for him to be on the court it would not be good too controversial the integrity of the court would come into question there's no question this is what the wealth die as\nThey lose control over an institution the institution lots in their minds is corrupt unreliable and must be eliminated from the power structure\nYou're exactly right the assaults on Kavanaugh are going to continue and they will be calm as they already are assault on the court and rulings it's\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already all

mother ensuring up my son appears to be growing up to be a white guy see\nWhat'd you say is true the white patriarchal power structure at work\nI Love the satirical reaction [noise] that's what the left is asking everybody [noise] to believe [noise] folks I I'm I'm telling you these kids that have now become adults\nBut maintain this\nAdolescent degree of range psychological disorders and what

what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\n\n[noise] go to the audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span two on Saturday\nSaturday show called afterwards what does this she was running for attorney general or is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid we highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nVain and it just it it just after nine to but I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but\nThis is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of the CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me than if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or\nOr I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and their power their products willpower can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact\nIn this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we\nMe why women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it is scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were told not to lay guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and sort of brothers and you're watching this\nThey just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate argued\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we have Trump who cannot who has put some ... on the spider Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to is willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was\nWidely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down\nDo you think the American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king a book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend that time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month\nOr so ago that the the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lotta people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end I actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle\nUm\nNow I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot Maine the and this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago the other side\nThey had been shopping at the bit since election night two thousand sixteen and they're only getting more\nAnd Rush Limbaugh some middle\nThe\nFees for\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in privileges helps your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally\nIn Florida of the hanging chads the Democrats believed that the Supreme Court Hamdan George W. Bush the victory ill legally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court had to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they have the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward and George W. Bush was an ill legitimate president\nAnd he didn't stop being a legitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's six years later in the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats\nHave to pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back\nAnd they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore being duly recognizes the legitimate winner of the presidency\nEven though Al Gore didn't want any part of it by that time\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial\nHonoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks\nPrior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a pure Paul let it go rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\nRepublican senators who are friends of Wellstone who's doing it fully showed up at the arena\nThey did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people it was some time after a while most of them died in a plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was\nI don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down there than I Am Trent Lott into boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorial ... they're forming colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey were boozy and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having a rival didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators ammo hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the we're the Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing at them they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies\nThey couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven\nFor this memorial this Morial took place ... fourteen months after nine eleven took place so then the men terms a curve and\nI remember I was in my this is the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw\nI Do to fully accepted and I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans had gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just right now we're supposed to win big because Democrats told\nEverybody hated Bush everybody of resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just like ... and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is rightfully theirs Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen the Republicans gained ...\nSeats\nRussert was great broke all brought me out so and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial but Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\n\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president does elected so that's a formative experience for me\nAnd if it's I like ... if it's happened once it can happen again something it hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior but we'll still memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display four to four years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public they're arrangement public\nInsanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery\nAs a young boy [noise]\nMy parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer\nAnd the Senate was in session and I remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\n\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet OR Books or some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away from\nMe and said you are making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted the gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people were chewing\nGum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying here chewing gum\nThey would come which brings us to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all just come and then I'm watching this thing the other line these and these these these these women are going batty\n\nSounding literally like they are infants out of the loan that and they don't want to\nBe there and I couldn't even make out what they're saying it sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and Tom Mike Pence was saying over\nAnd over the sergeant ... sergeant and aren't don't restore order and the gallery their surgeon and arms will restore order and the gallery sergeant arms as having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery\n\nAs I said the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I.
