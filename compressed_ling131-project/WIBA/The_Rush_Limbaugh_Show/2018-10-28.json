{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "Entering into our final segment of the retirement clinic hurt on W. I. ascend Milwaukee WNBA Madison with Aaron coal wall and Jeff Colyer wholesome Paul crime force Jeff we had some nice call today good question\nAt great questions thanks a lot for those are we still have a couple of minutes left I Want to address one more uh uh item here\nA before and in our office numbers by the way our too sick to five to two forty forty to sixty five two to four zero four zero eight seven seven five six zero forty forty if you're close to already retirement and five hundred thousand dollars or more in asked his retirement asked us give us call this is a\nUSA Today article for ways to tell whether you are financially ready for retirement do you have enough money to retire Robert Powell rights for USA Today I think you raise some pretty good stuff [noise]\nIt's not an easy question to answer whether you've had have enough money and there are some ways to tell if you're on track\nThese are a couple of things first of all crunched numbers ... kind of all we were saying earlier don't you map your projected income from personal assets income pensions and Social Security I'd against projected expenses [noise]\nThis is the most accurate way to determine if you're already bill require more than a weekend of number crunching what's involved on the income Siamese calculating how much you received from Social Security and pensions if any how much you'll safely withdraw\nAnd then you from investment accounts earmarked for retirement assumed two to four percent per year and how much you might earned during retirement and then you have to make sure you add in your expenses to is use your income replacement racial and this is kind of a Aaron was saying earlier you don't want fifty percent\nGenerally advisor said you'll need to replace eighty six percent of your pre retirement income so for instance household with gross incomes of fifty thousand dollars many forty thousand dollars in retirement and there's a reason for that not because you want to lower standard of living most people one hundred percent\nBut they want to hunt for a hundred percent of their nets spend the ball in retirement right and that means if you're not taking money out for four one K. is you're not paying union dues or whatever else you might be paying your gross might need to\nBe a little bit less well your health insurance premiums are going to be a different as well when you enter into retirement right act or all those numbers change\n[noise] yep and then they decide divide how much you've saved for retirement by your current salary they said you know three times three to four times here to be ready fidelity investments suggest having ten times your salary saved at retirement eight to ten times your salary saved by sixty six times by age fifty\nSo let's just pick an even number okay let's see make a hundred grand a year you should have a million dollars and ... bucks sure\nAnd I think that's a that's a good number especially 'cause you have to take into account um uh inflation and you might think well if you think about and we talk about this all the time and a four percent withdrawal or a a a million dollars is forty thousand dollars a year assuming you preserve the principle\nThat four percent forty thousand dollars a year and somebody's making a hundred thousand probably won't want to live on just forty thousand now has the right using online calculator they say nothing replaces a human contact do but there are some ... uh uh online calculators\nSo I said before you panic so ... so what might you do if you're not ready first of all bump up your savings rate\nAs general guideline try saving Fifteen Percent or more of your income including any employer match you may have retire later retiring later gives you more time to build your savings and decrease the amount of time spent withdrawing that's a great point because if you stay a little bit longer you don't have to tap into those retirement plans\nAnd the last us get get help ... can be helpful but there is no substitute for professional opinion\nOut of four people on your website it says find retirement planning confusing I Love than ... [laughter] actually just\nHim to understand that you have to challenge the status quo the status quo for retirement planning\nHas not worked successfully for people returning for at least the last Twenty years so folks as we listen to the show\nThat our parents and how do we change the world in a positive way for you going into retirement how do we make retirement how do we help you make retirement to be the fulfillment of the dreams that you have worked thirty forty fifty years to accomplish\nThat's what this is about so whether we have a link a sitting here today which by the way a will probably in about a month we're going to have another person's ... that's although we cannot disclose who that person and so you're\nTelling me would have to move into a bigger studio well I'm not sure just how we gonna do it right I'm not sure if you had to move offices you had your bigger because businesses are getting better so now the radio shows got to expand to effect\nWe we have two offices in one right where are we we expanded across the hall and took that space over as well\nBut I'm pretty excited about the addition that we have coming on and it is a person if we were to do you know you mentioned kind of gone back in the past and through another ... ... there is a throwback because there is a person who has been on our show\nIn the past who was a third party then who will be coming on as part of the team over the next month so I'm really excited when we get the opportunity to accept a\nA expressed that and when and recon gets back we have a big announcement that our next program as well that will want to talk about people so far we've got a lot going on in the show we're going to talk about retirement we're going to talk about planning we'll talk about the market\nAnd it's all about how do you manage this risk how do you make is best for you so as we go through this break think about that don't go away we'll pick it up on the other\nSide [noise] after\nHit the road to take on the LA right\n... one of twenty five\n...\nYour NBC Sports radio updates now\nEagles first to their house in ...

enrich the treatment of our financial straights walking back it is [noise]\nThe power to the radio\nYou got to think of what you're doing when you go through that right that's right that's right [noise]\nWe last segment we were talking about it was kind of a roller coaster week as far as Wall Street was concerts pages for you\nWell thank you very much I mean she did you ever like go back in your memory lane and try to think of where you where we used to listen to that when it was you know the original time that that means again well here's the crazy thing about it that is actually a remake\nYou and I remember when the Ohio Valley players\nDo the first time right that's exactly right I don't know if I was outside of this show I don't know if I've heard the red hot chili peppers do it well here's here's the thing to attribute question do you do a movie that that that sounds from no Beavis and butthead do or you go\nNow not not I'm not trying to compare you went ... lives that they should be dangerous right at ... or what would you\nFolks this show is about retirement and we're having bedtime as we're getting there right that's right that's right see Enrique goes away\nAnd all of a sudden the might play mhm so folks you know we're we're joking about roller coaster but the reason we're joking about it is because it's not so much a joke\nOut there in the stock market right now right down up down up back and forth picture stomach away comes back a little bit uh them the markets are starting to have a little bit of fun with us if we can use that term uh and folks that shouldn't be a surprise to us\nOr we're in the longest bull market uh it's been over nine years coming up close to ten years\nAs far as how this bull market has run a bought at some point this market's gonna turn over and when we look at retirement and and the reason we talked about this and we'll get some statistics in a minute\nBut the reason we talk about this this way in retirement you know you might be thirty five years old listening to the show and you will have a very different reaction to what we're talking about and you should\nBecause we're talking about people who are approaching retirement or who are already in retirement and I think everybody pretty well knows that as you are going into retirement you want to take less risk you want to remove risk from\nWhat you're doing and in this case we're talking about with your money as a fiduciary and weren't traditionally from as a fiduciary we're trying to manage that risk getting we manage people's emotions along the way it's not just about the money it's about the emotions that take place\nThings like what we've gone through over the last month I mean the stock market was up that the ... five hundred is what I'm referring to when I said the stock market it was up ... just over ten percent just a month ago\nFor the year that is and last year we had a twenty two percent gain so everybody's just euphoric everybody's excited everybody's still happen on that bandwagon and the momentum is growing stronger\nAnd we forget that as we are going towards retirement that you have to plan a little bit different it's like a football game right when we talk about red zones would talk about the uh as you approach the goal line\nYou do play a little bit different what about ah as you approach the end of of a half year within the two minute warning all these illustrations and it happens in in a baseball game right the brewers were playing before and we wish there were still playing ... but\nThe fact of the matter is is that you have a starter and the game and you have relievers an even amongst those relievers you have a you have a closer right and so\nThey all kind of have their specific jobs that come in at different times and the game if you're the brewers the they don't call them close anymore they call them out to get her says there you go out get out get are so they're they're changing than the nomenclature that's ... that's right right that's exactly what\nWe're going for so folks when we're approaching retirement in many respects we are going into a two minute warning we're going into the red zone more going into a a seventh eighth ninth inning situation\nNow we're not close or not our lives but we're closing now a certain period of our life and that period of our life when it comes to money is typically dominated by risk it's all about growth how do we grow that money\nBut as we approach retirement and as we go into retirement that risk has to be pulled back because the the girls that took you to the dance is not the person you're dance with and that's the interesting thing and that's hard for people to understand and of course Wall Street you know the financial services world brokers bankers\nIt was the or just getting started we are just we're just getting up that's right stay with us for to come this is the empowers financial radio show

power to finance or radio show you know we started last\nHour talking about roller coasters um for the last things that happens before you leave on your roller coaster ride is either you have a harness straps for silver hardest as they put on or ever really tight Seif Elvis put us there was safety on that rough for at least there is an attempt by the rain in in you know and\nMaybe this is a stretch but the fiduciary what you guys are you're kind of like the shoulder harness or safety village where is that really a part of it right and so and I think that's important to bring up because uh over the last year year and a half\nIt's kind of been popular to talk about fifty a share and what's a physician if you're a long term listen to you know we've talked a lot about being a fishery before people were talking about being a ... we kind of chocolate bad because now becomes the buzz word and\nYou've been saying for years and what is it for ... somebody who's obligated to do what's in your best interests when you go to court you have a lawyer they are your for this year they're obligated to do what's best for you\nWell in the financial services world we wish it were really that clear it's not right in fact right now the regular the regulators are the SEC is talking about changing some of the words slight broker\nYou will have to have on your business card for example that you are a broker if you are not ... in fact you might have to have two words on they're finished sharing and broker\nBecause this is a weird industry that allows you to play both sides of the fence you\nCan be both a commission based person and a fiduciary means you're collecting fees and you you're not taking commissions do you find that when you say they're supposed to look out for your best interests that when you when you do you're teaching classes and stuff and you have a Q and a period with people who are there\nThey're confused by that absolute because they're like well I thought they were supposed to be looking out for my bed and we thought they'd just words suppose right well that's not always the case\nWell and it's not the case blind legal standard and that's the problem and you know you might be working with a really nice person and they might be moral and ethical and they might be your friend or your family member you may have known them for twenty to Thirty years that does that mean they have\nTo act as if it this year they may be a good guy go buy a house\nGo buy a house and use the agents that has a seller's agreement with the seller they've signed a contract that they're going to represent that seller their best interest is for the cellar if you use that real estate agent they might be your friend\nThat might be a good guy good good gal\nBut the reality is their obligation is to do what's best for the person selling the house so if you don't have somebody representing you and your using them you actually don't have a person representing you the way you might think\nThey have to do what's best for them so people that have financial advisors financial planners brokers that have what we call a broker dealer\nThey are obligated to represent that broker dealer it is that same relationship that you see what the real estate agent that has the sellers agent contract it's exact same thing for them\nSo people will have a broker dealer and they will have a fiduciary practice you'll see it all the time it's really confusing I think it's extremely confusing for the advisor or the or the broker that is working with you because it's hard for them to know\nBlur of their own vision thinking they're always doing the best thing\nAll the time out are you sure you're doing the best thing when you sell somebody that variable annuity that has five three to five percent in fees per year are you sure you're doing something and somebody's best interest when you put them in that non treatable real estate investment trust\nI mean and and by the way we can call the ...\nWhen you call it a real estate investment trust it R. E. I. T. when you see on your statement\nThey often will call it a real estate trust\nSo that means that even sound even better because outward trust I mean you know hey well guess what they should be up to Fifteen Percent income missions up fund on that and by the way that comes out of your principal you put a hundred thousand dollars in you only have an eighty five going to work for you\nAnd they're allowed to show a hundred thousand dollars on that statement they're allowed by guidelines it's confusing to them\nIt's really confusing because in one area of their baby charging you a fee to manage the money\nAnd over here and the other area they're selling new reads\nThey're selling new real estate trust a structured loans they're selling new variable annuity is that I mean there's a conflict here there's there's a potential conflict of interest all over the place you have to be really careful look\nAs if it ... it isn't always just about the fees it's also about the planning Tim\nWhen you see somebody who does call themselves a fiduciary\nVery rarely do they ever expand outside of just your investment portfolio and for us we find that as a real problem\nAs a fiduciary look there are at least find different plans that you need to create a complete retirement plan it is not just about the money\nIt's about a year in income plan highly you created income plan what we have our Social Security we might have a pension we might use them and do these we might use some bombs [noise] there might be some real estate we owns a real estate and more\nThere's different things you use how do you create a spreadsheet so you know exactly where the money's coming from when how and all that you have obviously an investment planned people understand that unfortunately they think that's where it starts and stopped what about your tax plan if you're like most of my clients that you know you've got a million dollar IRA guess what\nThirty to forty percent of that says uncle sams and oh by the way the next steps\nSo they've got a real problem because they're going to have a tax issue as they approach return and as they go to return it\nBecause the all that money you deferred you have to start paying back and that's going to send them from a twelve ... percent tax bracket up to twenty two maybe even a twenty four percent tax bracket because they're just hanging right on that lip\nIf I only looked at the investments I Would never know these other issues\nIf I only look at the\nIncome itself and many people are on the radio or on TV have programs talking about income income income income and that's the majority they talked about and nothing happens in retirement without income I get it we talk about income as well right but it's a part in it has to coordinate with those investments and it has to coordinate with those taxes\nAnd all by the way what happens when your spouse passes away\nWhat happens to your income and what happens to those taxes will your income goes down but your taxes go up\nHow how's that supposed to work\nWell you're right how's that supposed to work you see it as a fiduciary were connecting those dots were not just looking at the investment we're not just looking at the income we're not just looking at the taxes\nWere not just looking at the health care situation that's going to come up when I was going to get like a city it's coordinating an altogether putting it together so that it's relevant while you're sixty five and it's extremely relevant when somebody passes away in Ninety five or you knew that nursing home care\nFolks if you don't have a process that allows you to go through that kind of planning system you're not working with the Fisher that's covering all the bases was out all the investment commissions and that conflict of interest and those kinds of things\nJust might be time to pick up that phone and give us a call give us a call at six or eight to one to seven three zero zero six zero eight to one to ...\nSeventy three hundred paint you are because I just lost it there but it's just for the first seven callers call during the show called leave a message a we'll have either Sarah or at least give us a call back on Monday to schedule that visit it's free\nIt's none of your time but of money it's free it's usually about forty five minutes and it's designed to find out whether we're even a good fit to go down the road together\nTo him I think it's so important to understand that when you're working when somebody it it is about personality it is about you know commonality we need to make sure that people are going down the road the same direction the same kind of speed with the same kind of thought process\nSo it's really important figure out whether you're a good fit both for us and for you pick up the phone six or eight to one to seven three zero zero\nYou know it's interesting earlier in the segment you were talking about a new disease and talking about relationships and you may have had you know insurance or something like that and you had a really strong relationship yep and when you meet with people who come in I'm I'm sure sometimes\nThey look at it after you've analyzed everything and they're stunned by it and yet they it it's hard for them yet to walk away from that advice or because they have been together and they've been successful for\nA long period of time and the difficulty is to it because you're right that happens quite often and the difficulty is is that you've spent ten years Twenty years together without advisor you like them you may go play golf with them ... you ... you know\nIt that's tough I get it but the reality is more often than not most advisors are generalist\nYou go to the doctor you see a generalist you see a family practitioner but when you have a specific problem I have a family member that's gone through cancer treatments right now you don't see your family practice\nDoctor you see on a college as well guess what we're going into retirement we're not working but I I Will qualify this the only time we're working with a twenty something or thirty something is when there are clients kids\nBecause we really believe in family and so we will bring family members along but that's it we are of a retirement from\nIt is a specialized area it is up ... retirement is a specialized stereo if you use the tools and strategies that got you to retirement\nIf you use those in retirement you're putting yourself in a flip of a coin situation let me give you a quick example I've got that some try to try to do this quickly him whenever we do charts on the radio right that works out real well so you got to be people understand this\nBut when you use the theories and the strategies that got you there and let me give you an example would I have here is a list of if you start if you retired on a certain date\nSo let me give you a quick example if you took four ... one of the things I'm just brushing over if you took four percent of your money per year you're taking income from your investments you got a million dollars right\nIf you started in Nineteen Ninety five and you go from Nineteen Ninety five up to January of twenty Thirteen\nYou could have even taken you started with a million dollars you could have taken four and a half percent to start a forty five thousand a year and every year you add three percent on therefore inflation at the end of those um teen years Eighteen years you are going to have an increase in your money\nBy about Seventy seven percent yup your money will grow\nYou take the exact same numbers this is from the ... five hundred\nYou take the exact same numbers and you take that four and a half percent and you start on the year two thousand and go forward Eighteen years to this year and guess what you're minus a hundred and twelve percent so that means you're completely out of money\nSo the same amount of money you start winning the same amount of income but five years difference\nYou see it's a flip of a coin when you're relying on these investments to provide your income and that only folks this is the stop we have to fight and get away from as if it is Sherry from you have to if you want to have a happy return it you have to go broad base you have to plan broader\nFolks pick up that phone give us a call six or eight two and two Seventy three hundred and him I think we're out of time\nI'm Still shocked by what you just said moments ago I'm like letters that in the first thing that popped into my head to one two three two one two Seventy three hundred they need to call you and your\nTeam right away they do is you don't get to pick what the market's going to do the years you retire so you can't just leave yourself expose folks heat is so important\nTo understand these concepts it's been fondue and it's the old way a little bit today I get to pontificate a little bit so some of it's been fun for you as well I Hope you have a wonderful

the SEC never caught on how and how do\nYou know you don't expect to go to a ... ... attacks training and learn things like that but I came away with just a really valuable inside I'm not not to to forget about all of the changes in the IRS tax code so\nAs we all know we we've just gone through one of the greatest a tax reforms in the past Thirty years and that really for most people create massive opportunity and it was really a great opportunity for us to dig through an and find out exactly how not only is this going to benefit people but how potentially we can help our clients\nYou know really take advantage and and maybe go ahead and lock in some of these lower tax rates\nMaybe consider things like Ross conversions or maybe it makes sense now if you've if you've never been putting money into her off maybe now is the time to do so because you're finding yourself a in a lower tax bracket\nI'm generally jak alongside in the studio Madison money guy dot com is the website if you'd like to learn more six to eight to oh wait Eighteen hundred is the number again that six to eight cue oh age Eighteen hundred to reach Christian ... and the team that retirement income strategies\nAnd Christian clearly a lot to be learned a lot to be gained from attending these ed slot training that you were just talking with us about\nThat tell a little bit about the process for getting involved in this group or why did you decide to get started and to take it to this level where you would actually be a master elites IRA advisor I I'm not even sure I Know exactly what that means\nYeah yeah so so first he hosts are these training throughout the country uh throughout the year that that any advisor is a invited to attend now there's a cost to attend and it's it's it's really not inexpensive it's a high cost and part of the reason for that is the training you're getting is incredibly valuable but also they're really trying to weed out\nUm you know the folks that are just kind of looking for a free lunch if you will\nAnd once you've gone through that training you have the ability to apply to be part of the group if you'd like and if you do so they put you through a very rigorous background check they're looking at everything in your practice your your client base how you do business have you had any background complaints and issues\nAnd really are you a financial planner or are you a product sales person\nAnd if you qualify you have the ability to to joined the group and again it's not free there's certainly a cost in fact I'll tell you are in full disclosure many other advisers that I've talked to the reason that they have not done this is because they said that they just think the cost\nOutweighs the benefits and and I believe that many of them are looking for a lead program they're looking to get leads and and that's flooded absolutely positively not about generating leads it's about about really a high level education that's going to put you in a better position to put your clients in a better position and so\nWorking with an advisor that has training and education and understanding all of these things is vital\nBecause even as I brought that training back to my team this is something we do every day but even for my team it was very helpful for them to have me re explain it again and why we do the things we do and why\nLike a death of a loved one are so sensitive\nBecause according to the IRS tax code they could potentially become what we call fatal\nErrors and that is an error of which there is no correction you cannot undo a mistake so it's very important and so this this type of training and education to us is very important as we seek to deliver tremendous value to our clients\nAnd let's face it most of our clients are at or near retirement planning age so that is a very real a probability impossibility if you have questions on things like this or anything else and most importantly if you happen to have an inherited IRA\nI Would encourage you to pick up the phone call my office at six zero eight\nTwo zero eight Eighteen hundred in fact if you're one of the first ten callers on the today show we're

quality family time but um yeah we do a lot of things we we really believe in educating the population of our clients in our prospective clients\nUm you know we've got an office down in Evansville, Wisconsin that's not a very big community and we just simply want to be an incredibly active community member we've got officers of course in Madison we've got a lot of clients down in Janesville ah we've got an office in Brookfield and we're\nWe're simply trying to to to deliver value I'm sort of my purpose in life I Believe is to really deliver value and educate clients or whether or not they become clients I mean that that certainly could potentially be a goal but we we've been super fortunate to have a great group of clients\nUm you know we are still growing or as as my client base continues to age but we are doing a lot of education so we've we've most recently been talking a lot about\nUh the tax reform and and the opportunities that exist within side of that teaching people not only what are the changes but how will this affect you and trying to bring this really the real world life and and what does this mean to you if you were itemized deductions will you still be able to is the standard deduction going to supersede what you did in the past and by the way\nAre there ways in which you can re allocate resources to still take advantage of items nation including adding and at some additional charitable contributions\nOr listen if there's a way that I can show you how to give more of your hard earned money to charity but still increase your own personal cash flow and most importantly reduce the amount you sent to the IRS wouldn't that be worth\nA Fifteen minute conversation and it's one of my favorite things to do we're also doing a lot of things on the the recent and renewed market volatility or you know last year was the first year in history\nThat the market was positive every single month and so uh at the beginning of two thousand and Eighteen all of a sudden we were reminded that there is some volatility and we've been seeing these dramatic swings again of a hundred two hundred points\nAnd it's starting to panic people a little bit so uh what does that mean to your retirement if you're within five years of retirement and you have not yet sat down with a retirement plan or you have an incredible opportunity listen you're portfolios today are probably worth more than you've ever had ever and if you could for one time in your financial life do the right thing which is so high\nAnd buy low isn't now the time to do that now this is not advice

no follow some of the things that we're putting out there again all of an educational nature\nThat strike Christians in Iraq again founder of retirement income strategies I'm generally jak alongside Christian thanks for the update on what you and your team are up to my goodness it's just such a busy busy counter such a busy year\nAlways like to hear what all you have going on let's get back into our main topic today we've been talking about these two seemingly conflicting ideas as it relates to financial strategies investing for growth\nAnd also a finding a way to have steady income in retirement\nIt's important to have both in your portfolio especially if you head into retirement\nBut Christian how do we determine the right mix what do we put in that portfolio so we can't have growth and we can't have income\nWell again it's such a great question but it comes down to your individual unique preference and and the challenge with that Gen as most people don't know if they've never been asked the questions or they've never been taught\n'em and so so it really just starts with the conversation we're having a really a deep profound conversation with our clients to understand\nAt the end of the day what do you really want\nTo accomplish what are your biggest concerns and goals if leaving money for the children in an inheritance is your priority and what are we sacrifice do are you comfortable taking lessons ... is it okay that you might not need all of your your expenses or ... or do we need to figure out a way to accomplish both\nAnd then of course it's just a conversation and looking at the entire universe of available options and I I've\nOften said there's no such thing as a good\nOr a bad product in fact one of the fundamental flaws of\nTax planning be relevant to health care planning well tax planning in my opinion is retirement planning and the very simplified version of tax planning is what I like to call the three tax buckets we've got the bucket that you pay taxes right now today we called the tax now bucket and then we've got the tax later bucket these are your tax deferred retirement accounts for one case\nFor all three of these IRAs are going to pay taxes in the future\nAnd then of course the tax free bucket which tends to be everybody's favorite\nThe problem is it's the most limited the most exclusive there's only three things that can go into that tax free bucket and many people have done the wrong thing throughout their years in fact most people I meet with Jen half the majority of their money in the tax now bucket\nAnd the tax later bucket and we want to say wouldn't it make sense to put some money into the tax free bucket and for most of our listeners the best way to do that is a raw fiery but ... is not available for everybody you have to qualify\nYou could actually make too much money to qualify for Roth IRA you also have to have taxable income to qualify for off I already know it may make sense to take some of the money out of the tax deferred the tax later bucket\nGo ahead and pay the taxes today simply to shifted over into the tax free bucket ... from that point forward you'll never pay taxes long do you follow the rules it will grow tax free and you can use it tax free\nAnd typically we want to reserve that account for the latest in life we want to let that account continue to grow tax free because its value will not be diminished by taxes in the future\nAnd a great use for the raw fiery could be these unexpected health care expenses because when you take the money out you're not going to have to worry about paying taxes they won't cause you to have higher income which means you won't pay more taxes on your Social Security\nAnd so a great tool is Ross IRA so people often ask me why do you require us to bring a tax return\nTo our visit well tax planning\nIs retirement planning I'm not a CPA so I Can't legally give you a tax advice but in coordination with your CPA or your tax attorney together he and I are she and I can create strategies to potentially lower reduce or even eliminate taxes over time and one of the biggest reasons to do so of course as the unexpected healthcare costs\nIn retirement Gen one more thing the biggest risk when it comes to health care of course is a nursing home yeah it's expensive\nIt's very expensive ending up with some sort of care whether it be an in home nurse or an intermediate care facility is also known as assisted living are also the nursing home\nAnd and you need to plan for that because Medicare is not going to cover the cost of of a nursing home and it's very important that if you have assets between five hundred thousand and one and a half million that you have a very detailed conversation with your advisor on how to potentially protect against the cost of long term care\nBecause it's a risk that according to statistics there's over Seventy percent chance that a sixty five year old couple one of you will need some form of long term care in the future and you're exactly right it's going to cost between eighty and a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year to cover that\nChristian just about out of time on today's show I appreciate the overview of how you help people make some of those decisions about Social Security is one of their income sources\nAny final thoughts you'd like to share with us again our our main topic today was growth in income doesn't have to be an either or type of thing we can get both we just have to have the right tools in place to do it so any final thoughts you'd like to share with us\nYou know most importantly I just think that that it's important for folks to really have an understanding of their personal situation\nOr what are your objective and goals what do you want to have happened in retirement what are your fears what are your concerns what do you not want to have happened in retirement\nAnd for most of you you probably having a portfolio that is very diversified diversified the diversification and having money in multiple buckets\nAll doing different things at the different time is probably going to be in your best interests but we first have to figure out your comfort level with risk your comfort level with loss we then got to figure out your income needs and your growth needs and we have to we have to visualize what is this going to look like as we progress throughout retirement\nBecause as we mentioned in the show today Gen don't forget that your expenses will continue to get higher and higher and higher as inflation continues to grow them uh I often when I'm teaching my retirement class at at Madison college I often ask people through each and every one of their expense lines your utility bill executive costs more or less than the future\nAnd of course everybody says more and your taxes will taxes\nCosts you more or less than the future and of course the answer is more in your cable bill and your cell phone bill\nEssentially there's not an expense that won't costs you more with the exception of maybe some deaths your mortgage is locked in typically your car payment\nIs locked in typically unless of course you have a floating rate loan but the reality is your expenses will continue to rise and we need to have an income source that continues to rise to at least meet your needs so that you don't run out of money\nAnd the reality is there are multiple different ways to do this there is not a perfect strategy\nAnd that is why a retirement income strategies we do two very important things first and foremost we do comprehensive retirement planning it's a lot more than just picking investments\nIt's about looking for a state plan and working with your state planning attorney to decide for will\nIs sufficient or should we ought to try to do you have updated powers of attorney do you have your deed\nOr your assets registered correctly will they bypassed probate do you have the\nAppropriate beneficiary designations as we talked about\nAnd then looking at your income needs your income plan your risk plan your tax plan your legacy plan\nAll of these things are part of our complete planning review process\nBut the first step is what we call the Madison money guy fi stuff\nWorry free retirement and now so if you were at or near\nRetirement planning age\nAnd you have accumulated a minimum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars I encourage you to pick up the phone call my office and take advantage of my proprietary process\nCalled the Madison guy five steps worry free retirement analysis at no cost to the number to call six zero eight\nTwo zero eight Eighteen hundred again the Madison money guy five staff\nWorry free retirement denounced six zero eight

this morning about some smart upgrades must have a nice to have upgrades and when it comes to us some remodeling around the home\nAnd make something that's very popular which I Know when it first happened when the trend started probably paying you a little bit which is that the trend of\nPainting and you love would grain in it [noise]\nKnow I'm the painted has their ... and now we're saying all that just to put a painting Kevin as soon as house last year oh I Know the answer [laughter] but you know when we first you know they just had to be more careful I painted is\nUm yeah you can you can theory in theory if you'd dang it up you can repaint it but\nYou know these are factory finishes there it's a little bit hard to recreate\nWhen you you don't want to flash and show the repair and things like that so I think it was more just the nervousness about putting him in um now it's it's kind of taken over I Would I Would\nWe've probably should do a little survey of just the ones we've done recently I Would bet we're quite a bit over fifty percent a painted and some of that is because when they used to talking about panic cameras you would be thinking about which color\nOr used to be\nWhite yeah you had the option of white or off white [laughter] [laughter] and\nNow you know I brought a picture of this as kind of a Bush gray um steely blue I don't know what whatever you want to call it but uh we actually have this color on a on display in our in our showroom [noise] um and we just put a kitchen in of this color or a couple of weeks ago it was actually waiting for countertops right now I'm\nYou know the the options that are available on the side and ... are now much more than they are on the on the stay inside and people are fine and say you know what I Am sure the Internet has helped because they're you know you know you'd you'd look up kitchen is now on line you're going to see a lot of pain and stuff a lot of different colors\nUm I I Love the infusion collar I don't know if I Would pick up a really bold color for my whole kitchen\nBut um it does work already putting up some pictures of that coming up soon when when when it's all done but uh\nUm the costs associated with that is is you know sometimes people had had thought well this should be cheaper maybe they can use an inferior grade of would you know he's a China birch instead of maple or or oak a are painted cabinets are maple\nSo that there's not really saying is there it is it's quite a bit more labor intensive to shoot paint than it is to stay in and finish\nA says some more steps there um I I I agree I like to look but you're looking at you know our our our line they won't work force lined gives a pretty decent deal on the pain and Kevin is most of them are a twenty five to three percent a price upgrade\nUm there are some ... someone's with an actual I don't know how to describe it it's like they paint was one caller\nBut then they rush on the other color so it it sort of antiques and you can almost see that that background color come through that so we have in our house um\nAh we actually did our cabinets and we just just by having that stuff around our shop I think we have three more people out to act but in the kitchen so it's kind of how it goes but uh it's a it's a really nice look I'm you know and like anything now there's we're getting more samples of different colors that they're offering every\nDay I Would assume gray still kind of leading variations of gray as whites whites still pretty popular than it is\nProper or you know or some of these you\nKnow white with another color coming through and I I'm really not doing a justice by talking about it it doesn't look or you have to get up close to ... texture um but it's a it's a really beautiful\nIs this one of those areas too as we as we're talking and I I I see some of the the TV shows that people remodeling their kitchen at home and trying to save save a couple of blocks and I am going to paint and\nI think of the wear and tear of a of of what goes on and on and he wants kitchen um it's one thing you mentioned the factory finishing in them putting in using tools and in an environment that is very much designed for for\nApplying the stuff for the long term [noise] this is one of those areas where you mentioned the wood being maybe not the sum someplace that have good what but also not properly uh ... you know understanding how that stuff that paint is being applied for it to really last\nAll a like a home or decided to ... you know we actually do see there's quite a bit and um you know by the by the time to get into us their past that weren't on stage so\nUh I Do think you can buy yourself you know a few more years on your kitchen by painting your Kevin ... would have finished the stain finish the pilot starts to wear off it's usually around the sink and the dishwasher and the and the stove that's just the oils in the water I'm just curious to finish\nA you know you can go you can you can paint it um\nAnd it's we probably about ten percent of the kitchen is every mile had been through this process okay I'm going to fandom they bought themselves out of five years or so maybe a little more but like you said you know by the time you get to that point it's not just the finish that's worn out\nI wouldn't I don't know if I invest a lot you know a lot of money in those cabinets and just try and just try and uh you know like I said by herself a few years and seeing that idea\nThings like the hardware wearing out and just being you know as we've talked in the past\nAbout you know the leaps and bounds speaking of hardware um there's just better I was just so so much nicer options out\nThere that exactly the the ... of the big thing you know the the cameras that were put in in the in the eighties and even early nineties it just seems like the drawer boxes weren't built that well and they weren't dumped tail together\nLike most of them are now all of ours are ah they were there you know staple together and it might have been ... not hardwood and those cameras just weren't designed to last that long so when they start to go they really start to\nGo it does have to mention the one of the first things in in one of the earlier pictures um when we're talking about some of the some of the organization going on in in the in the drawers and covers one of the first things I noticed was just that really really nice dumped tail on that on that drawer and I it's probably just from [laughter]\nSo when you get an ... year old that catches my eye and I go to well built that's a well bill\nDrawer needed and not have to be a carpenter to to realize how nice that looks and you know that's that's address is going to last for a long\nTime ... very very cool I talking with Mike ... owner of edge construction forget about the website and construction company dot com it's all one word edge construction company dot com they're ... number six three six three three for three that's six three six edge and while we're talking cabinets um I don't know maybe maybe people are doing them universal but\nI'm having a couple of of of cabinet swim glasses are are you seeing universally doing and we're just kind of Mao\nAccountable areas you don't want [laughter] I think I Know why you don't want to Allah and em glass you know\n[noise] so we've done them um\nIt seems like there's a little trend where people are going hey you know can I is there a logical place to get you know one cabinet or aid to cabinets with some glass last you know

S. A. Y. O. C. Jordan you're in custody for allegedly sending pipe bombs to what the\nTrump critics Trump targets [noise] excuse me keep in mind is NBC reporting this\nA Florida residents is from the article of Florida resident identified friday as the suspect who sent a dozen pipe to unpack and just a prominent critics\nOf President Trump's suffered a law enforcement officials said that the DNA evidence played a role in the arrest them say sorry stock or say a cow ever he pronounces it as a white overseeing junior\nFifty six\nThey've seized his white van which had pictures of Trump and the presidential CEO plastered to a window\n[noise] [noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sent to me here said that he was um I'm from ... and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty\nTwo ah income information pending what is this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party a yet he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit\nAlthough none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to they may still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of ...\nPeople are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this ... everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking between now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you\nSo there's going to be a daily use of information or what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy identifying\nThe the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will as Dr buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive\nBy reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the ... to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also on his alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in and saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd what better time for the drive by to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wins and very often this economy still chugging right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunately the bombs stuff is slowing Republican\nMomentum going into the midterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that it that created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the midterms and even slowed Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the nose and what is it and if there isn't any news\nAbout the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped or it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the\nHeavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic [noise]\nIn the poll Ron Santas has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal\n\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this\nAnd it's one of these a sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for them in terms\nIs tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper what Trump's tweet while someone nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this uh suggest the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to to to to cover up any news or anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans at Trump for being reported\nAnd that is so all of this confusion\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the mail bomb scare is dividing the country\nAnd that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily now I the reason that I\n[laughter] the Russians what is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press have Chuck Todd\nWho don't believe despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief the Russians stole the two thousand sixty intellectual\nSomebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and ... and in fact the exact\nOpposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nWere doing the coding with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press\nLike the Russians could be behind it\nBecause it just struck tons of view of this whole thing was bound and determined to help\nA\nPresident Trump which means the Russians would have been but just\nThe way people think amazes me is always\nKnew from criminal Holly look
