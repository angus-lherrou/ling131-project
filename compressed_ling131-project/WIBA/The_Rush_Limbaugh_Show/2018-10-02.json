A. S. S. E.

[laughter] I understand the thinking but it just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why do we have\nTo in order to win I never understood that\nWhy do we have to lose Kavanaugh in order to gin up turn out I I [noise] depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when Jenna turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and I go to the voters say we're the majority and we tried we tried but we couldn't get him confirmed you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans\nIn the ... there there's a disconnect there [noise] anybody\nEver heard the name of Chris Dean watcher named Christine fair Dr Carroll Christine\nFair anybody heard of her let me tell you who she is she is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown Georgetown's not an insignificant university\nGeorgetown is the fact Georgetown University was the nucleus the center\nOf the movement to give a women as much contraceptive help as possible birth control pills as far as I could see Georgetown was the center of that movement and this ...\n[noise] well I was speaking loosely\nWhere this woman Dr Carroll Christine fair and associate professor in the security studies ...

you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed a cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a southern angry voices on the right speaking\nOut against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but CNN's the only cable out there is no Fox News there is no blogosphere theres no new alternative media\nUh Ernie really conservative website just start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the\nUh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I was limited it was not going to accept that would challenge the White House ought to be issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio this is the by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize I Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick that was his name\n\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine ... artist did his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWhile one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [noise] some public at the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other that'll camp this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\n\nNow as I say if

reacting to it\nAnd I weigh whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets an I decided to go ahead and do it in my never ending\nQuest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men tend to\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabin on his daughter says another prayer dear\nGod forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\n[noise] and it's just it flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nPeople at these rallies will be urging Trump to drop capping off in a second the party and the second Trump's presidents but it's the exact opposite so\nDon't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick it disturbs them\nAny time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upset at them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did on CNN NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kevin all at

that first you will never ever see your unborn child ... the Democrats really want to\nStand behind this\nIs this what they want to vouch for they're backing off of that this is again I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden the Sanford and bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again at his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons or a thinking on\nWhy that's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so you imagine how they feel about this\nThey bring their fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise]\nUh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wise is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up\nOne of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finished this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given a free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to get this done by friday if they really put the effort into it\nNow wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh\nJust yesterday NBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates [noise]\nTo get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying about capital perjuring yourself and that means he's not caught on what they've got to make up their minds\nFirst he's a serial gang rapist next the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative falling down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah I think probably
