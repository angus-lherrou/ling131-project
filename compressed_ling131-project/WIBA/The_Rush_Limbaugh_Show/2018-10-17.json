arming treat tone it down with Joe leaving the talking about his new album Egypt Beijing and of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles refused when\nPlaying music her radios inside the studio\nLack of respect but to drive buys think Obama respected open the love dumb but he did and\nSo you didn't give them the time of day and when he did it was looking down his nose but they didn't care because Obama was hip he didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except he wasn't\nObama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation in murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central is an element of proving their case but then when snugly said this to me I have the pause I had to\nContemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to women there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password for the consulate wife find network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone or the watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not\nClose together but only\nIf you have answered that was fine networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\nI myself didn't learn you have to do this until a couple of years after I got my first walk I mean that's how obscure a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware you say well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's most that they they say the show was recorded the events of have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] neither headline you probably have seen this show should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yeah I'm a Democrat National Committee cheating and election ringing down to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right\nSo see I got rid of Fox willingly open our mid to late ... had done in Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in ... bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nI don't scramble my eggs until mine chickens hatch\nShe said naming\nThere's so much she left it couldn't happen we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact\nOf the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although\nThere is even more survey data now that the ... story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focus on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned and shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what ... knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail [noise]\nYou'd think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here started campaigning as if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue wave or why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a ... couple stories Democrats are upset whereas Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find Obama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because the blue wave is not a walk and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat tails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it do you want\nThe GOP loses house now the eight people tell you well that's actually what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting Donald Trump is not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for excuses a pie\nMedia deal like it like it I like getting the point across I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't ah we went up almost six hundred points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk of myself\nAnd what about the your tweets so so far these people that say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that I saw some way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nBut some of those but there's so much this information being put a [noise] that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour [noise] I don't go to school at social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy and the history of our country and it's not being reported\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way to get his message out he's not gonna stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than it is CNN's media media whatever\nGuys they didn't do much talking residents just is too much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop promoting the country and so they're so frustrated they can't stop it [noise]\nFinally there's a new development in Madison healthcare they give you the power to decide if you're in

eight to to have to look at this [noise]\nThis headline from Nuremberg knows Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we\nAre idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensify and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything if has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on 'em every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now\nYou know they've thought all along that Mahler is gonna get the goods on how Trump's Foley election by cheating including what the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much for the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here\nBut they're there and look to tick the rain\nPsychologically screwed up bass he's probably\nBeside itself because this is really ball game for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump jaded with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished after the terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media rather than break the rules and release the report prior to the election they're\nGoing to do the next best thing\nThey're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro ...\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped up his big smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about before\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they are hoping that the great on washed out there the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\n\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made public solely for Democrats do when the house\nVideo feeds shortly after\nThe end of the first segment and the the the reason is they think my energy here might have blown\nOut the circuitry a necessity ... we were only got for what was in five minutes max not even that uh we know when it goes down a on our own 'cause we have warning systems early warning systems or emergency services warning so we know\nWe saw it immediately it was down there and the only thing we can think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program and re re booted it were up and running now\nSo the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you here's Tom in Morris county New Jersey we had to the phones readings a great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I have two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat [laughter] I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter\nOut there for for my when did your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay go to the campaign\nAnd one of the reasons that I see\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat by mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically to overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said that Trump ...\nAnd he says she only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the fresh prince ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done\nThe greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the\nCredit for the country doing well in that shock geo right\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since regular I've ever seen how we can take these bullet ... after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really you you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a nationalist press and try to reach people that his tweets don't read short\nAudio ... that ... that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it ... me it was me other countries said it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea I hear it newscast and they\nWell I Do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up on my machine aging\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it then you may know\nAnd of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have to say I should probably be met for tune into Vicki McKenna for your drive home [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred

keep this morning when he said crossed the center line and went into the ditch has happened you're the intersection with Walter road in the town of West sports around six AM\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump\nOr Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [laughter]\nDon't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHas to be something they're doing with breaking the rules that constitutes breaking the rules there has to be something there miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and I think for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch

it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\n\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate her he simply reminded everybody in real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and cause the media to ended up reporting what they have been ignoring\nThen\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford vanished you have no evidence there was nothing to support\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to you you believer yeah the basis of what well it does happen but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that we're there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point Kevin came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum monks that drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all\nThis\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around that Dr ... they're making a hero out of her\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did and then that fell apart a judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump claiming it was\nIt\nHad no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did by\nCalling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the the the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it ignoring\nThat the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees but\nWhen Trump called her horse face in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory\nSo you can sit there and say that Trump\nIs embarrassing I guess they were talking about people that way I think it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original take or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says while it was very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shantytowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she has no evidence blah blah by the\nTrump gets his news covered\n\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit have been throwing the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees\nThe media was not reporting of being Trump win\nAnd remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin Trump\nCampaign finance violations and all that so you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up working as an email friend of mine said this is a genius at work\n[noise] trust Trump\nYou mean so but he thinks it calling her horse race was genius somebody\nYeah [noise] in an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats tried this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what what does this say\nDemocrats are on the likely to pursue a major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue\nIs represents a shift in ... the jury for when the house Democrats last control the chamber in two thousand nine and they they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority if they're not going to pursue it's\nA wonder why could it

we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can do\n[noise] they've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why\nIs climate change going to ruin barley it's going to ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients and beer\nBad news for judge Kevin alright\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with three of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent\nHe's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader plus year Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more\nTrump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed parking was it was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policy is highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand gets approval from only five percent of Republicans\nAnd that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been of Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nCrumbled a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does\nI have to think that the drive buys are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher hears that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast

today if Hillary had one and what will it be like after Democrats reject the house I think that's the best way to go about this rather than just bugs and go to vote river to go out there and let me ask you a question about that I'm sure you're you're you're on this program this program is is a\nTailor and it it has the audience have has do you really think the people in this audience or so soon the Fox News' audience do you think they really need to be reminded to go out and vote\nUnfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some sort of treat as you mentioned earlier that might be\nLacking you know tone or judgment and some people the Kenyan that might change the ... minute ... but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican but you know just\nThat they're just keep reminding them of what the alternative is it somehow they decide they're on the tenth of a sudden\n[noise] well I you know I Try not to do much differently as when predators be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nI kind of ... I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I ask you I like to assume\nThat the audience of this program\nIs fully aware and up just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there you're here because you're concerned you're here because you're educated informed and involved and invest in in an outcome\nI most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously\nSo I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're going about their vote you know you don't want the Democrats running that let people already know that other words I'm looking for different ways to accomplish the same motivation [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nPlaces and I have a question I continue to get emails about the [noise]\nSo called Washington Post journalist or ... [noise] my\nQuestion is are really rather simple one where was this concern\nFor our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while they did all of this\nOf course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they were going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recording the show ... knew what was in store for him I did\nWhen he goes apple watch the recording this stuff and the somehow as I found that very very likely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only to us\nExceptions I have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do\n\nAll of this concern\nAnd remember Hillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in bend gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion\nNow of course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for this CNN all afternoon\nHas tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\n\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here\nAnd again I don't think the media realizes how obvious there's subterfuge is the people now\nAnyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\n\nDr balls the Ford had two doors that's something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading this wait a minute it was a five hundred square foot place yet to front door is ... ... ...\n\nI've ever Google employees going back and they had her own separate front door\nOh well that's that's a big difference than needing at Fort claustrophobia and pay the as the\nOnly thing afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years [noise] [noise] well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door\nFor some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe in the side\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive and then simply save home security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows\nIn the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I started wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nWest complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to get I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use white flour and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system that sends signals when doors and windows are open\nAnd if you arm you're simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness of your system it comes pre tested in pre configured", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "17"}
