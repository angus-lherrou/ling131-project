and CNN commentator\nThey wanted her they pressured her\nRevisit her statement the wall Street Journal has the story or has the story today\n\nThis is witness tampering this was this is asking a witness to lie\nSo as to buttress the story told by Dr ... Ford and the pressure came from a former FBI agent again who's one of the beach buddies of Dr Ford's if this is a witness tampering somebody needs to tell me what it is\nCharles Grassley was on Fox by Grassley as I mentioned at the end of the yesterday's program Grassley has been on fire some thing has really set him off I Would think that it would have happened ... years and years and years ago but whatever something has really set him off now\nHe's going after the press accusing them face to face them out right by us he's accusing the Democrats are being insincere\nDoing great harm to the Senate wanna grass means points is ... and John Cornyn two if we're going to get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof what are we doing for every future nominated comes before this committee\nIf the new standard is is it all the nominee has to be is accused of something and that kills the nomination and where\nAre we hadn't we're headed exactly where the Democrats want\n\nJust to refresh remembered bossy foreign and Leland Kaiser worm worm ... some said best friends at the time of the alleged attack by Canada\nWhen Kaiser's denial was brought up during the hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee balls the Ford attempted to just credits her by\nSaying why she's got health ... can't ...\nI don't know but she was not well I I felt really bad and for her\nTurns out that Leland Kaiser is a former pro golfer she does have back and neck problems but not mental health issues ...

and friends this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were leaned on\nBy allies of ball the Ford is well not just leaving Kaiser\nOther witnesses ... that means every senator has seen that every senator just read the report has seen this\n\nAnd that apparently isn't changing any about sort of vote was fifty one to forty nine mansion\nFlight and Collins all voting yes but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule\nBefore for forty two pm eastern time tomorrow has to be thirty hours after this vote was taken\nNow I Want to\nSay I'm not surprised by it Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now gonna not going to change I mean if if the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comment and it's not just on social media but so the officers that so\nMany Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used their entire families are being threatened\n\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they you know being threatened\nIt's enormous it is never ending the phones don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in his honor hinged it is vile and it is evil and it's not just flake\nAnd columns and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kevin lots of vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threat to these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator to becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted and\nStill leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term or\nThe easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and received praise or the Democrats that he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way\nThrough the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow the same thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine I Can't describe for you you might have an idea you're\nProbably know the things that are being sent to these people the for rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society\nIt's unhinged\nMuch of it is is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute now the mainstream of the Democrat Party the protestors are paid their signs are all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ... by them\nBut if you have an if you believe them they can on a nerve you\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be now they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she would vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf for intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions can be\nHoisted up and used in ... and I think we're in we're in a brand new territory here for a number of reasons\nBut I don't think you can say that just because Susan Collins voted yes this morning means that guarantees she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then\nAs just outraged American women outraged at the status of male dominance in America and I\nNoticed that way America outrageously and it's not all he was ambushed by a political\nMob home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them you write\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...

for Medicaid plans from optimal health\nHow did you get to the woman can add three on news talk through and tell you why ... why da da da\nVinci many recent months I haven't made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm\nAway from its intentions and its designs is founded and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration looked into it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant\nA there would have been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transforming America man so what did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack look and there's a poll out here today this was the Daily Caller de Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify of some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would they help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism\nWhich has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjured up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want their power around with women\nWhatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding\nNot just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up\nA guy published yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I have been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men that reminds\nMe hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of that but I Do but it would it be there but it would have six and seven [noise]\n[noise] ... quote\nKavanaugh has no avenue of appeal though except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\nAnother quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary it's combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime\nWith the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege because Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah burned like a newborn\nHe has plot ... his career you'll see\n\nHe hasn't had a series of goals and achieve them all all that guy is that dangerous schemer\nHe has plot and they get on the Supreme Court where he can a rule against minorities and women\nI realize a lot of people think that that's one so that that's what's in store here and of course I'm hearing I was going to happen I'm hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing\nThat she's going to do this after this program and I mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly is absolutely thinks that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise] but I'm going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone through many first hours this week without getting in the fall\nThat changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris how about\nYou know how to rush a good to talk with you\nI'm this Monica and the claims oh you were just speaking of the person that contacted 'em as Kaiser are trying to get her to possibly change your testimony uh she she used the same person on the way for Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent you know talking about how\nAre you in those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle an autograph\nThat's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Wheelan Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either a lot of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a doctor sworn mentioned in the Senate I mean and they test sure she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known at risk of of the smog McLean\nYeah there's no absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls have for the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with my life yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that you know the scenes here that has come out yet [noise] uh I'm Wondering if not the Democratic oddly enough or not or off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nAre\nGoing to go through and the last minute change one of the people are saying they're no vote changes it was kind of laid it goes down and according to then because all this is about to come out\nIt's not about to come out that's the whole point you\nKnow it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the Leming Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that he is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that grass way referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls the witnesses being pressure to change their testimony that Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not going to change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and the ABC CBS NBC began to report on this one will change one Democrat Senate about\nDemocrats delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\n... well the question is why when Republicans to make make a greater effort to come out\nWhy they were ever to a um [noise]\nIt's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see that the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered that\nTo my knowledge or Senator Grassley so for it or not and that's you know we were just talking about\nYou know they know they're not I can't tell you why they are not naturally OK okay thank you but I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou were sitting there thinking yes but it's it would change everything it shows the balls each side is willing\nTo commit perjury perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which could be added to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z for just saying that's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they have not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they won't\nFor ... the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate and now it doesn't matter it's about the

the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen a turtle this animated\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might have Senator Feinstein and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly one producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial a doctor Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWill her lawyers did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed a lighter texture and we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce it\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide that and he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in my October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweat neck of the

witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of ... out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that\nYou you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't jump into the senator or the the media\nPeople as [noise]\nUsing by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this

encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party there resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth heat up I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nI may have to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got\nAn email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nWent and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these

Murkowski Republican Alaska\nVoted to legitimize and sign off on\nThe most this pick a boat tactics ever in the Supreme Court nomination Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted today just stand with\nDiane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or doing [noise] [noise]\nSo the other interesting thing had other new developers here but hang on a second here's a second tweet from Kimberly ... Russell\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska today voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence\nShe voted to potentially leave the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block which puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money legitimizing and signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dashed city and and a number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a way if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of a leftist in charge of those issues and her stay there just shooting herself in the foot\nAll\nJust supposedly be in unison with me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings but\nGo ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dead OK I'm there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally with Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey're chatting with each other and Murkowski has a pain to look on her face Feinstein's looks like\nShe is\nThe picture speaks for itself it it it with that\nThat she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski it's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the digital camera do you see the pain expression on the face of Murkowski\nAnd the ... of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on the digital camera to be able to see the is that's that close up as the same shot\nJust to close up of the previously televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable she not\nI mean it's it's been really pains look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic amateur load I certainly what's the old saw\nIt's not for us to criticize who loves who

he may beat me to the punch now the other [noise] breaking story [noise] and it's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is kind of interesting\nThis is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is filled bridges\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh and he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this is in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in this state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is my co workers seats And Corker by the way he was also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions other men have engaged in against women\nBut his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we are going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and then we're going to deny because they committed perjury and I've been going to deny it because they threw ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made it plain that he doesn't think\nKevin ... should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argue but when one of the world are we going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nEngaged in it\nOh we've got to make up for lost time the left those Phil breed is and who is starting to lose grounds fall behind black burn in the race to replace\nAnd we are backed by the way folks me to tell you were running a little special little star from all ethnic eater I be store and Rush Limbaugh
