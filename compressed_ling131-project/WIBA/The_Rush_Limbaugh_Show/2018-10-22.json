{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "Do you think Kim Jong un I didn't think I think if you looked country it would show this\nI don't think he gives gives a damn about the people of North Korea he cares about himself he cares about I mean there there are I mean how many bottles of of high end champagne fizzy ... shipped in every single month imagine if he would use that revenue that money to buy things like food for people that he does\nOwn yet on the on the leader praise I got to set a certain image I gotta I gotta I gotta look I gotta I gotta do the right thing and so that people are awesome you are not so that's why in the leader you know I see it listen ridiculous expenditures on the part of Kim Jong lawn and Kim Jong il and his father and his father before him\nI I I completely agree with you I mean that they're ... they're tyrants their dictatorial tyrants\nUm but I just find it interesting that the juxtaposition of the original Trump policy in the original language of a President Trump has now moved to something very different\nAnd um and I think it's the greatest example that nobody will be sad if you hate Donald Trump you will not be satisfied with the way that this man is dealing with our foreign adversaries and our our allies as well\nObviously they already are similar to be clear if it was Obama if it was Bush if it were anybody else that would have\nBeen in any way in communication with with the north Korean regime I Would have been I Would have been upset it doesn't matter who it was that is I think that that was something that we were actually doing very right for very long and we were so close to being successful with and it\nBackfired well I mean it's a I I Do believe that a lot of um Chinese money as it tends to be a band aid for them that that's what I worry about and it said that they if they kept playing that game that's who is my first call here Mr people I Wonder why we have got to standing jak\nAll right let's go to sue online to has been very very patient Hey Sue how you doing welcome you're on the comedy show thanks for your time today go right ahead\nUm one thing that I don't want to hear a lot about in regards to the illegal immigration it then we were both at right now are those who are not\nArab crying or hurting people I Know they bring their legal they hit the right I'm a show that at that age\nThat is illegal reality right now and uh I ... for the most part and I think you're right the illegal is certainly going to be scooped up you can pay the less but I think for the most part I some of the small businesses that I was able to speak to here in Wisconsin\nThey utilize that they think you know they do the right thing in a um yeah I can tell you right now the hiring of illegal is going down exponentially over the last couple of years um I don't want with ... and ...\nAnd so that's yeah look in there but I don't want to be hiring illegal they shouldn't be\nTriple or quadruple what their salaries have been in climate nothing in it and not only run by going for a while and so that you see them doing that I think it will also really drastically reduced um identity that because they are working and they still somebody identity\nAnd that problem especially for young kids at the zoo and social you're let\nLet me play advocate here for for a minute let's say immigration comes to Madison oh let's uh or a parts of foreign Dane County in let's say throughout the state of Wisconsin\nWhat what does the media message turn into along with the Democratic party here in Wisconsin what does that turn into we've had an example of this already a where ice comes in federal authorities come in and they do the right thing there was a pizza man arrested in Brooklyn New York about six seven months ago\nWho was here illegally and he was still put enough to drive on to a military base in Brooklyn a Fort Hamilton and he drives onto the base he get stopped by federal police and military police I should say sorry about that\nUh and uh they're honest they banned me popped up is illegal the entire city and the entire northeast wouldn't sane because the pizza ban was getting deported um it it was still would you agree that our federal authorities are facing an uphill battle with a lot of miserable authorities and state authorities across the country I Do believe that it\nBut we're the union\nWell yeah where's that voice yeah I'm with you on that so that's a great point where was that voice uh again but at the union is involved in well we hate Scott Walker and Donald Trump we're a little busy to talk about the illegal or in fact the\nFact is I Do believe a lot of uh I uh that is improved on the part of the employers a small business person and I'm not I think they really uh gotten up to speed in a big way on e verify\nUm but the politics factor in so you have to admit it does factor and but you make a great point\nA three to one Thirteen ten toll free eight seven seven to three five thirty ... briefly might give it out the number fifty five ... we're at a time in what the hell did you do with the show the guy blade I blame you for anything else that I can I blame you for this ...\nThis uh this will not be solved anytime soon\nAnd I I ... I'll I'll ambushed you one last time\nUm do you think it will be the right thing to do to let the seven thousand people in process them\nAnd I just uh you know absorb them and do the right thing it'd be who made and uh the uh do you know the medical and the other feeding and all that good stuff and but the fact that they're going to be released at some point and documentation at the end of the day is a you know could be questionable say the least\nI Would say prove why you need to come in and if they can prove it bring 'em in if not again I said send them back\nI mean All right take a page from

plugging update logos fix bad links and do it in just a few hours and we complete Ninety percent of climate requests overnight and into website biz that's unheard of which makes\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending\nAlmost eighty percent of their time on the show the\n\nEighty percent male ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't\nI don't think anybody has ever known weather's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media\nNarrative it was a meeting that\nWas not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day at our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about\nThe states and the objectives are multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary mover is behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual anything but I think this was the left\nBehind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold [noise]\nIs that you are listening to the fire Limbaugh show coming up next to Sean Hannity it to the McKenna had three on news talk through can tell you why da da da da da da dum\nGreat to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new weak and broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to [noise] one more of an Louie\nGohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of by the way they [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the ah here's one from NBC\nAnd they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian saint palm pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising the stakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote dissident wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat\nEvery bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what takes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this [noise] I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nAnd one of the reasons this country is getting soft is because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing may as well just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nDamning\nAgainst or that CNN [noise] CNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show\nYou deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it ah in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer outward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also\nIn CERN ... there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor\nThing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out is look that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks it is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou would dare you you you he may not send the military they may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this incident what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nAnd I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized is the border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you're you're saying Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line get them on tape bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot of different ways that will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get off\nTo Russia and by be Mitt work\nVoters have a choice on election day liberals one open borders and we'll make our nation as sanctuary for criminal aliens Republicans wants to secure our borders

it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get him to see Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know\nNational media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of ... these ... these kinds of people\nWhat the Democrats are doing is continuing to show\nUp where Republicans are having dinner on harassed ... the turtle and his wife are at a\nRestaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad cap asinine protesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today\nAnd they were talking about such a weight loss of loyalty and she'll board and this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\n\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not\nThe things you associate with winning it's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\n... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture\nA seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand\nPeople have march jumped through Mexico man walk out ... they are those people were really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nHow many of you by the way how many have you joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yes they do\nOkay back to the phones we go to a voting in\nMacon Georgia great to have you with us on ER network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well and it's great to have you here\nI think the reason why I called it with a lot of years the military are retired from the gory interesting although we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I I'm One hundred percent for putting a military all the war but this one's perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this is not a military invasion of talking about a a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of think simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it play in the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYou know I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good at that when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual what you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're but you don't you and your ... your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot that the use you use some kind of force but not leaf all\nWe have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down to squeal like a pig and then it so we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the presence would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lewis Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWild and what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force I'm like\nWell let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then\nOkay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound in since I don't mean that they\nHold the line I hold a line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably what Bush or I'm Talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but\nWe'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit with storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you'll talk guys have a tendency to fold up when they're met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by half their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hope was to people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is to let them in\nNope nope half to hold the line and and like I say somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the legalized let's see it's unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nYet again right so the responsibility for what happened to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that that this is a bad left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the networks am tonight at midnight\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome and finds or helped me find them back home pros in my area the handle any kind of project you can read a review the pro kick their bail ability even book appointments on line ... with my wife I Love most is that home advisor is completely free do you\nDo it at home at ... dot com or download the ... to get down to\nIts people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well\nOur investment advice is about you [noise] it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life feeling secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you\nThe path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor ... that's S C I F E L people Nicholas in company incorporated member S.

rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat\nCandidates and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated runs a sentence last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the winning Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist and really makes the bones of an evil just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hid it would be a disaster\nFor Florida right now to well liked anybody like this guy because of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you live in Florida and Texas economies are growing like gang busters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news with being Zach worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a\nJust a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense is is a is a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIt and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where\nThe president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people\nEngaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because\nBecause I think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democratic party believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at nist Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact total wrong direction\nTo take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos\nPut but one of these up on the little camp if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ... I don't know where this was a chance to go just grab some pictures here on the fly to break at the top of the hour there are people standing single file on the second floor it is it looks like in the next picture you'll see a second look a high school gym\nAnd nobody's there and Joe Biden is the big draw\nAnd give them is sitting there with somebody else in there watching bite and speak and there's no excitement in his room there's nothing anywhere near what happens if a Trump rally but these people believe that by ... is the answer\nBack you know rush ball here on the cutting edge and societal evolution having more fun [noise]\nHuman being should be allowed to have home security is no longer reserved for homes in the most expensive neighborhoods\nAnd that is because simply safe has introduced a way to protect your family and your home with a system that does not require wires and be expensive installation that comes along with that there is no site survey nobody cramping through your home get mud all over everything saying yeah you need this\nThere and then there's this that they're just trying to forget her over there and the double feedback oscillator over here and it was all that well you don't need to do about that just really\nNone of that happening save their system uses wife eye signals to connect everything so the burglars can't come in a clip wires anyway it's it's all it's all why fight and but that means so much in terms of installation [noise]\nThere aren't any wall strip out there is no wires to run if if there's a a bad censored yes replace it you don't have to wonder about whether the wires ban it means you can do the installation do not be put off by that [noise]\nThink of it as having a whole bunch of iPhones is putting them where you want them you know if if they were sensors that's all it is you got a base station in the house they all connect via wife five of the base station and glass breaks sensors\nMotion detectors H.
