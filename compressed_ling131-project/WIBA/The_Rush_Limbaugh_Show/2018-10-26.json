the of the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nIn New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law\nEnforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them of blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot\nThat isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation that law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking between now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you\nSo there's going to be a day or use of information on what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy identifying\nThe people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bombers mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nA matters that same thing is happening today with the economic news we have a GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically\nGoogle also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every ended a stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in and saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the Dr wiser reporting today that it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this\nFrom the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate lifted bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I've thought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump to sign on to what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even slowed Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the nose\nAnd what is it and if\nThere isn't any knows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bombs thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the\nHeavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ahead I've got a pool here today from strategic\nGood strategic strategic [noise]\n\nIn the poll Ron ... than the U.S has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable poll it's a big deal and\nSo ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these a sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think their their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here\nAnd I [laughter] the Russians\nWhat is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press have Chuck Todd\nWho still believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief the Russians stole the two thousand sixteen election\nSomebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and and and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nWere doing the clothing with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press like the Russians could be behind it because it ... times have you with this whole thing was bound and determined to help a President Trump\nWhich means the Russians would have been just\nThe way people think amazes me it's always\nI called Mrs crane to thank him for trusting metal roofing systems with her new permanent mental rough I went on to explain how she's going to love her new metal roof and that the transformation was going to be breathtaking\nWell she put me in my place Mrs quaint explained to me that she didn't hire us because of our home was going to look she invested in a permanent member rough because she knew that her husband would never again have to go up and shovel off the rough\nYou see she's been trying to keep Jim off the roof for years with a member of the snow just slide right off every few days or so and he won't be going up there for ongoing maintenance because there is no ongoing maintenance\nThese are just a couple of many reasons why you might consider a permanent rough over a temporary conventional rough\nYou can see pictures of homes just like yours with the designer metal rough at our online show room beautiful

Trump loving a deranged individual\nNow according to Florida voting records he has a registered Republican full name says are ... and his party affiliation as of march for two thousand sixteen was\nRepublican Party\nAnd he's a been active as a registered Republican since March fourth of two thousand sixteen\nUm and as his voters status is um is also active now that information is from heavy dot com to claim they got it from the Florida voters search site which they might have done but they would have had to know his birthday to get it\nUm we don't always birthday so we can't double check\nThe claim here so this this stuff just happened to happen to write as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say our gives a Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American\nI and again I'm Wondering is on here with the with the information for you that as as I receive it [noise] um and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that ah [noise] the enough\nNow the drive by is having the stop their coverage and haven't joined the president\nTrump\nAreas that

rate to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I was gonna say in advance I I had this thought process and my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical towards the media and the radical left in this country\nThat I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there's no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\n[noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that Feisal document and ... and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the hoping into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats in the middle of the state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy up or even he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts hearing hates the left when in fact\nOrchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could've been corrupted the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy ...

to take action except the theory is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shut up or Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have an example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there is just what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street what these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way CNN starts this with their unfair bias\nOf orange and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it and ... about the stuff well this is politics you know what's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see in her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\n\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them is dated them is characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics\n\nBecause the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo chalk it up where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to the\nTrump\nOut a lot of people say but Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right\nI'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turkey perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you if you want it to\nDecorate and dress up a van that says notice may and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo [noise] my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today\nAs he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference\nA young black leaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner um [noise] and he's talking about the arrest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody [laughter]\nCredible job by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Want to again remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not\nAs on point is is your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... foreign showed up\nAt the

walks of life in the United states did you hear what happened when the president of the United states praise law enforcement\nFund during applause\nStanding ovation in some parts of the room but some during applause nobody took a knee and their nobody started booming\nLaw enforcement among this group of young conservative black leaders something else in in the remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforcement\nHe was very gracious toward the work done to bring this mild this gusting make America great again bobber\nTo justice and I I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits\nAnd commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there's gonna be a paddle on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox in a call Trump total front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and division\nThey will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the old Limbaugh the rub the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portraying himself as on

listening perfect McKenna at three on news talk through teen Tim W. I. D. A. and W. I. B. A. dot com\nJust to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held Obama accountable for anything that was going wrong including his own policies and Obama would never even always positioned himself as an outsider a\nUp against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I marveled at how the relationship between Obama and the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nAnd all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing never called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's a ... law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's for unity when he used that guy and they're going to say is responsible for it is not\nA man and they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about business if he's not complicit in it that he's trying to stand above\nIt they gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words [noise] okay for

is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\n\nHistorically a little pop quiz on the history now admittedly this

is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but ... point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore\nWe uh we could be looking here at the\nAnd a bit of an upset [noise] there's also polling Davis here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yeah here we go\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lean forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half so statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head\nOf Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ...

a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there's a Politico story today I actually saw it last night\nThat Trump fear is a foreign to wipe out that Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose

to that which is reported\nSo far today and you add that to what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what has been\nDone in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a targeted not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Waller\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver\nSo called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign he never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advice virtues obviously those out these positions\nPapadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I don't know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they told him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador to step and not just you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head he didn't know it independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigations go get the Pfizer orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't\nEven really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to we can do our best to try
