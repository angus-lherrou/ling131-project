area is popularly known even among the locals as the redneck\nRiviera in modern political parlance it means a bunch of poor white privilege people live there and the\nBuys are are surprisingly\nInterested in this I say surprisingly because there's not a syndrome major population center\nThat can be totally wiped out that they could equate which she she how dangerous global warming is\nBut there is a mid term election coming up and there is going to be a federal response to this and as far as the media is concerned as an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you\nRight now is exactly how assignment editors and producers threw out the drive by media are looking at\nThis they're looking at this as a potential political event\nThat they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away there is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum running against Ron this and this and then Rick Scott\nThe current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson and so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny that folks\nAnd you can't you cannot ignore the way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this um it's it's got the global warming component\nThat's number one as a category four hundred and fifty miles an hour lots of destruction a human\nA destruction as well it's it's got all the ingredients there it is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in in the er an abuse of mending\nNo no you look you can get mad at me or you I'm just telling you I Know the media you may think insensitive me\nTo

it and then all of a sudden it's a cat three and it's making a beam line from Panama City in Panama City beach\nAnd here we are um the media is now focused on this new thing Mr certainly do you think there is I Know it's going to sound crazy but do you think that Dr biased might be looking\nFor a bit of a respite from all this ... stuff\nYou don't think so and you don't think the hurricane is providing just dumb and Terry opportunity for all I Know they hope it turns into a tree and for Trump I just I Am Kevin all day hoping turns it and Rick Scott ... of course you know they want it to her turn that Katrina for every Republican involved here\nUm you know what Hillary Clinton went\nOut the other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much admitted everything I had been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there in the in her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be young civil and she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition\nThe Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility\nI mean they're making the case they're proving the point and there isn't I don't see in all of this in all of this crazy they're ranged\nUnhinged behavior of left wing activist\nI haven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it I haven't heard one\nBe elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back I haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all are\nAnd what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and the illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of American not\nAnything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window\nBecause all that's tainted all of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves and their families\nAnd their descendants and they didn't care about minorities and they didn't care about transgender where did I see some state I've got it in a stack I'll have to find some state on birth certificate just now going to offer a third option third gender option\nOn the birth certificate\nThey're ... they're crazy they're liberally nuts they are at war with science there at war with biology they're at war with physics and they are at war with common sense\n\nHillary Clinton is not helping them with any of this it's okay to be an civil it's okay to call law if the doors of the Supreme Court and try to get in to stop the swearing in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh\nWe've got that we've got some reaction to it coming up as well and all eyes remain fixated once again on hurricane Michael this next forty five minutes to an hour will tell the tale in terms of the actual\nLandfall it's going to be anywhere from ah Mexico beach up to Panama City moving northwest along the coastline Mexico's Mexico beach I think it's well it is all the way up to Panama City in Panama City beach but this I wall\nAccording to all of them and I've got some fascinating satellite photography here from the guards sixty and satellite it's interesting the way they do this you know how they take the um the\nRadar and they attach different colors to it\nNow what I'm looking at is sheer solid black surrounding me eye wall

kind of dark right it's\nDesigned to scary is designed to get your attention it's cloud top temperatures but my point is it ... around the world\nLooks like the most intense area of this is due west

that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks\nI'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named brand Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that Lloyd Bentsen right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the held uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nAre the Democrats were smoking I thought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama wildly most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats or the call to arms\nAre the most popular in a respected Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nBut mostly is already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or first my so\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for bold and maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in\nDanger\nSays it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible of\nDemocrats again only twenty seats falling short\nOf winning control that would leave the Republican dominant\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\n... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try ...

Long who says that category for storm moves towards the Florida Panhandle a window to evacuate is probably close to this\nIs getting stronger and stronger\nAnd you need to leave 'em this is the final call a for anybody that needs to get out or try to do so um those you stick around through experience storm surge don't typically lived to tell about it unfortunately\nWomen and remember women went for President Trump in two thousand six main Hillary seven white women did\nI'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women win for me white women went for Trump and look white\nWomen have been voting against Democrat presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there and so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled Anna swerved in to a truth except for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[laughter] ... ... the left as as as started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it\nAnd the reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving\nImmigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on on on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nMistake every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard die as pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most startling example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\n\nThat what happened in the White House you have a night saddens her\n\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nThe ass not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America\nIs to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each\nOther we're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court merit guard and here we go off to the races again ms characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face that's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants

but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump seemed to have any real interest in seeing doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is is only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only argue el rush but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... and ... [noise] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comment that uh by liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nA profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left isn't bracing barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society as always trending toward\nA barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending toward civility or barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy one more thing that\nThink it was a before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what why are they what were they light when the Democrats weren't a Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic um issue was a labor laws and um when what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah Mickey I beat Mitt word for it\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without minister\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nFive five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will power is at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time these are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids are flowing at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon\nRight out and get banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get him\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing but was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies\nOr the exact opposite and I don't mean that people at\nTrump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy\nPeople in the Democrat sponsored of an audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outrage and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way and it found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current

you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in big men end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so I'm used to having it throw in a ride back at him with the same force they dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayer told Elle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false stories first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that was Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nHer name sweat Nick I mean this is a slight\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on that yeah we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts and Internet fun of it yesterday but with my role as it is and let's claiming that they're partying needs now civility right now I'm\nI just can't worry when the mind and they left and the accidents and then fattening or if they begin to talk at all\nUm it just hadn't have worried about provoking violent and um you know to the point where we don't do anything ... empire and play comes to creating an armed guard on our cars", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "10"}
