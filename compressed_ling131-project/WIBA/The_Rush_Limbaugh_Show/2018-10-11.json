I I I Do get concerned it there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe\nHas destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences and has distorted the concept of happiness victim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the\nAttorney general for Iraq who same all involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side ... so called conservative intelligentsia shock that Eric Holder was saying what he said\nYou know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high end holder said screw that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we kept them\n\nSo people so my God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence\nLet's look at the things that they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated the house races or over their poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they almost won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the mullah report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it fall\nFolks they can scratch their bags with it they just can't they know that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary that Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\n\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaim Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West\nGoes his own way [noise]\nSo what would I be Thirteen

photos of why they should do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why do you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\nTrump to slam dunk to them on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House\nSo now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListened black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft okay they've had it\nWith ... said all of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he is he's\nAn attention horror like the president he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's talking negro the Trump Administration is ridiculous\nSays the CNN paddle wider so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence is launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population of surrender that is what's happening\nHere they're soft coup

to tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as ... ... the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi\nI don't know if he is related to add ... not common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then the show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a\nLifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so\nWhether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on is the crown prince in Saudi Arabia his father is the kings king ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather\nUh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states he spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the week\nUp Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies\nWell Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin ...\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin Salman mine's father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\n... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nOrder to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi\nRoyal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy\nIn Istanbul and hasn't been seen since\nHe went in to get a marriage license he was wearing get this he's wearing an apple watch his I found that was connected all watch was outside in the car with his fiance who was outside waiting on him to get his marriage license and come back out then they go off and live happily ever after\nNow do you think this guy's going to vote for this guy is obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements it'll happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise]\nRain here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise non a bonus they want room ... in the trunk\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the British three days of the non ... last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I Know what\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue to reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan isn't the only game plan they have and they're hoping\nThat the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to claim there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same doctor and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda uh either pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both\nThe right mood when were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working that's for rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is if we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide\nThey know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans of conservative stand up when every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what

heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has that affected at all by it we had it under the great control I don't think really\nBig was very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people have lined up they expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room\nMr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's working to discuss things safe and for him to make a very dangerous taping holder\nWhat has held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is he's got some problems\nNot used to being told you like this\nIn the old days Eric Holder can say whatever we sat and the Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or are they would say so\nWe strongest term ... we'd ... rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much oh totally totally uncalled for and we we were kingly unilaterally condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nHe'd better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I he better be careful\nWhat he's wishing for now the stock market's been kind of the song it's been a roller coaster ring and Trump\nIs suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks\nThere are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would they would encourage some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on not to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it look at our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms\nSo there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing this\nStock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression when is the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional\nInside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time totally unnecessary Fort right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way and the federal\nReserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists\nAs they are as many financial institutions and I've got a pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of Trump\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react to it and and this roller coaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids are there are some that I I'm not at all with yes and what we've done out slowly but surely\nUrban some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter to the times that there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first and maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that\nPiece that memo that some pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal lives of president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we love business\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day whenever I go back and check the transcript\nBiting it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us that somebody ... wrote it\nBut I think this is somebody from the editorial board the editorial staff one of the up and people\nThis is a New York times creation I think they're that big a widow and I think they are that frustrated I think they have tried everything that has always worked to destroy Republican presidents and it just bounces off of Trump nothing hurts him\nRejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from him\n\nIn October two thousand sixty ... senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump had an openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate was Clinton on October the nineteenth he said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded I'll keep you in\nSuspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical Ben Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating be election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being then certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell income the laser rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fond of resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place\nAnd no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it\nYou're pro last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more\nThat was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nTo this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this\nStory New York magazine they think they're doing an ad a boy here and they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting that there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome\nMake sure that you've secured your private records or email accounts et cetera if in doubt set new passwords for more info check out this divorce dot com it's a great resource and it's
