this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing to the whole premise of climate change you are agreeing to a lot you're agreeing you are to\nBlame and that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make amends and how to do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you agreed to

grand jury now wait a minute this to Brafman we're coming off the Kavanaugh hearings were we were told women can't lie and we were told that women don't lie and we were told that we're not to think women lie anyway and you are now\nSaying that a charge was dropped because a witness who came forward and committed perjury perjury before a grand jury\n\nDon't worry Harvey Weinstein is still a creepy pervert out there still has five counts against\nHim but in this case he found somebody who was willing to sell in what he wanted and they reduced the five to six charges to five speaking of Hillary [noise] you know what I'm Wondering if it's not that rushed her real quick I have a feeling\nBeing that we're going to have a Hillary Clinton this is amazing by the way this has recycling an old story that we have previously laughed at I Can't tell you how many what looks like okay good\nDon't have it here no big deal Hillary Clinton to Trump you asked Russia hacked me on national TV this is the most amazing thing and this story is another great illustration of the divide\nThat exist between saying and insane in this country\nAnd how the people on the insane side had literally no sense of humor have none no perception of what so ever of humor\nHillary Clinton fired back and President Trump yesterday after reclaimed today earlier that Clinton had engaged in a conspiracy with Russia\nDuring Wednesday nights campaign rally in Pennsylvania Trump told the crowd there had been collusion and he said well if you look at it when you think of but there was no collusion between Hillary and the Democrats in Russia there was collusion there was a lot of collusion with Russia and lots of other people by the way\nAnd he's right what he's talking about here is the Clinton campaign the Democratic National Committee hired fusion GPS founded by Glenn Simpson who's refusing subpoenas to testify to Congress claiming the Fifth Amendment\nFusion GPS took the money from the Clinton campaign the DNC and went to a law firm cut out called Perkins ... this was done to make Hillary and the DNC is money to look like they were buying a legal advice and campaign advice\nBut the law firms then funnel the money after wandering through Christopher Steele and he went out and created this lying stinking phony dot CA the one that has the story that Trump hired a bunch of prostitutes\nIn Moscow to urinate on a bad that had been slept in Bible rock Hussein all and Michelle my bell oh\nThe ... is is not a single bit of it as ever been corroborated like balls the Ford story not a single bit of corroborate ... no evidence whatsoever and yet that dot CA was used to get a finds a warrant the spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd that dot CA is what kicked off in a truth ... special counsel investigation to try to find collusion between Trump and Russia to many of his old knows but that's what Trump's we're learning to and Trump is exactly right the collusion here between anybody in Russia is Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd the route is Hillary Clinton DNC to a a\nFusion GPS then on to ... and then just deals so the money's still got went through a bunch of different layers before he got it but they essentially commissioned an opposition research hit piece on Trump that they tried to sell every body was legitimate Intel's Trump supported miss out\nHillary those bananas she can't believe the truth is being told about her she can't believe that they can't let this day and so she has to Trump is the guy to ask the rushes to heck me he did it on national TV Trump is the guy that he would and they have tried to make this case\nI it's the funniest thing in the world Trump was down in Miami at his resort down there to route and this was a period of time where Hillary's emails ever sixty thousand total on her server\nAnd she told that there were legal or illegal server private server private address while she sector estate\nIs was discovered new and it was Hillary was told she had to turn some of those over she says well half of these are personal and their nobody's business there about Chelsea's wedding reception and her

openly reject ah any claim that somebody change their mind or talk not everybody but a lot of people that way\nOr the\nHypocrisy is not useless I mean it is highly entertaining and it is substantiate

[noise] but she put it up and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it\nIt's fairly common that these people on the left engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ...\nThe Democrats blue wave is drying up oh if that would be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals supposedly govern the twenty Eighteen mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely tilt Democrat and it's in line with attorney general Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballot that shows a Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims it's\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the ... Senate that would require due to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seats if they have\nBeen held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise]\nIt's [noise] let me go state by state the show where this is all happening and but the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\n\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this was a\nTraditional gear party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot pose which say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races somebody could go either way\n\nThey're still hanging on to hope they are reporting but hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening to light it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now\n... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the want the murder of thousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who did covered Michele marketed was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi and hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in a\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars and again people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done\nAnd the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural movie like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and violence in the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder he was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are old buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked\nAt it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story\nItself is all anybody needs to know the number one\nMass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left abortion is not even human and viable tissue mass or what have you ah it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays\nA guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings and for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest [noise]\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess or as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to states PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGoing to be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people to put their careers on the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy a directing\nThe film [noise] um [noise] [noise]\nYou're recall the story yesterday I told you about Jamal ...\nThe Saudi journalist who is reportedly\nBeen dismembered murdered in the Saudi consulate
