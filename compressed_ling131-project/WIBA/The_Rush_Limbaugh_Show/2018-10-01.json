none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she is the last\n\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically said to be credible every leftist\nSupposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so still shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like\nThat I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think it's scripted\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\nAmericans believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored a Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred before the registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent of\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans\nThe other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the name ... witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven\nPercent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a wink agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got Coney entering the picture\nNow we've got a call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for

association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that ah there's no better way to um motivate each group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm\nOf that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last two twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect if they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I I'm a ...

Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is that incident\nWell could be I mean the but the the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we get a poll in June or a poll and mayor even July and it tells us what the public\nIs thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything 'cause it's not when the election is and I said the ... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened\nYet I said that in July August September ... and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this oh dear this is going to get resolved one\nWay or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes\nIf the Democrats Lewis this uh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed a\nThan what a democratic voters going to do they get us going to

Flake just seventies not the only one that a lot of people saying this\nAfter Christine balls the forge credible testimony I'm getting calls from women all over America who have been inspired to come forward because of her brain but I'm currently just testimony\nWell now wait a minute did Anita Hill cause women coming forward in droves and what about the me too movement itself\nDidn't Harvey Weinstein team cause women to start calling in and coming through in droves saying yes it's happened to me\nAnd then every other person named Matt Lauer Les Moonves NBC CBS all of these me two guys that had been named in called out why did move that\nInspire women all over America got a call Congress and say yeah it happened to me to in other words they're asking us to believe that women are out there\nSuffering although suffering in private suffering in anonymity and it was Christine Woolsey for it in her testimony which is causing women to call Congress in droves well what if women been doing all during the me too movement\nDon't misunderstand me I'm saying\nThat she's a late a rival to this\nThe idea of men abusing women and the me too movement I mean the truffle stories don't misunderstand me here\nShe is by no means the first women have been coming out of the woodwork claiming Hollywood this Hollywood that abuse me this guy or mistreated\nMe rape me wonder how about the United uh University of Virginia Rolling Stone story how about Lena Dunham talking about all the horrible things have happened to her having all of these stories caused women to feel a new only emancipated to come forward with their stories\nAnd yet on the tail end of the me too movement after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill and so forth Christie ... goes in testifies in places and I'm hearing from so many women who are saying\nWell no my point is that I think anybody can say that but we don't know who's calling these people we don't even know if the people calling him or not\nDemocrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women so courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon\nIt's not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness insensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened\nBefore and that adds to her credibility don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing\nNot saying women coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing that they are\nBelieve me [laughter] talk [laughter]\nGo go ask Harvey

all part of the\nPlan to make this particular incident\nRevolutionary\nNew and so important because this brave courageous woman is causing other women to be brave in ways they've never felt like being before and I think that's not right I think the sensitization insensitivity the\nConsciousness raising has been going on since winds danger even before that but every time there's a public incident like this involving male abuse or alleged male abuse\nPart and parcel of it and I'm hearing from women all over America who are so thankful to Dr Ford because she has given me the ... ... did the me

the Democrats attempt to get rid of Trump that's what this all IEDs and the reason they targeted flake as 'cause they know that flight cage Trump flake can't get reelected in Arizona because the Trump\nWhite despises Trump\nHe has for I don't know how long he's eager to screw Trump while making it look like\nThat he is standing in solidarity with the abused women of America but that's not what this is about from the Democrats the flight to the media this is about raw hatred that Donald Trump\nAnd making sure he has denied this court seat or any other courts see that and making sure that Trump doesn't get anything ... did they bleep done\nThis is about getting rid of Donald Trump this is about making sure that that Trump is paralyzed as administration following the midterms in November if anything if anything ought to be inspiring Republicans to vote is that\n\nIt is that the Democrats and the Republican conservative never Trump or isn't trying to destroy the presidency

I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say it's the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides the needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when whatever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she sounds were their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI did talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads and when they don't find anything on my Bob Mueller they stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Madison", "day": "01"}
