today we're doing great doing a standing or good morning to our listeners to know Pete inner listener base I Know you've been doing this show forever but there's always new listeners since for those new lister is checking out the show for the first time maybe educate them and what the shows all about\nIt you know Jim uh there probably are always new listeners list and right but what the show is about it's about retirement but maybe it was a twist right because we're about challenging the status quo we're changing how people look at retirement\nPete I think one thing we aspire to be like is is apple early on they changed the way we we use computers and they change the way we view phones they're always out they're challenging the status quo they're innovative\nBut there's thinking differently and so when we you know we have this radio program and we we do occasionally events at local colleges and uh we meet with people it's about educating it's about educating\nRetirement and retirement planning is so much bigger than just is sixty forty portfolio right with your investment\n... are there are there are a lot of different facets to retirement there are for say there are like six pillars to retirement\nThere's at least six colors that everybody needs to have covered we like to say pillars you could think of a mess puzzle pieces you could uh pieces to a bridge you you can pin them you know put them together all sorts of different ways but it is about that planning in the process of the planning I mean\nThat you used to create this plan that includes at least an income plan an investment plan\nA tax plan yellow shirt in the room and it's the health care and the long term care plan and then of course the legacy plan if we don't have all of these put together we don't have a plan we\nMight have pieces of a plan we have investments but we don't have the whole plant\nPaid I think you're skipped over one of the most important I Know I'm let me start with this right you I think you ignored it and um and that's the ... folks we both we we're fishery um we're all fisheries were from landing from\nUm the focus is on all aspects we don't just do investments like beat mentioned we do all other areas\nAnd what's important about that and and why kind of left that out on purpose to have a little bit of fun but the reality is is that you need if you're building a house you need an architect if you are running a team you need a coach you need a leader\nSo it is really important we believe it's extremely important to be working with somebody who is obligated to do with your best interest hell do a little bit higher standard right\nRight Pete when you're ... that means you're doing whatever's in the best interest of the client and\nThen in the best interests of us or our firm\nAnd for us in today's world this means we're challenging the status quo we're building financial plans for retirement it's comprehensive it's panoramic and it's about the process of how that takes place\nAnd reach out here people on the radio on TV I read it in books or newspapers people have a process it's always a sales process we actually have a planning process that allows people to go from a to Z in retirement so folks\nLet's challenge the status quo for the next hour while we're\nTogether and ah let's start really helping people ... their retirement to

I think it's because like we said in the first segment we challenge the status quo we do things very differently\nAnd one of the biggest things we take care of up from his income plain folks that are with us know that all the money they need to to live the kind of life they want is not dependent on the market money that they have in the ...\nMark it oftentimes will be play money or additional money you know and inflation hedge money yup so they're not worried they know they're taking care of and and it's not affecting their sleep\nSo a different approach gets a very different result right and and I would just add on to what you said is is that it's really about that overall planning right\nWe have people in the market and you know we've talked and I want to during the segment talk a little bit about some of the strategies we use in the market or thinking for the strategies that we use in the market\nBut it really is about that overall planning to not just about what's the money doing it in the market if you've got to ... up an income plan put together and you know where your income is coming from that resolves a whole lot of problems right\nPlus we're managing risk in the market and so guess what when you manage you've got three options you can ignore it you can manage it or you can ensure it\nUse some insurance we use the managing and we definitely do our best never to it in All right well that's correct so but it's about the planning process now we've mentioned a couple of things and by the way the market you know folks\nAs we talk about this for years we have talked about the fact that when you get to retirement\nYou kind of turn your your portfolio on its head what got you to retirement is risk thinking right we took a lot of risk Oregon returns\nBut yeah we're we're in mutual funds that that definitely have more opportunities for returns more opportunities for losses right and that's and then we got there and we'll money away\nAnd so when you are younger and you're putting money away what you do is you focus on those returns and those returns typically come through risk but when we're in retirement\nYou know it's now about how do we hang onto that money and yes we want to grow but its principal protection first it's income\nDistribution then comes grill and so what happens is instead of us looking at it from top to bottom risk to safety we now look at it from safety perspective then to risk\nSo when you change that mindset it turns the paradigm on its head it turns your vision the perspective where you're looking at it it changes it makes a very different\nSo we're managing risk we're taking precautions we are creating income plans were finishing out the rest like you know legacy planning and taxes and long term care and all working together Pete right they're all coordinated they have to be coordinated if they're not coordinated\nAnd you you don't have a complete plans so when we talk about challenging the status quo you know the stock market is had a really rough week right back around the world people don't probably realize this but like you go to China and their stock market they're already in a better market there already down twenty five percent\nHere in the United states were still up for the year even with this roughly that we had it's still up for the year when do you make your change when you take the chips off the table\nIt can right yup what do you do about it folks\nI also I Want to I Want to put up I mean bringing my computer up so you can see this right\nBut I've got this when we're talking comparisons with apple computers and other computers sometimes you know I I kind of live on the edge of being just a nerd and I'm In an office with a bunch of young people so they laugh at me when it comes to technology but I've got my laptop in front of me\nAnd I want to make an illustration that you cannot see but you can hear\nAnd then is that is that when it comes to investing in the market\nDo you have to take the most risk to get the most returns let me give you an example please do so we often talk about risk numbers on the show right we've done that in the past we use that software risk lies\nNobel Prize winning mathematics behind it okay so right now the stock market has a risk or Seventy one the higher the score of the more risky from one to Ninety nine cents yeah makes sense\nSo what if you're using a strategy in the market that has a risk score of forty\nThat over the last Twenty years has a rate of return of twelve plenty versus what you and I have been taught is the quote unquote retirement portfolio which is sixty percent in stock and forty percent and bonds and that's only average five point nine percent\nWhat think about that how do you get a lower risk or then the stock market even\nIn the stock market's averaged ... percent over that time frame that's almost half the rest ... almost just a little over half the risk let me give you another example I can give you a strategy in fact that's one of the strategies we use has a risk or fifty one by the way\nThere over the last ten years has beat in the market how many times four times four times out of town that's it\nSo immediately people are going to repeat why would we use that strategy why would we pay you to fail six out of ten times because that's how people think about it right yeah that that is so when the brewers play right and when they're in the playoffs\nIn vain score but that's put them against the cubs have uses illustration before the cubs score six innings in a row one run per inning\nAnd in the seventh the brewer score seven runs no more scoring for the rest of the game who won the game the ... but the only score didn't want any\nThe key is that the cops had an enormous loss in one inning and all of the games they had gained out of all those other years they gave back in one year folks that is what you're\nBeing tossed into doing in your portfolio ... looking at the image rather than the game folks it's about some long play is about the game it's about not how much you lead but how much you kept ... challenging the status quo folks\nWho are you going to continue to challenge the status quo but stick around during the break we're going to be back in just a few minutes [noise]\n\nThe power to financial radio show to forget it you're just joining us haven't missed the thing you can get a pile of cash to the shows he can go to any time you were\nLike this website has some W. I. V. A. dot com peace ... Madison dot com or\nSunday I hurt radio half you can be listening to us live right now\nOn the radio channel or peace channel set of course the Pasha s just typing in power financial and you can do the show the other\nShows as well so we continue on this busy Saturday yeah I\nI Do and I want to start off with a disclaimer right away because I realize you know when we talked about numbers in the last segment\nI what I don't want to do is make people think that I Know beyond a shadow of a down or anything like that or promise\nThat in the next ten years or Twenty years we know exactly what's going to happen with any of those returns I'm not into any of the strategies or any of the strategies so I I Want to be careful about that right past performance is no guarantee a future that returns ads exactly right but what I Do want you to understand folks\nIs that you don't have to do by the status quo you can challenge the status quo\nYou don't have to do with everybody else is doing you can play long ball so often this thought of buying and hold strategies you know be very passive by which are into and hang onto it for ... you know all these years\nIt it's very interesting because uh well number one we know it doesn't work long term in it does work at periods of time it works when the market's doing really well\nBut if you don't make changes when the market goes down what you went up with will be taken away right\nSo I Want to go back though to this idea about challenging the status quo with these strategies I Want to kind of give you an example of what has happened over the past and how it's realized\nNot again we're not promising we know this is what's gonna happen in the future we're not saying we know we'll do you know the city kind of results\nGoing for just looking at the past that's all we're doing and we're trying to get an understanding of the concepts to challenge the status quo how you manage risk so these strategies are designed to try to take advantage of opportunities when the market gives them\nBought move away from those risks when the market is taking it away so let me give me an example here is a strategy that has that being used that over the last ten years so if you were to\nHave a hundred thousand dollars to start with over the last ten years you have some ... five hundred if you had a hundred percent in the stock market\nOver the last ten years starting with a hundred thousand dollars\nFrom a two thousand and seven sorry two thousand and me through two thousand Seventeen\nYou'd have ended up with about a hundred and eighty five thousand dollars came up and you know some money people always say the market always goes up it lacks right okay so now that's a risk or of Seventy one for example\nBut I can show you a strategy that over the last ten years that had a risk or a forty for example\nThat you end up with how much\nWell I think you end up with about two hundred and two\nHow about that so you took less risk\nAnd you end up with two hundred and two thousand versus a hundred and eighty five what beat that's not a big deal All right but that's after she is just so you know that's that's after you've paid all the fees to the to the people managing the money and all that kinda stuff\nAnd you took just over half half the risk now here's the kicker because up talking all these numbers now let's put the understanding behind it what was this portfolios drawn down in two thousand eight well we know that the markets drawdown was a minus fifty one\nThis strategies drawdown was a little over a minus eight\nThat's it now and again I'm going to emphasize that\nI'm not telling you I Know the next drawing down that that strategy will only have a minus eight I don't know whether it will be there might be a minus ten it might be a minus fifty and it might even be a minus twenty but I Know this that if that strategy hits a minus twenty what do you think the market's doing during that time frame right\nTheir strategy is designed to avoid the drawdown\nSo Pete I I Know a lot of our listeners right now probably scratching their head thinking out in the world does that work and why haven't I heard about that before but\nI'll tell you why because Wall Street once you invested all the time that's why they focus on the evenings and it is to Wall Street and advisors advantage\nTo focus on the any rather than the game itself because they can win an Emmy they can get you focused on the here and now rather than what is really truly your long term gains now let me also just qualified as\nWe don't put everything in the market for obvious reasons we could be wrong that money still can live with those strategies can still lose money they have lost money they have lost money and they don't want to have wrong timing and they'll do it at the wrong time\nAnd the status quo is that Wall Street is set up for Wall Street now\nThe reality is there's multiple places people put their money right people put their money on Wall street people put their money on the banks people put money into insurance products\nSo we have to be careful no matter what round we're working in whether we're working on or you have somebody working on your behalf or the working on their own behalf or their companies beehive or their broker dealers behalf that makes sense yeah that makes sense okay so now think about this as a fiduciary\nWe are challenging the status quo you often also think of a people here for this year and they say well they're just in investments right\nYeah I Want you ingest imbalance of my my new advisory told me he was a Fidesz Sherry and he told me doesn't take commissions and my investments and um and I gave them some of my money and we got an invested it was great\nSo there's your example All right here's the thing we asked for it\nThis year he's also do because we do complete planning right we're doing panorama claiming you might say to me Pete you often talk about principle protected products that are not in the market and I would say you're right and then they would say but\nYou're selling me on the fact that Europe for this year and my answer to you is you're absolutely right how can I be for this Sherrie when I'm not able to look at the broad based planning that you mean for retirement\nMost for their shares are just looking at the investments\nWe're here to tell you challenge your status quo look broader base let's give you some facts to back this up for a moment\nSo you can understand what I'm saying then reach ... what's the percent ... from one to a hundred what's the percentage chance what's the chance that your house would burn down\n... three percent three percent\nRight now folks are listening to me you have a three percent chance your house could burn down those are the statistics may have homeowner's insurance of course be of course I mean number one if you got a mortgage it's it's mandatory right but you why do you have insurance on your house\nHave you not seen all the flooding recently yeah I mean ... you know ... years yeah I mean okay you've got to protect it All right so now let's go to if you're driving down the road\nIn your car gets totaled what are the percent what's the chance that you are in a car accident and your car gets told\nPete it's got to be\nIt's got it's got to be kind of low it I don't think it happens too often um I must say Eighteen percent\nThere that are on can you tell he knows the numbers right Eighteen percent that's the reality when you are talking about getting a car total there is an Eighteen percent chance that you're given a car accident in your cars told now\nYou know how homeowner's insurance I Do have homeowners and enter you have automobile insurance of automobile insurance I even have an umbrella policy in case I Need extra in charge now you're talking\nLike if it is Sherry so now let me challenger was long lasting when it comes to retirement what's your biggest asset most people would say it's their retirement accounts right have you ensure a dream come\nDo you know what the chances are of or if it wasn't even step back for a moment what about long term care what are the percentages of somebody really long term care\nCare going in a nursing home or assisted living or having a home health care person themselves you know what\nThose numbers are what the percentages believe it's Seventy Seventy two percent Seventy two percent of the two\nPercent and yet I hear people tell me all the time well we're just going to self insure we don't think it's going to happen the kids are going to take care of us you can go on and on and on Seventy two percent chance\nDo people automatically ensure against that the answer is no should they yes what about running out of money on retirement right our biggest asset going into retirement is our money right what's really your health but that's a whole nother subject\nThe fact is that according to government statistics ... percent of people will run out of money in retirement eighty three percent\nThat's a big number it's a big number and it's up to ... that means I have to work with insurance products because people mean to ensure their lives than you do insure against long term care they need to ensure their income\nWell it would be a disservice if you're not protecting them against one of the biggest threats that's there there are multiple big threats you mentioned long term care that's a big threat no one talks about in a bigger threat and we're going to wrap\nUp on this has longevity people are living longer they're living longer outliving their money folks you don't have to live with a lot of your money there's no into in today's world you don't have to have big chunks of money lost out of your portfolio you can manage these things but you know what happens you have to challenge the status quo\nYou have to challenge the status quo and you do that right now by pick them up that phone and given us a call at six or eight to one to seven three zero zero six or eight\nTo one to Seventy three hundred it's just for the first five dollars a call during the show get complimentary visit come with us they get to some of our staff get to see his face to face and you're not going to get a call back until Monday right\nCorrect and folks will only meet with new clients

folks listen we're wrapping up the show you tell I'm passionate about this subject um we got to get a new soap box over here [laughter]\nBut the reality is folks it is time to challenge the status quo for retirement we've been doing it on the show for years now\nPeople love apple products why because they're you know we were talking about rent when we're off right there and let me real quickly as we're wrapping up let me tell you my story real fast because you know I'm like everybody else I'm like ha ha yeah right it's really that big of a difference\nAnd then what happens is that by an iPhone

right I mean it and it's so specific to your situation because it depends on your expenses and your lifestyle and your your expected lifestyle or there's lots of generic benchmarks what I can tell you is that the majority of people are under prepared for retirement and in fact\nFor the most part we have a crisis in America of people not being prepared for retirement especially if we look at the broad\nStatistics which are a little frightening and I I don't even know that I Believe all of them but uh you know some of the broader statistics tell us the fifty percent of Americans haven't even save one single penny oh gosh a national statistics will tell you that the average retirement account for those who have saved as is less than a hundred thousand dollars\nA a what I can tell you what I just posted on our Facebook page and by the way if you're not following my Facebook I Would encourage you to do so it's a retirement income strategies on Facebook\nOr we always post a lot of good a relevant information and sometimes it's just a you know for good good laugh I we do a friday funny piece which really sometimes has nothing to do is find him\nBut I posted a piece from CNBC which is really interesting and it was the you know the age old question as a million dollars enough\nBut the specificity of this article was they broke down state by state and here's what I'll tell you in the state of Wisconsin the average couple\nWith average expenses a million dollars would last you Twenty one years okay and so for many people that's not enough right yeah I retire at sixty that means I'm I'm going to pass away at age eighty one and quite frankly are life expectancy is probably age eighty seven in eighty four\nIn and by the way fifty percent of people live longer than life expectancy but but that question Janice is how much do I need that that's the question that's what you need a retirement advisor to help you with and that's why I Need to collect so much valuable information and the most important thing is your budget\n... but I don't want the gases I don't want you to gas on what you spent I Want you to look at your bank accounts and telling me precisely\nWhat you've been spending because you're going to need to replace\nAbout eighty percent of your your pre retirement income\nI'm no that's definitely a an average right and it's it's one of those again statistics but let me explain that eighty percent rule if you've done things right and you get into retirement that the only expenses for the most part that are going away are your mortgage or mortgages paid off there's no more no more mortgage payment\nAnd you're no longer working so so that money going into your retirement account and let's say that that was Fifteen to twenty percent\nHowever another year retired it's Saturday seven days a week\nAnd if you look at your expenses you'll probably agree with me that you spend more money on Saturday than you do the other six days of the week yeah we do\nAnd not only that Gen but you don't want to just sit around watching Gunsmoke reruns throughout your retirement you want to do something right you want to go to lunch you want to maybe take a trip once a year I don't know a vacation and these things cost money quite frankly many people will spend more on their annual vacation than they were putting into their retirement account\nSo eighty percent of your pre retirement income might not even be enough but but we can tell you we have tools designed to tell you how much money you're going to need and how long it's going to last you based on uh the various things and obviously some of it as inflation which we don't know exactly\nChristian when we talk about longevity factoring into figuring out how much you're going to need to save for retirement let me point out some other statistics about longevity\nI think it's eighty percent of men die married but eighty percent of women die single because women tend to outlive their husbands\nAnd you know Christian many women are in charge of the finances and their family they pay the bills they buy the groceries managed the checkbook but that doesn't mean they're going to be set from an income standpoint going into retirement so can you talk about what's what's still missing\nYeah that's a fact and it's something that I'm super passionate about Gen in fact we refused to hold a second visit if unless both parties of the relationship for our president ... because for whatever reason and by the way that statistic was new to me I appreciate you sharing that I didn't know that eighty percent of women die single that is fascinating to me\nHere's what I Know I Know that that overwhelmingly us men die die sooner and and that that many women are left behind in in a tougher financial position and and and I believe it's our obligation as men to take care of our wives and and I mean we could argue that why should take care of husbands as well which I don't disagree with but\nBut because us men don't typically live as long as our wives we have to understand the financial impact of of passing away before that person and there's a there's a big impact\nA number one you're going to lose one of the to Social Security check so the income is automatically lower number two the surviving spouse is now a single tax Feiler\nSingle person pay more money on taxes\nAnd they have less exemptions into ... so from just appear tax perspective that could be a Fifteen to thirty percent impact\nSo you're paying more taxes on less income and here's the shocking thing\nA lot of times that the surviving spouse spends more money\nWhen you're not here certainly if it's the women who outlive the man because the last place many of these widows want to be as at home in an empty house yes they want to be out with their girlfriends and their grandchildren and buying gifts and having lunch and playing bridge and taking vacations\nThey don't want to be at home so often\nWe see a a triple threat we see less income more taxes and more spending and so this is why it is so important to meet with an advisor with both people to fully grasp\nYour financial situation a Gen I was just sharing with my team this last week on a first visit that I had and I like I said we require both people to be there\nBut but I get it if you're listening right now I understand that sometimes the the the husband wants nothing to do with the finances or or maybe the wife wants nothing to do in fact some some of the the wives listening it it would probably you blackout five seconds into the conversation 'cause it just doesn't excite you and I understand and appreciate that\nTo be very conservative on your behalf and to plan for the worst and there's a lot of things out there that can go wrong but for the most part we want to hope for the best\nAnd that's why this customers Asian is so important because I Want to build a plan that his customized specifically to your situation that that again plans for the worst but hopes for the best\nChristian ... is the Madison money guy I'm generally jak alongside in Studio ... spin the last few minutes talking about that process Christian this isn't something where something we talk about today resonates with a listener they call they come in and you shove a bunch of brochures over at them\nThis is a multi meeting process you really take the time to get to know them to figure out if this is even out of work before you start trying to help the map out a plan for the future can you talk about that\nYeah totally I ... at the end of the day the most important things are we even a good fit for each other and in in in full disclosure a lot of folks are not a great fit for us in what we do and and when we are selective on the families that we choose to partner with because\nThere's just not enough time in the day and guys and full disclosure I'm a recovering broker I worked at one of the largest companies in America and and I'm here to tell you that for most of these companies if you can fog Amir and you've got twenty five bucks in your wallet\nYou become a client and that's just not our process at all again we worked like a doctor's office so you as you said John it's they multiply visit process week it's a it's a specifically designed client engagement process and it's really designed to slow things down\nAnd to address your concerns and allow for you to only have to make one decision every time we meet and our first visit is really just about getting to know each other\nI'm going to ask you all kinds of questions and you have permission to ask me all kinds of questions\nAnd most importantly I Want to find out what concerns you and what you want to have happened then I'm going to take all your financial information and that that everything in your financial life so here's the deal folks you're going to have a lot of homework to do for our first visit and I know that this is different we we get a lot of people that call us back down and they're like holy moly\nThis is going to take me forever to do I've never had to do this while I understand but you've never been retiring either\nAnd so we're going to ask you to do a lot of stuff we're going to want to see your budget we're going to ask you to bring in your tax returns and all of your insurance statements and\nAnd by the way I'll tell you that many families just from the process of doing that they're already ten times better than they were because most people don't or anything of that and so in fact I've had a lot of really positive feedback just from the act of gathering everything for my first visit\nBut Gen we are going to take that stuff back to our financial lab we're going to crunch the numbers and we're going to get back together for our second visit and we're going to teach you what's happening in your current financial plan and we're going to educate you on what you currently have and I'm going to look for problems based on what you told me\nAnd we hope you have enough information and that second visit again to answer to questions make one decision number one do you agree with the problems that we've identified and are these problems that you want to fix or are you OK ignoring [noise]\nAnd then of course the decision is if if we both think that it's a good fit do we partner together and become client and adviser and if the answer is yes then only then do we get into the third visit\nAnd that's a separate visit and that's when we start constructing were reconstructing\nFor many of you this this retirement portfolio\nAnd the whole purpose of that is to fix the problem [noise]\nBut ... year point this is a mall die appointment process designed to be custom to your situation\nAnd we

democracy ... inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nAnd you know we just got talking about that and why we find that and you know the the science is now there and I think they ... really broken down and give us some good ideas\nYou know the the current concern I have is you know I can I can tie into a house that's Twenty years old and find those problems which in a lifetime of a house Twenty years like I you know out east there were not houses that are four or five hundred years old and these things are fine structurally they're not they don't ... ... um\nThat doesn't mean they are tight and don't have moisture coming into um sometimes water coming into him\nIt's just that those houses are are breathing you know maybe a little too much it's costing the sheer urban heat 'em but you know we don't really want that either but um you know I I've found that we need to try and you open up a a two hundred year old Madison house\nA pill the plaster often in a nice bright sunny day you can see like light coming through the others in holes and\nBut but you don't find right like this is great you find this newer house that you know as insulated it's you know and and and you find right and you know it just it was just confirmed some things that that I felt you know okay we\nWe I don't know if you can stop completely moisture for coming in the house now you may say why is that right yes crazy you know you've you've seen the tide back on houses that house wrap\nThat makes you feel like you're you know I'm not saying they're doing a bad thing with the ... not bad you need something um you know out there but really um what they got me to do is start looking at a house more like that citing that's on the outside really is just something to keep UV light off the house like a real houses armies that citing right\nAnd so\nUh what what kind of amount of two was OK let's figure out how to stop infiltration\nUm and I mean like you know okay let's we if we want to have water stopped coming in that's one thing right but if we if air is still in Illinois infiltrating you know if you have ... negative pressure in his house in the air is still getting in it's bringing moisture with it if that goes into our house that now is super insulated like just about every house rebuild\nThat inflation can trap that moisture and where's it going how's it gonna drought cycles of drought mhm that's gonna create right on so\nThat was in that ... and that was kind of what I was thinking what his what when you were mentioning you know some of the route of Michael where is this if we're if what's the problem is and it's there's nothing to dry\nSo I've got to ask what are we learning what are we kind of all\nI'm so I don't know if you've heard of like um like a lot of lot of people maybe you've heard of its ... Oh yes yeah it's basically like in our terminology we call it appealing stick and um [noise] it's on top it's this kind of rubber I star and then it's real sticky are nice you peel off the plastic and it sticks to the rough\nWell there's the you know the last um big project that we did involved um a lotta refer pair\nWe used a new generation of ... is blue\nIt was really when I got the bill I almost had a heart attack because I Know this year [laughter] but um you know I I got to talk to that company and you know they explained to me what it's doing and why it's more expensive and I want you know what this is like as a exactly the way to go\nA wind up doing a whole room for that and we just didn't it was all her house and we just didn't want the risk of any [noise]\nYou know trying to stop infiltration of any kind [noise] um and it was just a great product they they're actually kind of this new ideas to actually appeal and stuck the outside of the house so instead of maybe that Tyvek Claire you're actually doing a\nUm [noise] this pill and stick those rubber ice layer around the whole lights outside your house I mean you can run ... um it'll hold water I mean have you you know it they will not leak [noise]\nUm so basically we're stopping infiltration and actually you can laugh at some of these products down on your foundation so it's it's one continuous\nA membrane a there are also some I don't know how to describe these [noise]\nI'm kind of a kind of a it's a liquid\nOr you can actually paint on so you as you say you're using appealing steak when you get her on a window and you're having trouble making the transition like there's not a great product there you can actually use a it's a two part solution paint this thing out and creates its own Marlboros memory and there's a lot of technology coming out with this\nUm you know in the mid west of I built my own house right now I I probably would use plywood not the not the U.S be where I think it's I think it's I think it's better\nAnd can stand moisture better doesn't rot like the lowest be does [noise] um I I'd I'd be really tempted to use that feeling sick and then I probably put form on the outside because he we're back to his building science of\nI Want to break the cold outside of my house not in my wall and so phone bill is to plywood you know and then a fiberglass insulation\nIs is this stuff is as part of our ugly if you're doing some remodeling has to step tie in with the existing um structure like let's say you're having certain areas of the house done can you tied in are\nVery much so we've done we've talked some about uh you know we used quite a bit of the spray on close cell phone ... and a lot of times we'll do we just call it a skin layer so we're doing like a one inch layer on the on the you know in on the inside of the walls but on the on the back of the siding basically\nAnd so we're back to the sheeting and what we're doing is we're we're doing a couple of things we're trying to seal up all those little holes that you can see through\nAnd we're also trying to\nUm you know and and close el actually was will stop vapor or if it's ... you know if you have more than an inch on it so I'll stop water doesn't absorb water um which is is you know makes it a good product for here in the mid west when things get colder I think we're like\nI you know in my mind I go like a a a kind of this base number issue for like there's a lot of minutes ... now and states are requiring the sport or test um for building a house\nOr we're not quite there yet but it's um you know you'd see several buildings around town will blower test their houses um you know to get a Green Belt certification or something like that and a lot of members we worked for do that [noise]\nUm so that that normal that first number for us as around three so actually the three of seems to be like a common ... if you're a south you know where that they don't have a really a heat season\nThey're ... number might be five so it's much easier number to attain um you know three you got to be pretty good it's a fairly tight house which to me it seems a little surprising like that ... that like the average house goes through I mean a good house grows through three fold age or you know air changes in an hour by means infiltration is oh I'm In a house change [noise]\nUm so I met a guy out there is telling me about it and I'd seen this product at last year was build her show and what this is I don't know how to describe this it's kind of like a\nYou have these uh a fog or is they put in a house\nThat basically fog out this microscopic latex caulk I Will just call it that for [laughter] but it's sort of ... that looks like smoke is so thin\nAnd what you do is you turn the board or around and pressurize the house so it's now instead of making a vacuum to measure how much air is coming into the house you're actually pressurized and you're trying to get here to go out every little curtain looking cranny and your fog this stuff in there and takes about Ninety minutes and it will fill up to a half inch hole oh [noise] so\nYeah and our Zach in ... it'll go find every little spot that you know is a pinhole from a pinhole to you know a half inch and it'll it is amazing so I saw the demonstration they they actually drill and a half inch hole in a in a piece of plywood\nAnd it didn't get any of this stuff outside of the whole it's just like as soon as it fills the whole it basically just you know as soon as this area that are so yeah\nSo that it took about Ninety minutes this was on a house that tested one already so it was a very well build house um\nYou know even getting into one is pretty tough I mean they had to do a bunch of stuff um they did that foaming skim ... they had a you know the the the uh the memory and on the outside of the ... they had for the top but they did everything right [noise]\nUm that had blown and insulation that cavity still store at one\nUh which is amazing um after this thing they were down to point three which is a phenomenal number\nSo you know his point was listen I'm you have to either make it tight or let it all out you know I have to be able to see through it and have an old healthy house 'cause really a house that you know has a lot of changes is going to be a fairly nice ... I mean yeah it's going to cost you a lot he didn't do that but [noise]\nBut you get a lot of fresh air right so if you really tightened up the house you have to you have to deal with that too you gotta you gotta really control there that's in the house\nUm would get my attention was them talking about okay you're thinking Texas yeah well they don't have some of the things we have to deal with but they have a lot a lot of pollen a lot of dust\nAnd so you know to to really monitor that indoor air quality they're doing some things on their heating system which were were actually start you know monitoring up here and talking to our home when I was about [noise]\nBut um the whole idea of you know okay when that when that airs coming in from the outside it's not just cold and and and um you know country money on yeah right it's also bringing moisture with it but you know just called vapor\nI'm so vapor usually is coming in in a small league you know small early but it's bringing that moisture I talked about which that's going to get into your inflation and maybe costs ...\nUm it's also bringing some nasty stuff where they might be bringing you know pollen and mold spores and who and who knows whatever else so I I think like I said it's it's the whole thing you've got to worry about the whole thing this this fog and things are there's only one\nCompany in the country that's doing it there Oh hi [laughter] uh they went down to Texas in the house for a friend of mine um and and did an amazing job is not ridiculously expensive is just like a you know its in its infancy so\nIt's it's interesting too when you were mentioning kind of um\nYou know either either sealed you know you want your house me they're very sealed sealed very well or you know or legal is is I think a lot of times we forget is is in some of these were almost creating the ideal environment for the stuffed it to grow with ... yeah\nYou bet and you know I'm not the same kind of got my attention and it really got me thinking about this was um you know if you look at the stats on you know I don't know if a\nHundred percent correlates but it made sense to me the stats on from when we in the U.S really started to you know the heavily and slate in the fifties\nThat's really one of the problem started cause you know like I'm from asthma allergies to and it is exponentially grown and it does make you wonder if our indoor air quality is is the issue you know if we're\nIf we're bringing vapor in that house pretty tight house can still league vapor and if that grace moisture inside role at the you know that's a good spot to get some old and that's going to work its way in does is this affecting all of us\nBut I think a lot of us got a firsthand look at what the moisture and humidity does get a little mushroom growing in the ...\nThose kinda things you know this year yeah you definitely want to keep\nThose spores that others all the junk outside of your own talking with my two ... owner of edge construction of course they bring you the home remodeling show right here on Thirteen ten W. I. B. A. talking with Mike about his trip\nTo Baltimore for the national remodeling show some of the great things that ah that day he's bringing back here to the Madison and a Dane County area\nOf course talking a lot about building science we'll continue our conversation with Mike of course don't forget about ... construction website edge construction company dot com and their telephone number six three ... three three ... three that number six and three six edge this is the home remodeling shell brought by ... construction right here Thirteen den WNBA\nOnly show with Haitian instruction email your questions ... construction radio and Jean ... wants to hear Sean ... news talk through it in W. I. V. A. remodeling\nShow brought you buy edge construction on line edge construction company dot com telephone number six three six three three for three that six three six edge\nFor edge construction again the website ... construction company ... Mike ... joining us the owner of edge construction as he does every Saturday for the home remodeling show um let's talk to a Mike is is we're kind of wrapping up or the trip out to Baltimore stuffy learn what was interesting is when you were talking\nAbout Baltimore remember a couple of years ago or maybe last year you had taken a trip to Ireland actually took a vacation which\nWith [laughter] memorable in it so anyway we highlight shows highly as living now than I and I enjoyed myself yeah has like a like a nice to have to like I I'm an adult men [laughter] I don't why and what you were still kind of working because you came back he said what did you say about the houses\nThere oh my gosh like a five hundred year old house the Ireland then it's like a baby [laughter] um and you know you you you know we were joking around about it but um [noise]\nYou know the the the housing in Europe really are built to last aren't there they tend to not be in this race thing quite like we don't know if I could for myself down as much as they do but\nThey're um because they're you know I saw some houses that are in construction and and their technique is not a lot different than it was probably a hundred years ago two hundred years ago [noise]\nThey're building these walls you know three feet thick alive as stone and stucco and and things and uh you know they take their time like a\nFifteen hundred square foot house be pretty good size over there I Would think there's a lot of them that are quite a bit smaller than that and they they they\nIt takes to rebuild it I think it's got what about the pay is set up but\nUm [noise] but um what their bill in is something that man you you can knock it down with a truck I mean it's you know it's starts with a black wall stone goes on top of that ... there might be somewhat framing insulation but the the houses are there tight ... really strong well built\nAnd nothing like I say that that's what's I think of the interesting thing about it is\nUm ... you've talked we talk a little on the show but also on the show you've talked about you know when you're finding some of these even on some of the whole was that you guys have been in that are that are newer is some questions about\nWhat about that call you're kind of seeing some of the stuff going in and just kind of the industry standard of what constitutes new construction concerns about the longevity of that quality\nRight I mean like uh I I Would be ... Supreme let a press of a house I built you know if I didn't feel at house could last you know for ever I mean like several hundred years I I don't think a three hundred year laws should really be I mean I think that should be easy to build now building with\nAnd we're not talking about stone and [laughter] you know black\nWe're talking about you know today's product but fast growth lumber and then I think okay we need to protect the stuff you know we like we talked about\nThose people in the sticks and really stopping infiltration so that we don't have you know if if moisture doesn't make it in the wall either by just run through a window or or come in with you know a little bit of vapor\nThen it doesn't need to dry out like if you don't have a problem to start with you don't have a you don't have to worry about it um so am\nI think that's why some of this conversation needs to be had and why it's so important you know you said he taught the longevity that that you know and and I was kind of seen it you know like before the housing bubble you know four or five\nI think it was down to like the average person said in a house like five years six years sober do you really worry about quality to worry about 'em you know right you're not you're not thinking that and\nThey want a fix everything they they've heard their whole life you have to fix it you have to make it better than a so there there I Would say it'd be more unusual for them to to not leave something because even if we're not getting paid to do it they're probably fixing it because it's you know it's just part of the deal\nAnd some of that too is you know if if you're leaving it there's a chance that susceptible to an issue down there on the phone's gonna ring and say hey you know\nGoing back out either um you know we've talked some some you know like I always think if I was a horror and say well okay this is a construction area in my house how are you going to treat the rest of it yeah and then I'd be crying I Know\nYou guys who were actually gonna let's let's talk a little bit about that in the next thing because I Want to find out from you guys that I Know the answer to all this stuff but it it is an important question asking an important thing to to understand talking with Mike ... owner of age construction company can find them on line edge construction company dot cop telephone number six three six\nThree three ... three that number six three six edge go back with my could just talk a little bit about what they do for the rest of your house while they're doing some of that remodeling in certain areas we'll find out from Mike how that's handled ... with that construction continues right here Thirteen den WNBA\nTake home remodeling show with age construction continues now on news talk Thirteen test your YV a solver modeling\nShell brought you buy edge construction hanging out this morning with my two week owner of edge construction forget about the website edge construction company dot com they're telephone number six three six\nThree three for three that six three six edge but talking a lot about quality on this program and uh one of the things to the Mike that we just kind of touched down before the break is not only the area and and and ... you know controlling the environment where you are working\nThere's a whole house there and a lot of times people don't always think about that and you guys put in pretty stringent controls that to keep the\nThing the glass stray cat did you get a lot of techniques and\nTools running ideally you would want to separate you know it works best when you can separate the construction area from the the rest of the house yeah\nAnd it's an awful lot of times you know we we can have a pathway through the garage or maybe the front door to the construction area and we can put up um you know the the fabric walls and the you know the present them you can get you can get through if you want to but we really want to create a different environment in that in that construction space from\nYou know we use the the ... and we talked about that now we have actually a few different sizes of those\nAnd you can actually duct that you know pulling in the middle of a room or you're doing work\nAnd it takes the dust out of the air it's a pretty phenomenal you know a lot of those are ... thousand sea FM which means they're they're cleaning you know a thousand cubic feet per minute really move a lot of air and you know the ... best actually when you were caught flat Dr Blass dislike of plastic I don't know

river\nAnd it's amazing\nHow honest if is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country\nIt is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than the furor trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously have\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never\nI had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes rebuilt\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go\nBack to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that and it remains so today\nIt's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them in a thing for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watch this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how blazing lay on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected by life to him everybody's a bad\nGuy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides his journal is is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not\nYour job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nA cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister\nAnd a cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and what\nIn the primary I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kinds of personalities you would have to be if your job\nIs destroying people no conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen nobody's decent nobody's white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor now I imagine real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much\nUh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pizza file story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the\nGuts to run it until the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about me to move out here that would put the same thing I'm so the name of it is ... I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um\nIt's runs cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix Amazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here\nAnd if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's a it's hit everybody everybody as a rubber rape including the people at the papers the reporters I I have to admit I was so [noise]\nAnyway here's Donna Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place she's with Bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed and remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho so the DNC the Democratic party who\nIn hurting normal countenance would be out there so oh yeah blue wave Democrat's gonna win band gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she sounds\nSee how many days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens right we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials want on the millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get a paint way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today what would I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so what would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why she's saying that\nWell because she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it turns out Latinos are far more supportive of Trump Republicans than anybody know according to recent polling data\nThat Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is\nThere is so much excitement there are so much motivation there so much just ... nothing can hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried\nThey're worried that something that's not a blue wave may be shaping up here that's what this headline is certainly they over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat GOP voter registration at the same level\nAs past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four team to twenty sixteen but activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put these numbers in that context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include a complete picture\nOf registration in front of those years\nWhereas the Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what that's all you need if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered from time to vote so it's that\nSeems like a little ... well we don't have a full database or numbers for two thousand I said well you've got enough to know\nSo how can this be health in voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull\nTrying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore what may give them a card all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats\nIs saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man\nAnd now she's warning the Democrats to stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masks back on your Democrats have got to read camouflage yourself she warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda\nOf course we should fight massage and racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions Democrats can't answer them without first getting into power she's saying these shot up stop\nYour your your
