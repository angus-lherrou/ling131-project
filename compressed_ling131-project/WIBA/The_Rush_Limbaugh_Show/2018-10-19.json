behind\nA ride with a Trump\nIs absolutely a referendum on Trump is policies and as you could see no Republicans are smart enough to talk about the economy because Trump's big mouth behind can't get out of his own way and so they spent time depending what she says the defending what he does\nI mean there's ... there's the the the this American ... who's missing this journalist be cute and for

I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night\nWho just beside themselves over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York the liberal by the way\nHe reformed about Twenty years ago he can't he can't he's having\nTrouble dealing with the possibility that the Democrats might win the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that a majority American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely doesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves and link Kavanaugh's situation but that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system to fix\nWhatever problems they have the or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument for the purpose of government\nIt really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking that government\nIs the solution and the solution is not really a solution the solution at the Democratic voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana is why when we want that\nTo try amp\nWhat we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by isn't concerned it's an open an opportunity to blast theme Trump\nTo damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump the cave and abandoned Saudi Arabia\nNot it's if it's not that the drive by have anything on that Saudi Arabia is just to get Trump the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump\nInto going against his instincts they've been trying to do that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made their die\nTo be able to say they pressure Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because he's afraid\nOf them and they think they're getting close when Trump's out there saying yeah it looks like a show ... died looks like it's a pretty good rep to show me what\nThey think they're getting close and they're all jammed up on their own tree then they're all getting more jazz\n[noise] for this that's why we tells you hope to show is not because anybody thinks he deserves to die but the media never tells you the truth about anything not anymore not work concerns Trump\nHow many of you think let me just ask you a question remembered this faceless nameless on non ... op ed\nThat ran in the New York times supposedly written by somebody in the Trump inner circle in the west wing talking about how bad it is in there how dangerous lead childish an immature\nTrump is how unprepared how ill equipped how in competent how at risk we all are but then we were assured\nBy whoever wrote this thing don't worry there are adults like us that are protecting this country from President Trump and you can count on us to commit well everyone is who is this who wrote this and they began circulating names do you notice we don't have an identity yet\n\nNot possible not possible that whoever wrote this has not been out that after all this many weeks not possible not possible that the person who wrote it\nHas an out of him or herself for the fame alone for me the accolades alone another thing why has it been forgotten\nI mean it's still a pretty damn big deal that there's that kind of a traitor inside the west wing why is it been forgotten because it didn't work that's why they're on the other things have you noticed there's no news about Russian collusion\nYou notice that why is that\n'cause it's not a big deal to people getting ready to vote it's not and if you on which people's votes will turn that's why the media dropped it\nThey try to make it the issue they did everything they can to make Russian collusion and Trump did it the issue for two and a half years here we are already in the mid terms or just a little over two weeks away not worried about other than this mall or report supposedly be out\nThere but now Valerie Jarrett daughter who is a reporter at at CNN no bias there\nValerie Jarrett daughters is going to get this calmed down the Mueller investigation is not over it's going to be going on long after the midterms\nReally well then why a leak that Mueller has about wrapped it up and his reports ready to go\nBecause as somebody pointed out yesterday or maybe it was not as it was something else somebody ... what are the odds that between now and election day the New York times is going to have some story supposedly containing nuts and bolts details of the smaller report\nIt will be anonymously written or anonymously sourced I don't I don't think you should discount that possibility at all\nThe issues that matter the issue is that our polling right now and the issues that are mattering in terms of people voting are what\nImmigration immigration caravan immigration and health care\n\nHappen to be the two primary issues Democrats\nThere is no laughter there's no enjoyment that why don't we want to winning\nTaking them and they rely on mountain\nNow think about how good it makes them feel that you depend on them because one of the world and they tell him to be independent and didn't make it\nOn her own the

Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not if they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular order hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward that was a tool for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career\nHis past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do Christie in Boise for Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael I have a nominee who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue\nThat was after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and where is he now\nAnd where is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people high school and college students that had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the in Iraq where\nIs that the day what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issues\nBased on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's during the ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David ... did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal ... these people do not have\nConnections with an audience they don't have connections with voters like Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming will miss hog women we want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nNew York post just published headline migrant caravan heading for us turns around and Mexico you've seen this anywhere else\nI have it's not on drugs yeah uh so I I report this to you with a little bit of caution a caravan of Honduran Mike written ... turned around today a day after reaching the magical wipe them out of border according\nTo a report what's The Simpsons poster poster\nIt's an ape piece story the or support thousand migrants fled their lives in poverty and violence in the Central American country with the hope to make if they were ... nothing about this is organic you know Trump's right to ask who's paying for this who is mine food\nWho is buying the water and distributing and who's paying for the gasoline for the vehicles being used\nWhere are these people are taking care of hide Gemini\nRequirements for those of us real into where they pulled me we've seen him and\nGet a port a potties trailing along in the ... all of this stuff has to be accounted for you're going to bring forth thousand people\nGot to eat they got to drink\nThey've got to have some shelter at some point who is\nBehind this and we're going to find out we're going to find out what the thing about this I'm I'm trying to when I openly speculated about this yesterday somebody on the Democrats' side wants this to happen\nI'm trying to figure out how this caravan let's say they get to the border and storm the border and just run across with how they think that helps the Democrats unless it's just the pictures of chaos they think they're going to redound negatively the Trump anyway\nOkay I Walk I promise I promise soundbites on your phone calls are coming up after this break I\nWho forgotten a company where you're ripping fighting got her ex ... luckily on ... and ...

costs so much for oh yeah oh yeah we\nThat's right because we ... we the eight hundred number didn't apply their cell phones cell phone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back ... back you go I\nI've been way back before that even so ah but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nLast two years there's only one thing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and they emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nA that it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does\nNot have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these are one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAs all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they see that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding his own with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people at Trump therefore as ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nMy question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he has promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly right\nAnd right there that was four in the Trump supporters\nThat we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that leaders in both parties do not want that ball\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment\nThe swamp on that they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut many of the ... the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was not to be a garner a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think\nFirst it's certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it\nIt that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because of the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\n[noise] and it's been a slow\nReversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans that Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side but\nWe'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay or is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon and Mohammed bin

mine was one of us and it was during the times and Dr ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how\nTrump separating families children from their mothers ads\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff's as Russia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for the rest of the pictures look bad we've got to do something pictures Louis oh my gosh\nI I was on the guy was smart enough to know that he was falling for a media trick but at the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this\nI have people complain to me about Trump's separating here I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures so that's the one thing that has had legs\nOkay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to half of them that are going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things that I don't know I just rely on hope which was the gang naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the\nIt hasn't been a ripe consistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity start this process if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the set of\nBecause I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... call cause death or talking ... famed Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment\nFans deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will add some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into these are scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't count those but I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seat there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place for Tony on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally abs and are there any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome out of their work and we know that\nThey know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six day and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election as you thousands sixteen the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are they now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and the lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats\nThat the justice associated with the Democrats are doing as landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a lead the balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued\nTo try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates\nThat ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomena the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat steam killed and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening\nPrecisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo far this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C living die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized\nAfter not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree very much I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think\nGenius L. dot com genius L. dot com\nBecause you can't always listening to morning honey and often gets records and you can't

happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white\nCollar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying one version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused\nOn doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were\nAmazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or anything about\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because I was working in January one or or or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day thing that that are right I just I just think it'd be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people the people would want but um\nWell don't won't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something to do you think that\nPeople need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or to doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small business there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well\nOkay I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that\nWeek and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally so don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... marched in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a brick that's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point is his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from it but that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen either done too much into a little\nTime oh I don't either get at the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose\nOf this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been in a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall but his\nPoint was how many continuing resolutions if we had independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "show_name":
