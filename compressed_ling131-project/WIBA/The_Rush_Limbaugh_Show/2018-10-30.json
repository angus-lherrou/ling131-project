all these people at the event last night it's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are

mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House and the first midterms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats vacated\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now his reelect and this is what the left and the drive by counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nBy a trumpet and Trump supporters so that could end up being a net positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over not blaming me we're back first

straight to the fourteenth amendment business here and the ending of birthright citizenship this is such a big deal a lot of people on the left will get to the audio of of me and others being blamed for all this and in due course I mean it's it's so old it's actually not news anymore and it's\nIt's it's really pathetic of these people on the left I get it all started with me being blamed the Oklahoma City bombing by Bill Clinton and it's just ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear\nThe now even though the government at the synagogue on Saturday in Pittsburgh was\nA guy David Trump the dry buys are trying to claim that Trump and me\nAnd mark Levin and Breitbart radicalized him we are responsible for this guy shooting

pathetic and it's all they've got and\nThey just they just keep at it even you know what when trying to blame me for for Timothy McVeigh shooting up near a building in Oklahoma City\nA back then by

I was ... I was livid and of course as a lone voice at the time I was a little alarmed can they make this that\nAnd of course they weren't able to and even now a certain members of the drive by caution

right that Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking so it blew up in their faces and this continues to too\nBut let's get the birthright citizenship this I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through\nOn one of the primary commitments they made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nApt to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country\nBut primarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws\nDefining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is\nIs under assault and the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrowing from the days of its founding out to the left America\nIs it legitimate to chip morals it's in the sun because we were a slave nation and we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers and their bunch of white privilege rich white

fourteenth amendment here [noise]\nBecause it's going to be relevant as the issue of goes forward [noise] again it was added after\nThe civil war its purpose was to overrule the Dred Scott decision which was a horrible Dred Scott sanction slavery Roger than it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy\nIt held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and passed the fourteenth amendment it guaranteed that freed slaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized in\nThe United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states added up a state where they reside which means the draft or is that the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happen to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent\nOf founding documents are so important quote\nThis meaning the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign\nMinisters it was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants there was an Eighteen\nEighty four case el versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject to tribal jurisdictions not us jurisdiction well an illegal alien here\nIs not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from that they're here illegally gas when this all changed\nIn the Nineteen sixties concomitant with Senator Kennedy\nWanting to re oh we had shut down all immigration from Twenty one sixty five along comes Senator Kennedy in a pre Chappaquiddick days wanting to reopen it for the express purpose of making sure the Democratic party always had a permanent underclass of voters dependent on them and the\nGovernment you are listening to Rush Limbaugh voice on the right ... ... feet Mitt for\nTwenty seven story ... weather's\nW

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who won in literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nYou watch and results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him have been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that are in junior high intramural football and soccer ball that nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down and we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election that is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened is not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as\nThey as they do and\nIt's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo look at some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling to news civility and alleged tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the drive by telling everybody we need to tone it down they told Trump you need to tone down their rhetoric dude you're causing all these people engage in violence Trump said I thought I had done to down if you need me to turn it back up I Will they went bonkers\nSo here comes the left wing billionaire Tom ...\nWho is one of these environmentalist wackos\nWho hopes to make a killing him this this fraudulent hoax of man made climate change\nDire is running a Facebook ad campaign comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein the ad features a three minute long video that accuses the president of following it dictator's playbook\nModeled by tyrants like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Kim Jong only in North Korea as well as Saddam Hussein they add describes Trump as a malignant narcissistic\nAnd claims he is perpetuating systemic\nMassage the video\nClaims that Trump's support for a border wall and attacks on the media make him comparable to dictators\n\nDictators not attacked the media they own the media\nDictators don't spend their time ripping the media because they are the media\nTrump visited dictator [noise] not even close to it\nSeems like only yesterday done at the drive buys are blasting Trump for tweeting that dire comes off as a craze stumbling alone [laughter] yet here he\nIs\nWashington Post yesterday Trump mocks Democrat mega donor Tom's dire the target of a pipe bomb and stumbling lunatic and now here comes Tom's dire bumbling along like a lunatic comparing Trump Trump to a bunch of tyrants\nJeff Flake said yesterday but it's on the line between Trump will change his rhetoric but elected officials should call him out\nAnd his supporters as being out of bounds you elected officials they'll continue to appear what the president and rallies where lock her up chants are encouraged and routine and phrases like the president is using I can imagine\nAs an elected official attending a rally like that and not stand up afterwards will be for him to say don't do this don't do this\nLake was on an Arizona NPR stations on Monday saying elected officials and got to abandon Trump Bill Nelson running for the Senate in Florida compares\nUs political climate\nRwanda before the genocide there\nStop the hey we must stop the violence we stopped\nAnd isn't that enter this was a great observation and you are making this is classic you have one guy who\nIs responsible for this he's mentally not write clearly off balance he does what he does and now all of you in Pittsburgh everybody we must come together we as do everybody living their lines cause this guy to lose it and go do what he did the\nRabbi of that synagogue is saying some of the most intelligent stuff of anybody a particularly in the heated passionate moment but yet that you're you're exactly right at a local media during the same\nLocal media is doing the same some of the national not local leaders are doing and why should anybody the guy who shot and they're not say anything about that guy\nWe we need to change [noise] I don't like being waiting for\nWhat do you think you need to do they have an order to prevent this from happening again what what do you Dave in Pittsburgh need to do to make sure that some other lunatic doesn't act like this\n[laughter] well I used to be an armed security office for many years ago\nNo now armed cancer you need to renounce Trump you need to renounce your support for Trump that's what they're trying to get you to do don't do it that's what they're trying to get you to do\nTime for ... years to get the recognition they deserve their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you

why the dot com\n\nAnd back to the phones we go this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\n... ... ... ... it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it\nYet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth unlimited abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors on foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back\nTo the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration\nFrom the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become\nAmericans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in ah in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there

with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and we had a far greater distribution of capitals that would be fine and dandy but the Arab man I don't make the solution to this is enterprise\nZones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis was an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's and [noise]\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones

I thought I saw\nAbout ... Michigan Militia shortwave radio not versus what the excuse was\nSo now that's become a me we have here is this a montage yep we got a bunch of CNN people and some National Review people\nUh radicalizing St ... saying Trump is radicalizing domestic terrorists just like ISIS listen to this\nWhat are we learning about how the Pittsburgh suspect was radicalized\nThese men appeared to have been radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized\nRadicalized people seeing what the president and a half a point and I thought they thanked\nWhether it's Sarah Huckabee or Donald Trump the half truth thing leads to people getting radicalized who is radicalizing people in America Donald Trump certainly a parent's responsibility\nFor the bomber was radicalized into sort of this Trump super fan community has radicalized so many more people than I Am very proud\nJulia I off there she is with the I guess the ... she pronounces you off his shoes GQ and I think she's a ... yes\nGQ writer Julia ... feet Trump is radicalized many more people\nThan ISIS she said that while I was a guest on CNN and then she apologizes for claiming Trump was radicalized more people than ISIS\nShe apologized to Monday shortly after claiming a on the air but Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS Twitter blow up after she made the comments section on that I used to be when Twitter blow up it\nWas all liberals that was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up ad leftists all over the place now\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Reince Priebus might shield\nAnd Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there is a direct connection between political speech and violence that's a very serious thing to do\nThe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask what radicalized than what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nAnd you cannot divorce the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat smacks boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to ask the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have an a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the ... so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this the moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being\nNobody on our side doing this is really did kill us\n\nIs the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they've been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so the Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you don't want to root it invokes it's rooted in the belief\nThat not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about everything one of the first criticisms of this program\nDating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I am your says Bengali and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because your too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you where to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nAll of us had been saying to each other\nBut you know we're not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dad or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto it not because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance\nDay in and day out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless that's been golly you can tell you how to think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window start shooting people and now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that keeps\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied your is the reason that this is all going 'cause you have the stupidity\nThank you so much for taking my call today ration thank you for all you can you bet\nI could find to make a quick point a hard left and the media and the freshly Hollywood and I think things have been engaging in gas sliding or the right\nWould you expect when you define that I hear so many people use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending there'd be defined\nOkay gas lighting and they're not common example is when I'm In a family they critical usually been by his trial in the family to take care of all of that they can ...\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about and they snare at then and especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make this entire narrative and what they believe Russia that that person is an idiot they're not evil\nNow I'm not seeing it all that every I'm liberal person is like that I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that a lack elevate people like this and I think the right type that shut them up\nAnd and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control he's on your side\nBut you can control the you elevate and I'm lying is perfectly fine if your gas lighting um and especially the dog whistle\nBecause you just imagine what the person says oh what was clearly that was very well may use the word the oh well don't you don't want to be at the dog with someone on the right you\nKnow trying to use the word be that's kind of watch\nIt what what what what word ... me [noise]\nOh gee I'm suffering here [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nLet me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nTo comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller i._d. I lost her when she was how families will gas light\nA the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light a I got\nAn ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course is abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point this is a different way of saying that it\nIrritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here\nIndiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to bake a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples would then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor the media was outraged and they began to report on this\nAs though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude know thing that they do\nWear what they report in the way they reported what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors asking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family no we wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana ...\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on\nIndiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ... I Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did\nTo the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is al heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and just supremacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA the synagogue shooting while the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for the maybe the weather report these things to make it look\nLike they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition spit numbers normal are trying to\nTurn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't\nIt used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ... I gotta I gotta you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings months [noise] and\nChris Wallace was always\nPolite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure to tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because he doesn't he would never get a question and after ... the first one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Madison", "day": "30"}
