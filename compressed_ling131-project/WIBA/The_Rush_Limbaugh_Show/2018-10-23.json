call Yes sir\nThis morning I was listening to NPR and Steve [laughter] I ate a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying\nThat it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark the here's what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's you know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation or whatever that means for them and that meant it they can do for\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I registered NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and and that happens while I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\n[laughter] ah but but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and the violence in ...\nAnd it just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day side I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just because they're human beings I guess it's a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing we've got reporters\nBetter than they are now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault me screwing Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm\nA they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\nWay most or ... or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to [noise] you know\nOn the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past them he's not looking at I'm there behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and managing for\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it in so doing everything it can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people as a tell his audience who they all are and why we owe them and why we need to open our borders to them\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats book asked about the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\n\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on immigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote\nDemocrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nThreatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of\nHim because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that they they attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nNow they're worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense it lays with that because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right\nNow this group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta\nPut yourselves in their shoes every day they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times how Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with ... is gonna be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now you have ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked that thing it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nTo be tied\nOver it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about

J. B. T. Jew a transgender software out raged over this [noise] and I both expertly explained why when we get back\nMore consideration to people who come from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and a entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico from Washington and Lee attempting to\nImmigrate across the border\nBuddy it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala El Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starch south of Michael\n[noise] and that's a lot of what's going on here but if you in any way permit\nThis mob but to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and\nSay come on it just can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure\nBorder control a American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like summer started we can't stop at rush we can't stop it we just got a lot of men we can't stop it\n\nI I think it's ... it's almost a variation of a ... hour proven or even Easter sociologist who believe that the way to really transform America the way to really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state just nothing as many people as possible demanding in claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left\nOut and that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's of I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun it illustrates America\nIs by itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to share what it's not fair we have so much they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't\nDoubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America for the purposes of trans

this about what why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population it's not even one percent here\nAnd yet it's become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically meaningless\nAre you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female determined by a person's genitals is old fashioned\nIt has no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by\nSensible scientists so this is the party of science or Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and so forth climate change\n\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeonholed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote Dr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea\nThat a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so\nYou have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from Mount Sinai in New York\nWe know that there are a and there is a significant and durable biological underpinning to gender identity well we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand that in two thousand eighty and it is hard wired it is biological is not entirely hormonal\nAnd we don't have identified pain so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender has [noise] ah in studies of twins if one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here that's also in the business NBC News\nUS President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux in that he aims to protect the country after a report that his administration was considering defining janitor as male or female based on gender tail at birth and that drew wide spread condemnation\n\nTrump says we have a lot of different concepts right now\nA lot of different things happening with respect to transgender rights now asked about a campaign promise to protect the L G B. T. Q. community Trump said I'm protecting everybody\nI Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday the Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth than it would be an changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simple eighth and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\nThis is all politics\n\nPure and simple total politics disguised\nAs something else the Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities and is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks or issues in the Democratic party platform\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nBeing given the whole weight of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it\nBut I finally did and I really do believe that there are many\nPsychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party\nAs political issues that are then used as a as as\nThe joined a list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledged that government to deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition into an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status to things that\nThe area as best as our business of the week denominator business even your own just go to W.

fitting proof of what we have been saying about how the Democratic agenda is driven by people with mental disorders and and uh when I say this I say this with all\nCompassion towards people with mental disorders the Democrat Party is converting those mental disorders and really lying to these people they're converting these mental disorders which need to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they're convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of governments sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get whatever is troubling people face that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe

Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see the Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing\nThey are using the show ... story to try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern votes and of course the journalist vote which they don't have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist boat but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people to Trump is responsible for all of these things an Arab people so upset and so angry and now they're
