Andrew Freedman he's the\nExtreme weather expert we asked them why the storm intensified so quickly as it was before and it was weakening before it hit this one on the other hand Michael intensified right before it hit so we talked to him about why it intensified and why we're seeing more extreme weather events\nIt was an extraordinary intensification rate this is something that\nForecasters have a lot of trouble with\n... with her came Lawrence when Florence went through a period or I or the vacation like computer models caught it had it on with this one we knew the signs were there but it seems to be having a little bit of trouble overcoming two factors why some weight and share which was\nDisrupting the score and score and would block these huge thunderstorm atmosphere only lose the top for them to the strong wind and then the other one was a visit dry air\nThat ... that was disrupting circulation at some point on Tuesday night it\nSuddenly seemed to come free from the grip the boy was holding it back and just when gang busters for several hours really transformed itself into a very ugly storm very beautiful nuclear logically speaking but ugly or whoever it is and and\nJust kept going what we normally see our storms that approach the Florida Panhandle and weaken\nAs they near laugh and that's what it did the opposite it was pale intensify as it cross the beach\nThe news obviously plays up a lot of these weather events have reporters walking and flooded areas and standing in the wind in the rain just to\nIllustrate what's going on so people in other parts of the country know what's going on there is that but there is the scientific consensus that extreme weather is on the rise why are we seeing more of these big weather events\nAs we said with foreign ... it was huge and that was falling out and it was doing all this crazy stuff the same thing with this one it intensified in the last few moments before it made landfall\nWhat is going on with all these extreme weather events\nWe know that we have more extreme weather events that are becoming more intense and more frequent with climate change plain and simple that is particularly cake with heat wave and heavy precipitation events it's not as clear hot with hurricanes with scientists thinker\nIs happening and demonstrate that didn't study is that they are becoming weather really they're producing more rain fall on average and they are either already\nGetting stronger or expected to seem more high end hurt so you might have\nYou were a hurricane season but a bigger percentage of them is going to be ... or ... now that matters a lot because the the couch for ... five storms because most of the ... with both\nFlorence and with the current storm you had both storms go through periods of rapid intensification that mean that it intensified by about thirty five miles an hour or greater in twenty four hours this\nFar exceed it that baseline definition of what we think we made\nAnd I say we meaning the climate community and as somebody who covers the community I Am I'm a way but really it's the scientists who are doing the work and they're saying to me we think we might be seeing a trend towards more frequent rapid and I'm a kitchen that's a real forecast challenge\nBecause of that happening more frequently you could go to sleep thinking you're going to get hit by a gory one and wake up the hit by a category for the real nightmare with this storm\nAndrew Freedman science editor for Axios extreme weather expert thank you for joining us they can ...\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOne of the other huge stories of the week was just this surreal moment in the Trump Administration when rapper Kanye West went to the oval office he had a meeting with the president\nAnd in true ... fashion he just had this stream of consciousness or rent it provided a lot of laughs a lot of question marks nobody knew what he was going for sometimes Miranda you're a big fan of ... yeah so what did you think of it\nI have not yet in ... myself to watch the full video right because I still want to continue being a fan of tiny he's made it very challenging because I don't often agree with President Trump\nHe talked about the hat and how was the Superman Cape for him we actually have a little portion of that let's play ... at the oval office\nUh I think it's the slavery that helps you see this game called life you know they try to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but his hat it gives\nThe power in a way it was something that I put\nAnd they feel like Superman who made\nHot and humid for\nFor me also got unless you look around\nAmerica and this guy no ... no one will be gone at how we want to do a five to ... go ahead and get\nThe president just smiling politely at the end he said hey you know what that was very impressive\nAnd you know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost he feels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia new species a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when Carney was there with the president said we spoke to her about her impressions of that and then she was also part of a bigger story that happened early in the week she had a private press conference with the president\nMike Pence Mike Pompeo chief of staff John Kelly and that also was another surreal moment it was the closest thing you've ever get to being a fly on the wall so when we come back from the break we'll get

rumors and running down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] the most dramatic\nStories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIt's the only link that gets us up to the international space station\nSo for more on this we turn to rot pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com and we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nWas a flight as you said a woman astronaut when USS not one cause not go up the space station there in the Soyuz spacecraft which also writes a quarter rocket I'm the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station gr we're gonna come back though the space station always has the story is capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official\nSeal of approval on that for coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew\nOr not he didn't\nSo apparently what happened is it made it through about two minutes of flight staging per se per second stage or what I can tell if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally I drove the dream but it's been a long time since I've looked at the soldier there might have been something going on the one of the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either\nThe engine built to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another that had to abort\nThe rockets designed to be able to do that and they all have been since the early space or work on\nBeside the the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really the method aboard option until much later than when you aboard your ground control punch was a big red button and a capsule let's go for the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burned for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the abort but it's like getting slammed up the block a car great right because\nThey said they were forced to do a lipstick reentry what exactly does that mean because they said that during that ... that that have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot\nAnd even in a normal ... you're looking at maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so\nBut ballistic ridge remains ... this is what they did the very early space age days back and mercury and\nAbbas stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in ... glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle in a way the field is is either in such a way of the ... and they use guidance rockets to themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways about heat shield 'cause ... gives you four to\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy okay that could have been figured out she called in advance so they said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt\nThey had to call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right\nAnd that in of itself is a huge pain there is a fun fact I think you can share this Miranda a frontier airlines features a variety animals on the tails of its point\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar Semitic or of\nCourse they did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on an emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses third is again miniature horses seem to be quite a pop auto wanting the question then becomes how do people get emotional support\nAnimals I feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better it was actually a protocol that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed you have to actually go to a mental health professional right and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental\nIllness or ... motion on disability you may had and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support him cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo they can be any age can be happy it could be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't going to run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut listen at delta spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administer to them the flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people for those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctor is now is what it\nWas even Web sites where you can go on line fill out a yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to your friend's wedding\n[laughter] that's just ... it's a tough thing because\nRiding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's gonna happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane is already going to be a problem\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda depends\nOn the people that I see at the gate if they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but if there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already opposite and it'll\nCause that anxiety or you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you did get anxious what would your emotional support animal will be and it can be a cat or a dog has got to be a little some something a little more exotic\nOkay cause might go to is I'm going to bring my dog I there are ten years less I Would have\nBrought my own dog as well but you can't do that this was something\nIn the line of a ... and hamsters can I have an emotional support turtle there you go that's a that's a good one they're quiet kind of cute and calm that's true that's my animal turtle\nI think my emotional support animal would be US law because they move again they're quiet they don't get into too much action but I'll take that long I think that would be cute and something fun to a good conversation started Oh thank you Miranda I think that\n[noise] [noise]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend is sure to check out the daily

there and you wrote Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part of the things some Democrats do not think\nThat this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\n... let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it wouldn't worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of their range lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly the ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the middle [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea well\nWe don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh four of them in during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democratic side it's not gonna fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad in saying crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day\nAnd the day after a two thousand sixteen and this ... situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now I mean they're still\nTalking about investigating Kevin offered her pulse he wants to see the F. B.\nI. documents released she wants a full\nFledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house and they're going to impeach cabinet they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this some side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging\nIn what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they were going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nI simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\nYear did it happen I don't know what what neighborhood was that in a I don't know ah where's the house I don't know upstairs downstairs where was it I don't know\nBut I had one beer she remembered of everything about she had one beer old Trump did was tell the nation\nHer answers to the seminal questions\nOf the event she couldn't answer anything and the poor people she said were there all the night at the mainstream media had reported none of that Trump did it and that was the turning point folks do not doubt [noise]\nHello I'm Andy British the British group of UPS we live in an amazing time for the first time ever you can call someone on the other side of the world and talk face to face on your cell phone and computer with a click\nIt doesn't cost a dime our relationships are global business is global and the opportunities that they are truly global why then do most financial service companies knew almost all their business at home at the British group we offer the international perspective and opportunities presented by UPS\nFrom the excitement of emerging markets to the volatility of Europe did the explosive growth in Asia and beyond our team of professionals can help you explore international financial opportunities while helping you manage those risks\nIt's only ... feet underground in a truly global perspective that we can help bring a world of options to a discerning of flu and quiet\nInterested in learning more called the British group to see how we can help you achieve your financial goals find the British group on line or give us a call at six to eight eight three one four to eight to ... financial saying it says number ... if I pity\nFor more information about this they go to W.

I. D. A. and here if you follow my work you know one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now and how the woman goes into a clinic comes out of data there's no police report and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions directly from governor regions office not perfect of course\nThe producers of the guys numbers he came to me for help I jumped at the chance I personally donated to make sure this film ... main mainly Cormac God's Neal is perhaps the most holistic serial killer merits dean Cain empire cast it was the perfect job bringing the powerful story about good versus evil too big\nFour children and you don't have to be a pro life activists you be worried movie Carrie it's not the mother is too I promise you you can and should bring your teenage children bring friends and family you do not want to pass a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about\nAbortion ... rated PG Thirteen no play\nWhen did that just that mom I wasn't going to get better and\nI'm never going and I'm not reading\nGreece will how\nKind capable of caregivers who know how to handle the tough moments\nI'm telling you didn't care when you don't know where to turn\nOf phrase so help\nIt is a digital people's day to day Trump praising Columbus spirited determination at adventure provided inspiration to generations of Americans [noise]\nYou couldn't even say that Columbus opened up their owners and diversity to America [noise]\nIncluding horses simplest\nUm personal injury attorney Steve Cairo if an insurance company executive gets injured in a car accident would they denied their own claim my client the young lady had a serious lower back injuries after her automobile accident the insurance company denied her claim insisting the injury was priests\nThis thing at trial facing potentially worst damages from a jury the insurer capitulate it suddenly for seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars from get lost to three quarters of a million is the difference between great representation and subtle mills somewhat mill law firms accept insurance company denials and low ball Solomon's because their business model has no permission to fight\nGeneric ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in the CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to plus Thirteen that I I just I maybe it's my desire\nMaybe it's my home but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus on the west the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe that after the last\nTwo to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of auto elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was an election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially high and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answered a what ails America\nNow the dry and buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen\nMargin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface was seemed to have public opinion on their side and\nSays the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved of further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved other\n\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by a narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving everybody did it you know being ... [noise]\nI Can't prove anything all I have to go on\nA experience\nGuided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct\nI'd just like everybody believes this blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story the drudge for example links links to on his page is a story of the Democrats with\nA massive landslide retaking the house of representatives\nAnd there are stories where Republicans supposedly I think the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual polls show nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the in the English I'm I'm just talking about over all national\nAttitude um\nAnd I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issue that everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is out a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentlemen that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the\nDemocratic Party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not dumped me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that\nEvery Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous as they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever\nCertainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aid coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously\nI guarantee you they were looking at those crowds there ...\nBut those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalties that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made a speech\nExcept for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering how long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this then I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it\nDoesn't work maybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able to show\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in\nTerms of survival um and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how exist Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of Akaka media and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points\nBack the Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the melt down\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nAnd very quickly\nWhen the family of a young Marine Corps veteran lost their father because of the negligence of the Veterans Administration that family knew they needed smart experienced attorneys who would take on the federal government [noise] and when they chose Clifford in rye hauled him\nNot only did quit for it and try to fight for that family\nAnd helps him obtain justice for their fathers wrongful death we also made sure the VA changed their operations to protect others from that same harm\nI'm John Ryan how law if someone's negligence has interview or a loved one you need experience lawyers who will stand by you can make things right\nCall us we'll fight to help you received your maximum recovery\nRelentless dedication to helping you and your family she's ... hard working skilled attorneys fighting for you for jackass my geckos dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to Russia's week in review\nHey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back as always in the interests\nAnd equality [noise]\nSorry last caller Sean from\nPhiladelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from political [noise] just just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred and Eighteen needed\nTo win control this is what you were just telling me right and\nIt you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true some I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe that's OK so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats unique in for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so two hundred nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this\nIf the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington and live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave\nI don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTo thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right\nWell as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of discussed other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nGetting harder and harder to\nWatch television shows what was I watching you know you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're asking will be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage\nAnd they asked me you cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two sides that are born or I don't see them and the cops\nWe bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the civil that's it\nFor the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informative smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with asthma so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nDuring Republican president Xi's nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's\nHouse and she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow\nSally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just better than everybody they got a nice way this guy had more allegations I'm literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was let me\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ... by reputation\nCo go get a picture that guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here and show you on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Tower\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo and drivers right well anyway she asserts that happened in a cab that John Powell\nTried to sexually assault do in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of man and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding on the Senate or a stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car and\nSays screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think that in power and got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot and God but I went in the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um but but you know

citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and pled ... their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries but Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here to Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on I'm On poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nKeep you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal the steak every liberal I\nYeah and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only\nWay\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws that are ... today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been\nCapable of winning legislation to\nImplement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional\n... he is not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well\nCertainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christian I'm a poor listening to one another working at our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the rights of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage earned by applauded they supported that is who they are\nMy comment was on the media reaction the Taylor says well here's Taylor Swift it comes out so she can't stand that woman running for the Senate and Tennessee just can't stand her\nThe median desperate\nThen reports that Taylor Swift comments caused massive Democrat voter registration\nJust just making it up\nThen the president announces he's going to have lunch with Kanye West than the oval office tomorrow what happens next Mr Jay Z and Mrs Jay Z Beyonce come out and denounce cognac\nEnd and Kim ... to ... they denounce ... and his wife Kamkar dashing meanwhile Taylor Swift host some music award show last night nobody watched it the ratings plummeted doing all time low\nSo how can it be the Taylor Swift sponsored\nInspired massive voter registration drive after criticizing Democrat or Republican Senate candidate in Tennessee\nNow where is this massive belief and supportive he's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express their support in why didn't the same people turn on and watch her show\nBut we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia camp extrapolate to voter registration drives an audience was for award show I cam you people can make it up left and right I can draw a mild analogies I can ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but the this stuff doesn't um intimidate\nYou I think I think it has an intimidated every Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have you or how you doing\nWell thank you longtime listener measures her first time caller thank you\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing with I listen to the last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in love that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm being uncivil to the likes of her\nShort would sure whether it be that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is justice\nThat is what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFinding backer resisting it we deserve what we can\nArgue Alexis Honda or Toyota hybrid owner ask your current service center the following question then see what the answer is just my I have a battery built
