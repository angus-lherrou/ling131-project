all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist mobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember we had a\nCall here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump the yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well that camp that camp that does it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death of these maniacs and that's\nWhy yard signs of not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches of Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way so\nI have a video taken by Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it took a still shot that what a puppet pop up here just second this\nPicture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy\nDemonic looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then are ripping it to shreds\nAnd at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera and got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStart shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken a still shut up put it up there this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping 'em up out of yards and this still shot here storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he acts\nFor this country being me racist massage and this take place than it is\nA bomb a campaign strategic we decided to become the party of every minority group that exist in the end it could be manufactured\nThey combine all these minority groups and that would become a gigantic\nDemocrats constituency\nSo big so large that it would dwarf anything the Republicans could put up even if they got all of the white working class will we know how it turned out Obama continued to preside over Democrats losing elections all over this country\nWell Mr Thomas Bee and saw what is Mac [noise]\nAnd this piece was in the New York times and the headline the Democrats left turn is not an illusion this result we didn't think it was\nA there is nothing [laughter] there's nothing about the stark raving mad\nAspects of today's Democratic Party that is an illusion is all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why when the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not that illusion so they want you to know\nThey want readers to notice left turn is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub bad like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties and the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years and years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and soul the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and for ... odd [noise]\nI'm On the Democrat Party elite sad to say we're never these radical leftists now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph was just the money crafts\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party does say simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup their share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrats minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not been growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute\nIn two thousand eleven the white working class was told to go to hell now all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high\nFor Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rage that they have been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\nWasting a much stronger emphasis then African Americans now wait because earlier this week we have a story but the Republican Party Owens white suburban women\nRight we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrats liberalism\nWho are back back in ...\nShrimp boat show you know I'd be miss work how\nCan I didn't mean\nWhy do ruled brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroyed by our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight [noise]\nKevin McCarthy bull headed for so long\nFully funds President Trump's border\nExpands caseload ... living\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves\nThe leadership of President Trump\nSo health President Trump\nFor the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law\nFor by the Tea Party express [noise]\nWhen the family of a young Marine Corps veteran lost their father because of the negligence of the Veterans Administration\nThat family knew they needed smart experienced attorneys who would take on the federal government [noise] and when they chose Clifford ... not only did quit for then dry ... fight for that family\nAnd helps him obtain justice for their fathers wrongful death [noise] we also made sure to be a change their operations to protect others from that same harm\nI'm John rye hubbub if someone's negligence has injured you or a loved one you need experience lawyers who will stand by you to make

and we've got this guy tester\nIn Montana and they're all trying to\nUs that they're not wild liberal left us there ... all this except we find out that's not really true or not\nHere comes Thomas Bee saw saying don't believe them this move to the ... after the Democratic party is real and it's solid so Thomas Bee and Saul is giving\nHis own Democrats have been a problem he's calling them out [noise]\nBeginning yearly physical to keep yourself healthy you get dental checkups to prevent cavities\nThere's no place for that kind of language you shouldn't have said that since Speaker Paul Ryan who is usually measured in his criticism of the president\nRepublican history teacher is Liz mayors have yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern when\nYou're constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise] [noise] right on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal today written Mr certainly this is the name of land tomorrow ring a bell to you\n[noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in the ... he was the premier journal is not was not an executive buddy practically ran the place I\nMet him at Mr Buckley is home here in ... ... you were good buds but Lance Morrow\nWas a a\nTypical federalist which means means left and so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump you always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should gives people just got used to it\n\nEnded up the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a rubber band for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican or maybe the headline is true the Republican fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a\nSuburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\n\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nIt I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll lose maybe holy elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they assume this is it dad zipped Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may go does not take action to stop the also this is the caravan\nThat's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democrat Party land because they want to open borders and existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party led a salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals\nEntering from Mexico to the U.S [noise] these people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who are really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand ill legal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying\nFor this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking thing that they've\nGot to be using facilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power to vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say of the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on a track there's got to be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere\nSomebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incident of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start and by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if they if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump work there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nShould they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border up letting head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in\nAnd this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThat afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do it and just the second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kim was always told me to call you or I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up in South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been all reform report to recently yeah the new diseases out called not a new disease is a disease out that's has an outfit called a F.
