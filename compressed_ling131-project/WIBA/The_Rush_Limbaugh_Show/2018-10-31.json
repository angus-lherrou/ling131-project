the United states of America the way it was founded in the snow complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nVery hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that and how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak or did they will be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at\nThe latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time that they\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him of some kind\nOr tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say in the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically until many of these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\n\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it is going to release it to the most opportune time\n\nDespite the fact there isn't any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller\nAnd his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure that Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\n\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides are participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with Mahler after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities in vi is\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the old for is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what his name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to to the Oprah\n\nYou think she was helpful why but I Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing an Obama would not have won\nOkay Obama what is still won despite what the offer was hounded Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out\nThere she's trying to gin up anti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada if Republicans hold\nThe house ... anybody cares about that other than the people say go get move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't have or move to Canada we got to vote Denver how many people think\nThat that's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nIt's a big deal that Barbara Streisand who nobody cares about might move the cannon\nDon Lemon is not alone here he just happened to be the guy that set it\nBut that happens to be the driving impetus\nBehind much of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men at the problem white Christian men are the problem in virtually every instance so that dates back to the founding of Africa and this is the organizing\nEnergy force behind much of radical liberalism today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy uh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now Rick have bank and they get unfair benefits and so forth and so on and so this\nThis is the culture war that we are in and this\nIs the side opposes a\nThat's why this stuff is all crucial\nI'm personal injury attorney Steve ... people ask what I have against insurance companies other than pending cases the answer is not much\nThey serve a valuable purpose like when one of my clients was on an elevated balcony that collapsed\nAfter two years of litigation the unsure agreed to pay my clients are policy limit at one point five million dollars for another client who had a rotator cuff injury after being struck from behind by an uninsured motorists my clients uninsured motorists coverage vigorously defend it against their loyal customer\nMy clients claim after a protracted fight our jury awarded seven hundred and sixty six thousand dollars almost six hundred thousand dollars more than the insurance companies final offer\nMost personal injury firms are subtle mills clearing cases fast to pay their act or an athlete spokespeople I'm attorney Steve Kyle I'm Glad to come to you and I'll Fight to make sure you are justly compensated regardless of insurance company claim denials insolvent offers insurers to injured redistribution Steve ... an injury lawyer W. I. dot com\nThat's injury lawyer W. I. dot com\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bed we sleep in to the raise that we use when we wake up\nBut we've neglected one of the more important products and the daily routine that old worn out toothbrush I'm Simon ... and I'm a product designer after I learned how important brushing your teeth is overall health I worked with dentist to ... that sort of toothbrush that makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable quip sensitive stomach vibrations that a gentle on your gums and built in time and that\nShow coming up next to Sean how did he get to that you can ask three on news talk through the can tell you why BA and tell me why da da da da\nDe ... taken a couple of days for this to reach the main street [noise]\nNon Lenin ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo all\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week and can jockey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the left is concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration in a real objective has been to transform America away from\nThe traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary and evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in ah in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood into a she\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at right man or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\n\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people even notice how quickly they want to\nDo that notice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority of media you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said let's or Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreating they're racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was just intending to wound to people states ... almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\n\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans know many of them are very loyal\n[noise] we\nAre going to start on the phones are Yuma, Arizona Chris it's great to have your welcome to the ...\nRush thank you so much time listening from the days of David Dinkins argue\nOr a general General David Dinkins where there are fifty four where are you parity yes in me that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline went down\nTwo days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went\nThat [noise] yeah where did it go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there but\nA hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump ... good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that\nCrash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when they decided that time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember CNN go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there and ah this was that was pre Trump\nAnd the the the belief in media is the airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where the damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even asked the former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... certainly remember that Americans are protesting\nAgainst ... but they they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make everything you're doing success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo\nGoogle CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what you want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw it on line\nMenus maybe where Monday morning Monday morning was the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show him that many people especially it was a brand new planet or\nWhether you such a brand new playing what kind of plant was he was bullied will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the time you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news as to what brand new plan going beyond his unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea salt in it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgraded the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down but it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case\nUh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... ...\n... no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nThose who can do for you the best school do on the E.

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweet\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIs it why is it why isn't it a problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is\nThe design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great\nPiece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations Wade Boggs he forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that capital is spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets to convert gets ... get the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B.

years and I finally had to\nLeave because the regime was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class called courses because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi is American history [noise] the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in a way to Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nIs specially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when that\nNow once the ship doctor perform has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because to ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back they ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quick not work\nWhich is not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work\nUm there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets with tape with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paved streets\nBut we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people we want it only strong me healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful and we were on the

presentation they introduce new ...\nYou're pretty cool what are you what do you think you'll never guess ... if I told you every new product that they announced you still would not guess what\nGot

that room erupted into a game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect of movies gives most the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes\nNow let's go to the audio sound like this this folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by hundreds of protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper the protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Columbus hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come

laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program it this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants to download property where she everybody hates Trump everybody's spices Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody\nCan't wait\nTo vote for Democrats so the Trump can't do anything and everybody wants to Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that's your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see those videos you will not hear that audio anywhere\nOn that and reduce the number one talk with your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh muggy like\nGoing you why [noise]\nWhy your old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration

read\nJust hit play and have a howling in time following radio and I already out check it out now\nOn news talk through team can tell you why da and W. I. B. A. dot com [noise]\nCNN was the first to do it a month ago\nCNN declared the Democrats have won the house because one of their polls Nancy Pelosi is declaring victory in the battle of the house she was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night\nAnd set up until today I wouldn't have said in the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now as we will when we when we were when the house\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what's conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in\nTwo thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody for casting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty some of them he predicted was off by two but\nNobody predicted the Republicans are gonna pick ups sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody\nHated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAt what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey ended up being surprised the brightest minds in grave this go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down\nThe\nWhole analyst and data analysts there is Sean ... day I'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out to four pages but the headline here on certain days in the womb has mint terms and her final\nStretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half that's a much polls he had results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democratic majority\nBut this is hair splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober mind that the elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats in the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know those are my words\nNot in this trend days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym British of numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and I swam Republican but wait here's our these is predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on the street print day here\nIs we don't know he's given his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talents that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec uh in New York's\nTwenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality of penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest but what about the\nNineteen representative John Faso is up by a point that the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things and then the next burgers how many votes are ... ...\nCrafts wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been in the massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines\nOr California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't they [laughter] and then the next paragraph are we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next ... what\nIs it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is\nStill it's over we're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise]\nSo the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so what's going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've uh we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob Woodall in Georgia seventh them [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens we're\nWell set up for such an adventure out on the bottom line I happen to live with that idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize is one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up where there's much intelligence analysis you

Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are\nSuccinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and it'd be a way be unbiased if if that's true if a number of these things are true then there could very well be a major surprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this in the bag
