G. Edwards made it very clear in the spring that one of the reasons he came back on and did not go into the NFL Draft was because he believed that he could help take his program somewhere where it had never been in when he was asked about it he said national championship now\nOr if you really step back and evaluated the schedule was going to be much more challenging this year had to replace seven starters defensively and one thing we couldn't anticipate where the struggles that we've seen in the past\nAnd came in and certainly that that came through very clearly against Michigan so when you add it all up that's why Wisconsin right now is for two and into the players deserve credit at least right now because they're not looking big picture they're trying to a week to week and and Michael data to starting\nA left guard said we just need to go to and if they do that they should give themselves a great opportunity to win the west and have a chance\nTo win a Big Ten championship and get to a really good bowl game and at this point that that is as good as they can do\n... ... should get a little bit better today against in Illinois team that's given up thirty one point five hundred yards and two hundred rushing yards per game my goodness well let's get to recruiting now ... and two young men we haven't spoken about yet that have committed for twenty nine teen one is tied in Haiti Grucci\nOut of Pennsylvania and you know ... Christ already has a pretty good young tight end and Jake burgers and added another couple of weeks ago tell us about hating Rudy\nHayden is really putting together a fantastic senior season he's out in Pennsylvania and he was an earlier commit and it's two thousand Nineteen class he committed back on February fit and he's one of the better titans in the country now\nTwenty four seven list them as the number Twenty one tight end in the country but uh I Would argue that he's better than that and and what he's done is improved tremendously as a past catcher and an eight games this season\nHe's got twenty catches for five hundred yards and five touchdown so he's averaging over twenty five yards perception but the thing about Hayden that I think Wisconsin fans are going to love\nIs he will be the first to point out that when he loves most are pancakes and when he when he means by that is the pancake block oh he loves to flat and somebody I'm so he will stick his nose in there and block and he is a great past catcher and so I think we've got we've got another good one at the end\nAnd he's also been one of those leaders in the class who has been out in front trying to convince other people to join and that's what you need to build a really strong class but energy at six five to twenty five a is one of the stronger prospects in that group\nYeah and there's no doubt that Wisconsin sophomore running back Jonathan Taylor is one of the lead candidates for the Heisman Trophy to series second in the league and rushing head over a hundred yards against a Michigan last week and that's the best defense in the Big Ten statistically\nBut there is a young man and in state came from a nominee falls Julius Davis will be joining the batteries in twenty Nineteen I'm sure he'd love to see some playing time although he was banged up early this year when he\nHe was I had a chance to talk to his dad a few weeks ago and so Julius play the first two games of the year and was incredible had five hundred thirty seven yards rushing which led the state and fix touched down and then he suffered an injury\nAnd when I was talking to his dad or they went and saw Dr they've gotten MRI and initially it was believed that he had sports hernia injury but after getting a second opinion\nOr they learn that it was likely a groin strain so that wouldn't require surgery at least that's where things stood a couple of weeks ago uh and so far that's what Julius has been dealing with and you hate to see that for anybody\nA in a senior season because obviously you only get one senior season but Julius special it's not often that Wisconsin offers a scholarship to an end it running back because Wisconsin kind of being running back you can go out and get\nPeople from all over the country last year as a junior Julius really came on the rush for Seventeen hundred and sixty two yards and he had Seventeen touchdown\nAnd buffalo was the first him to take notice and then Wisconsin came in and I think that was kind of a dream come true for Julius but would also makes especially the attention he's received particularly in the ... and it wasn't just Wisconsin after he committed he got scholarship Irish from LSU\nUSC and Notre Dame and when I was talking to his dad about how seriously\nThey considered that um initially his dad said that Julius wanted to visit those schools because it's always nice to feel like you're wanted yeah you have the opportunity to go see that well but ultimately that that is love for Wisconsin and the coaching staff was kind of where his heart was in in his dad's old him you know you\nYou've been doing a lot of recruiting in this call twenty Nineteen class then you're looked at it as a hometown kid and you don't want anybody to a\nI have some backlash on you because you're suddenly taking business elsewhere and maybe that is showing that your commitment is ... really didn't take those were the eastern committed it was not and then certainly the badgers have another good one at running back and you're\nLooking forward to watching him play Jesse thanks for your time have fun watching the game today\nThanks branch Jesse ... be

certainly in the big\nTent yeah you know I've said this before and I'll say it again twenty five point dusted fit in possess the ball but [noise]\nI don't think that's the separation between the two teams to be honest with you um I Would have liked to see in a healthy ... because I thought that the defense despite the fact that end up Loudermilk\nQuite the fact that they started guy you know including ... and what not played all season [noise] did a commendable job for you know more than half that game and then eventually broke down because you often\nDidn't possess the ball [noise] um you can't beat Michigan in Ann Arbor run in forty nine plays and holding it for basically twenty six you how much\nIs Michigan's defense the responsibility there the reason why Wisconsin struggled and how much is Wisconsin just struggling\n[noise] you know there's no doubt Michigan does that\nLook at the history of John Brown's defense since he got so in Arbor Day basically been [noise] top five in terms of shutting people don't throwing the ball and everyone talks about the ... defense but if you look Wisconsin ran the ball of affect me out when it gets what they do against quarterback then [noise]\nQuarter Brooke did not play well the receivers missed an opportunity to make plays whether it's ... committing apparently will fall start dropping a ball that they should've caught there were a couple of key third down blown protection that just should not happen\nYou know ... in a game like that or if they do happen it's going to kill you so there were a number of\nFactors that contributed to it and if they would have just gotten a little bit of the past me and my might have taken some of the stress off but he fell\nOver all when the season began or before it began there was a a fair amount and and I think rightfully so of hype about Wisconsin's off into mind if we're going to be fair about this I I let you answer this question rather than me just make the statement but this line is more suited to run blocking than they are to pass blocking is that fair\nNo I mean there is a solid past like if you look at the numbers that the solid pass blocking line\nIt if you look at the facts that are the pressure that horn and work was under ... they were there were breakdowns it wasn't [noise] chased wonder if it's coming off the edge and blowing up his man they weren't out man two thousand sixteen when they went there that was the issue\nAnd let me say this national writers wrote that this was going to be the greatest off into London history has got some program I saw some guys wrote this was going to be the best team Paul Chris had that was a crack\nAnd I'm not I'm not saying there is no talent here but this line is is a good line but it's not as good as the lines in ten and eleven\nAnd anyone who wrote that this was it would be ... best team didn't watch the defense in the spring and intense [noise] how do they\nPress forward from here what's the what's I mean there's a different ... outside of the program then there is but inside what's the Montrose they march forward after with Illinois here today\nWell you just have to win games you have to for example you got to put this one in the in the victory column today which I expect they will because Illinois got issues okay got some individual talent and keep places but was Scott's comes out in his sharp and has been if the players are ready and not suffering a hangover from last week they are going to be fine [noise]\nBut it's got a very significant game it's kind of brought me for first place in the division at Northwestern which is to me going to be an intriguing matchup you just have to win games in your division\nI was just talking to Brian Barnhart the voice of the line I Am talking about the adoration that was last week I don't know that was or wasn't they got ... at home on homecoming against Purdue where do you see this Illinois program today [noise]\nYou know again there's some they got some talented players in certain spots\nUh they've got some use that they make mistakes they don't throw the ball exceptionally well postcards and defense defends that zone read and stops Bush the quarterback and he's got a couple of my job actually back there I don't see ... marching the ball down the field\nThat gives up a lot on the ground but that is that the box with a ... blocks and Jonathan too it was gonna have a big day I mean\nThe average I think it was twelve for Seventy one last year at a minority they took him out the kind of took the gas pedal [noise]\nI think they're going to affect the Michael Dieter involved in the office\nToday I don't see Michael you ran running an end around we asked him about that I I don't think that's going to happen by the\nWay I Would give you I I doubt that you've ever used the term hammers Boston one of your stories but you up I mean now that you've heard that you can use it if you'd like [noise]\nI tried to use writing that readers will understand as well is it pretty did hammer did watch no that would be no I'm All right and then finally what is what do you hope that what\nShould we see here today what what do you expect to see\nIf Wisconsin you know they set all week the pay more over the last to Michigan we're going to be fine we're going to be focused if that is indeed the case in your poll Christ that you don't truly notes to get on the field\nThey play searched sharp mentally focused they are clearly the better team in Illinois [noise] they'll be fine unless there's some breakdowns defensively maybe
