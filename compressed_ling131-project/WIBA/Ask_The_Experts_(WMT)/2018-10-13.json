I think it's because like we said in the first segment we challenge the status quo we do things very differently\nAnd one of the biggest things we take care of up front is income plain folks that are with us know that all the money they need to to live the kind of life they want as not dependent on the market money that they have in the market oftentimes will be\nPlay money or additional money you know and inflation hedge money yeah so they're not worried they know they're taking care of and and it's not affecting their sleep\nSo a different approach gets a very different result right and and I would just add on to what you said is is that it's really about that overall planning right\nWe have people in the market and you know we've talked and I want to during the segment talk a little bit about some of the strategies we use in the market or thinking for the strategies that we use in the market\nBut it really is about that overall planning to not just about what's the money doing in the market if you've got a ... a an income plan put together and you know where your income is coming from that resolves a whole lot of problems right\nPlus we're managing risk in the market and so guess what when you manage you've got three options you can ignore it you can manage it or you can ensure it\nUse some insurance we use some imaging and we definitely do our best never to it in All right let's correct so but it's about the planning process now we've mentioned a couple of things and by the way the market you know folks\nAs we talk about this for years we have talked about the fact that when you get to retirement\nYou kind of turn your your portfolio on its head what got you to retirement is risk thinking right we took a lot of risk Oregon returns\nBut yeah we're we're in mutual funds that that definitely have more opportunities for returns more opportunities for losses right and that's and then we got there and we'll money away\nAnd so when you are younger and you're putting money away what you do is you focus on those returns and those returns typically come through risk but when we're in retirement you know it's now about how do we hang onto that money and yes we want grow but its principal protection first it's income\nDistribution then comes grill and so what happens is instead of us looking at it from top to bottom risk to safety we now look at it from safety perspective then to risk\nSo when you change that mindset it turns the paradigm on its head it turns your vision the perspective where you're looking at it\nIt changes it makes a very different so we're managing risk we're taking precautions we are creating income plans were finishing out the rest like you know legacy planning and taxes and long term care and they all working together Pete right they're all coordinated they have to be coordinated if they're not coordinated\nAnd you you don't have a complete plans so when we talk about challenging the status quo you know the stock market is had a really rough week right back around the world people don't probably realize this but like you go to train them their stock markets are already in a better market there already down twenty five percent\nHere in the United states were still up for the year even with this rough week that we had it still up for the year when do you make you change when do you take the chips off the table and make them yours you don't have to walk away and leave but when do you change that strategy\nMGD customers could say in should see a five percent decrease in their heating bills Holleman blacker is considered a total loss after a fire friday night it was in the fifty eight hundred block of views in a row damage has been paying that about one point five million dollars\nLast night in sports like good night for the Milwaukee Brewers speeding the LA Dodgers six five in game one of the national league championship series game to today coverage will be three oh nine that's the first pitch over on the Big Ten Seventy it's a badge game day gets underway to thirty Wisconsin playing in Michigan today to kick at six thirty\nYear old who start Thirteen ten WNBA badger volleyball up at north western last night three sets that odd badger hockey uh winter as well the twenty seven it whether central forecasters thanks then it's more of the empowered financial radio show from the WNBA new center I Am ...\nMany area businesses deserve recognition for the major contributions name making the Madison area we've teamed up with genesis painting to salute\nTo area as best as our business of the week denominator business even your own just go to W.

I I Know a lot of our listeners right now are probably scratching their head thinking oh in the world does that work and why haven't I heard about that before well\nI'll tell you why because Wall Street wants to invest it all the time\nThat's why they focus on the innings and it is to Wall Street and advisors advantage to focus on the evening rather than the game itself because they can win an Emmy they can get you focused\nOn the here and now rather than what is really truly your long term gains now let me also just qualified as\nWe don't put everything in the market for obvious reasons we could be wrong\nThat money still can live with those strategies can still lose money they have lost money they have lost money and they don't want to have wrong timing and they'll do it at the wrong time so you still want money especially for income that's not attached right not attached to the market\nBut that said we're managing risk within the market\nTo be is it is it true that one way they manage risk is sometimes when they see some trouble in the market they go to cash they just cash out and just kind of sit on the sidelines [noise]\nYes so we got to be really careful when we talk about this right because this can you know market timing doesn't work and that's what we're told over and over or what the truth is for you and me market timing doesn't work right we get fearful we get scared we see something coming we run the cash\nAnd when I say cash 'em really referring to anything that gets you out of the way of trouble that could be a money market that could be short term bombs that could be all sorts of places so when we talk about cash we're really talking about moving out of the way of trouble but\nIs that three percent three percent\nRight now folks are listed in the mean you have a three percent chance your house could burn down those are the statistics have home owners insurance costs ... of course I mean number one if you got a mortgage it's it's mandatory right but you why do you have insurance on your house\nHave you're not seeing all the flooding recently yeah I mean ... you know ... years yeah I mean okay you've got to protect it All right\nSo now let's go to if you're driving down the road in your car gets totaled what are the percent what's the chance\nThat you are in a car accident and your car gets told\n... it's gotta be\nIt's got it's got to be kind of low it I don't think it happens too often I'm almost Eighteen percent\nThere Saddam could you tell he knows the numbers right Eighteen percent that the reality when you are talking about getting a car totaled there is an Eighteen percent chance that you get a car accident in your cars told now\nYou have how homeowner's insurance\nI Do have homeowners and enter you have automobile insurance of automobile insurance they even have an umbrella policy in case I Need extra charges now you're trying to like if it is Sherry\nSo now let me challenge it with one last thing when it comes to retirement what's your biggest asset most people would say it's their retirement accounts right have you ensure drink come\nYou know what the chances are of or if it wasn't even step back for a moment what about long term care what are the percentages of somebody meaning long term care\nCare going in a nursing home or assisted living or having a home health care person themselves you know what those numbers are what the percentage\nIs believe it's Seventy Seventy two percent Seventy two percent to two percent\nAnd yet I hear people tell me all the time well we're just going to self

Twenty years ago that restricts sex retail shops in New York to industrial areas and this is not so\nHe said as a result of this your lease which you entered into pursuant to a legitimate business license but the business license is to do business it doesn't specify what kind of business or it's very general and now the specificity\nThe local law say if you are in the\nSex the adult entertainment parlor business that is according to the local codes a business that must be specifically asking\nFor a permit and there are rules and regulations that don't exist with other businesses that are not\nOf this ilk a so a company or adults is saying we believe we're not breaking any laws because we have that license and now the entire issue is going to be is a or adults brussel\nConsidered a sex business\nAnd I would argue that\nI Would say just because you have a dolls that are perfectly anatomically correct for the soul use of men pleasure being themselves why would you ever consider that a sex business\nI Would argue it say physiological necessity for men to have sex with silicon dolls\nI'm not being hired by anybody to make that argument I just want to point that out All right let's go ahead and take some phone calls a Gary you've been at it for awhile thanks for holding what can I Do for you\nCan only do we just finished doing our own replicable living trust and I need to transfer it my mortgage for you the truth and I quit cling\nTo ensure sure that's what you want to do is use a quick claim date very simple yeah just to say you can just do it yourself you just transfer who owns a property now my wife and I All right so you transfer it from ... to the trust and that's it and then the trust owns it and the name of the property\nIs now a the name of the trust\nAnd that's the that's the easiest thing in the world I he waited in our ten minutes for that okay it's like I used to work for a station many years ago that the Dodgers were on and\nIt was and they had a sports talk thing because the way it works with professional games or or any kind of sports event on radio stations and television stations or for the most part less so is that the actual game is broadcast and then there's the pre game and post game shows\nThat they do so if you're on for example we have the Dodgers hear it on this station\nAnd a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio and I was doing some recording\nAnd I was listening for a a few minutes or to the game\nAnd I walk past and I looked at the screeners the screen which uh that's how phone calls a come in\nA post command screener in this case Sam picks it up\nAsked some questions give you some rules that no one ever pays attention to get to the point I don't go on and on and on ... bill hang up on you of course everybody ignores that so I get to yell at you and then the call was transferred to my computer I have the same screen and then I decide which ones I Want to take\nAnd I go through it and depending on what I'm interested in what I think is interesting then uh I take the phone call up so at that was a long story to describe what happened next\nI Am a watching the screen and I notice that I'll never forget this guy named man well and I'm looking at the heap it on for an hour and forty five minutes waiting to go on the air\nAnd finally man well is a put on the air uh okay mine well ah what what do you want to talk about what's your question about the Dodgers all he said was yours and he hung up\n\nI Love talk radio\nI oh there's someone who has a life right O O K\nUh [laughter] All right Shawn a note or might go to U.

their false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck alright I'll tell you what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and it two years in Italy they sent me a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back\nAnd they said they give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I went and good program on it and they appraise the car and we're out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition [noise]\nAh ... we'll give you the deal and will give you a hundred percent but you got to buy what our cars but in their printed advertising and my email that specially especially that belief that is a way it raises are paired up are you up to a hundred and ... percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in there but by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I wouldn't had it appraised by car ... and then I came to them and they were the original ... deals to show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the ... the appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nOr came higher than ... oh my God okay so\nSo so they ... they print it out to me and brought it out to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and like I I don't know nothing about that three brought the manager out I gave him the document and email and he goes\nOK well we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean you're a car but show ... condition it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time and he goes it will give you the deal like what you need about what our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'll go but it says you'll buy micro no matter what buyers are not ...\nWell ... and they they just stumbled on themselves\nAnd get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is\nA why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're watching the lying scum\nOkay I I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a dealership from them and that and my truck I drive thirty five of 'em out here in my car sits in the garage so I'm sitting here going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I Would just try and get out of the week\nOh okay uh and they offered a ... they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they are releasing a two year yet yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and that here's here's\nWhere I figured out the dad 'cause it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right okay all I have a a you can sell the car I to anybody else adds that whenever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent okay\nWell the problem was that was the hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which is comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nThey would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right oh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem with the damages are and how you figure out\nA God because I uh the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't didn't you turned it in and you took the deal are saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it just small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and uh the formula I didn't understand a word it\nSo ah that works out now isn't it\nThe ... when it comes to math\nBeyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr\nA hundred and why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works\nJamie Hi Tammy yes good morning do yes ma'am my\nQuestion is I Am one of the war on earth ... on a property and I have them pay the property taxes for several years\nI have a record can I put marine\nThat property you already on the property you're one of four owners know when you get what you can do is sue the other ones for their pro radish share\nI mean for the new the new and what we bought the debt so it just starts all over the fact that what they called me I don't\nKnow if I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... collection is\nOkay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report\nYes absolutely entitled on and it's still on the credit report correct\nOkay you can't forget about the collection agencies are they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or or as I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports that's that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively having no credit especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years I've been dropping from the credit report and what are they going to say nope that policy has gone\nOn it's crazy I agree it's crazy\nYeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients who had ah the issue of whether these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example non paper to Crump a credit card or any written a contract\nAnd a credit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real ...\nAgencies have called and people know there is a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years ago there's a forty year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they changed the law last month it's now a ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my clients that okay just sent me this give me the code just tell me what ... told me the number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh\nYou know that sort of thing that is horrible world out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole is I think it's gonna be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit\nBut it's ah it it has to explode just has to explode\nAll right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello by the year and a half ago my Seventeen year old and a

news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the AIDS or that yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there's I mean theoretically there you go to the doctor that you get stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an ... an emotional issue when you get scratched\n[laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is their right mind means or anything they're in you know everybody ... this is America where you'd default to how do I get\nMoney I said how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money\nOh sure that's a great case\nOh why not avenues high Agnes welcome to handle I'm a law saying goodbye sure\nWell I got a pie problem I have a life that I think that's a that's a war that guy come to work less than half hour and they kept me seven hundred I didn't I doubt it I Won that that I have to and then ride at family and\nFrom what I mean how much should you pay seven how do they\nKnow how much do you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nThink that the that hoping less than half hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they're fixing half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you an estimate they already did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed and when did they did they say he was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... the hand or do a bill for eight hundred dollars\nYou know there are no nothing already than just don't pay I go then\nWell then that's the problem you have a Agnes\nBecause you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so on and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's a that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right the work they did\nNot know what do you think you should pay I don't know I think no more than ... about it\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around assume for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they're going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say is too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just ... me off its predatory\nBut I have nothing to do this and that and then\nWhat do you mean you have now did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't look credit card\nOkay so you have to prove that you paid them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying is too much\nAnd you want your money back and they overcharge you okay and you didn't know they overcharge you until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was gonna be eight hundred dollar she agreed they're going to lie about it at this and you're going to go to court and tell us your judge okay that's that's all you can do\nThat I asked him before I go\nTo of course you you have to ask them first okay that's the law you have\nTo make a demand in writing say you over charge me I've checked around\nAnd by the way you do have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I I think it's only we're two hundred dollars 'cause what kind of expertise you have ... nobody cares what you think it's I've checked around and you do want to check\nAnd it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharged me I Want my six hundred dollars back you make

O. W. A. L. S. how you spell just last name the call way dot com or Jeff is president of course of the call investment group the retirement specialists and again we're taking your calls right now so give us\nA call with any question and Jeff you always have topics that\nThey you know just for a couple more things before we we start with that just a little bit more about the call that a group that I'm you know it's it's interesting that we are ... the retirements specialist and everybody on their team\nUh from top to bottom or talk to the same language we all talk retirement planning ... so I think when you come and work with the ... of Asperger we've always put our clients interests first and I think that's refreshing for people come to work with us they know that you know we we don't we always look out for them first\nSpencer reminds me of something I can I mention this year sponsoring the Jay Webber town hall meeting up is ah when I hear those commercials all week long that's very that's going to\nDebate with or not to be the the the town hall with a Nicholson than a billion dollar so that should be that should be pretty interesting and you know it's not done or just the sponsor days are really good guy I'm so there'll be nice to do with him that event with him at the end of the month\nYeah those town hall meetings are quite a [noise]\nThey are very popular with our listeners put it that way it has a medical that she got involved in that should be should be fun All right we're going to take some calls in just a bit but okay let's get started with your stories you sift in your ways ...\nAlong you prep for the show and I'm going to ... and I do all week long I'm looking for things that I think are of interest and they have an impact on you and your retirement planning and that's really our focus here in our focus on our practice and this is a USA Today article\nIt says why IRAs bank for one case among older Americans [noise]\nUm I I thought it was kind of interesting and why would that be and all depends if you're an accumulation phase or in the in the distribution phase let's look at the Adam shell is the author this says for most working Americans the savings vehicle of choice as the four one K. but the flood of\nRetirement savings dollars moving from these employer sponsored plan the IRA suggested retirees or workers nearing the end of their careers\nFavor individual Rick retirement accounts when it's time to tap the cash they've amassed older Americans are driving the trend shifting their savings to take advantage of Iraqis more flexible withdrawal options\nAs well as some other perks I have to\nStop right here in the article and say in many cases probably most cases it makes sense to take money out of four one K. is rolling ... get into the reasons for that\nBut there are some certain circumstances especially underline exclamation point especially if you're retiring between age of fifty five and fifty nine and a half\nBecause they're a special exceptions for that that you have to be aware of where that may make sense for the ... at least some of your money inside of your four one K. anyway let's get back to this\nUm this one times or the time but people entering their golden years it therefore when case um they need to start accessing the money to pay living expenses and generate a steady income stream\nI in five or ten to twenty Seventeen Ninety six percent of the two trillion dollars an Irish contributions came from rural overs that's occurred is really a source associates retirement ... consulting and research for\nResearch firm IRA assets are also rising rapidly because the account balance is being rolled over our sizable\nAs most four one K. accounts represent their careers worth of savings\nYou you talked about that and you know you you use your options that you have and then one of the big reasons that people are moving money on for one k.'s into IRAs as if one to get advice um you know if you work with professional advisor like us at the Columbus group the retirement specialist [noise]\nYou know you get advice or people are looking out for your best interests and if you've done it worked in a lifetime as an engineer is the executive or is\nIt as worker putting money away regularly into your four one K. plants and now ... comes time to retire you haven't focused on this your whole life you focused on your career and your family your whole life and now he come up with a large amount of money see now what do I do\nAnd fallen K plan is almost some I don't want to say out of sight and out of mind because it shouldn't be but some people don't pay close attention to a ...\nAnd if you're cumulative some real wealth and those are nice walk away with a large amount of money and say I don't want to blow this this is my my family's future it's not just me now it's my family's future too\nAnd your outs you may be out of the accumulation phase and now you're into the distribution face is pending face they could fall yeah make sure that you know somebody who's who's used to handling large amounts of money can help you with this is what we do all the time\nMost come a distribution option for it at a four one K. plan for example is a lump sum and that's not always the best choice\n... straws at any time and the amount the account older chooses foreign key participants are worried they won't be able to access or savings whereas IRAs don't have those limitations says ... who's from that or he was really associates\nThe average life four one K. plan offers point nine investment options uh investor who rose over into an IRA a was a at a brokerage account may have hundreds or maybe thousands of options and you're going to use those but\nGo back to that the average for one kid this was an average average veteran twenty nine investment options interesting me IRA offers a lot more\n... retirement report um\nUsually I get some pretty good information from from this people ask me what kind of publications do rain it's lots of big one that slot a is a a a nationally known a author and a a retirement plans has a\nLead IRA advisor program a participant in a very technical ah this kept his retirement port report a lot of times as you I get some pretty good stuff from here\nBut this is getting your portfolio in fighting shape wakeup calls it never pleasant but this one was particularly harsh over the course of just nine trading days in late January in early February of this year us stocks drop temper says investors fret over government report\nShowing higher than expected wage inflation the plunge wiped out stock market gains for the year and talk to the point of swift it's corrections in recent decades and just last week there were saying that the NASDAQ has required has recovered his back to the all time high but the down yesterday ... five hundred have not\nI always get good it's time to get up and whip your ... your portfolio into shape for the challenge is to come\nThat doesn't mean you should abandon your thoughtfully constructed investment mix and yank money out of stocks just because it dropped\nBut retirees with the most plain vanilla portfolio such as those with core holdings that closely tracked the S. and P. five hundred stock index and now as aggregate bonded next maybe in particular need of a portfolio boot camp\nThat says yeah sixty forty a bond thing is as good a five year returns have been good both us stocks looking richly value and rising threatening rising rates threatening bonds\nLipman Gregory Asset Management says that we're very much believe that a retiree are traditionally balanced portfolio should really be diversified\nAway from Korea U.S stock and bond holdings I thought that was pretty interesting and it was in line with our with our thinking ethical investment group we tend to put more money into a technology a little bit more money overseas in in us and for um a stocks and bonds\nOr it says when a place and retirees portfolios of course a fun should provide much more than just diversification for retirees capital preservation is one of the key guiding principles\nA you want to invest and managers who's track record show that they've been able to stare down multiple bear markets there's a lot of E. T. F. which we manage those a strange treated by any chance or if they could pull\nIt off you know any acronyms earn your I've been using\nA ... most people in their retirement near the healthy slug stocks to help their portfolios keep pace with inflation and reduce the risk dull outlived their income but of all your holdings are moving in sync and your stomach is turning you could benefit from broader diversification so I thought that was\nA pretty good article again there was a ... retirement report just saying that if you're in retirement and you have a lot of money into these just index funds you may want to start paying attention to the airport for\nBack to the phones we go next step by the retirement clinic WNBA Madison and W. ice in the Milwaukee this is bill from Elton grove about how I Am\nI I'm\nI'm retired and I need the money out of my retirement accounts for income I'm not Seventy a deal but I've got four fifty seven\nDoesn't make any difference tax wise which one I withdraw money from\nI'm just curious if you did you have an option to put any after tax money into your four fifty seven plan\nA yes see I Do have some after tax money the a a good strategy free might be just to and that for Paul I'm Sorry you were you brought this up you said the schools and ratio if you will all that into the IRA and don't separate the pre tax and post that tech stuff that's where it gets complicated from attack standpoint [noise]\nUh and and everybody's different done and I don't know your all your specifics but you may benefit from what we talked about earlier rolling your four fifty seven plan into a Roth IRA for the after tax money into an IRA\nPre pre tax money and then deciding what kind of income you need from from each all of it or are they all of it yeah from ... from attack standpoint you've asked doesn't matter what you take a different take it from the four fifty seven or from the IRA [noise]\nUh yes if you if you could take after tax money out tax free from the four fifty seven plan but you could also do that from the raw\nAnd it gets a little bit more complicated if you have the um the vendor the um administrator for the for fifty seven plan to try and and help you with the tax planning on that so that maybe were white talked by their owners are working with advisor rolling into that Iran may be\nPerfect for you that makes us has still yeah\nOkay I was just ... just give you an example of the bill as a million dollars is a retirement plan tour of fifty thousand is after tax [noise]\nIf he rolls that all into an IRA then he has exclusion ratio twenty five percent of it comes out tax free Seventy five percent is taxable out of every dollar that comes out of it\nSo you have to maintain exclusion ratio throughout the life then until you get all of your tax free money out it's just a pain better thing to do would be the split into two accounts take your after tax money put that into Ross ticket protect money put that into an IRA\nNice and clean that way we\nHaven't used that term exclusion ratio on the show that much since they started the show back in a a two thousand and one right we've done is you know it's a little complicated tax cans yeah one of the\nThings we do at the Columbus Booker but again everybody and their team from top to bottom we all talk the same language so everybody in our on our team is familiar with those terms and how to get around it and how to make sure that for the benefit of the clients it's done the proper way the\nTax consequences Jeff to your retirement plan or ... you can overlook that part of your planning I Would have with every claims that you sit down with and a half tax\nDiversification as well in other words some of it's going to be a tax will fully taxable a as ordinary income tax some of it's going to be tax free you with municipal bonds or with um [noise]\nI'm a Roth IRAs take money from us IRAs and you know so many I may have a capital gains tax Asia ... different text buckets as well\nAnd as part of the plane than we do for our clients to make sure that you address those different areas which still want to take advantage of where do you take money from when you need money income in retirement\nGetting into a nice little rhythm here we have a topic for me with on a call that a topic then a call now it's time for your next topic let's sneak that in quickly in the meantime we do the sexy thing coming up on the show and also more of your calls coming up so if you want to grab one of the open lines do so quickly and we'll get you on the retirement clinic at seven nine nine eleven\nSeems like every week we're talking about bras and it's not that's not the intent but this was I thought a very well done an article by at slot this he talks about a Congress said no Ross vacation for now uh\nThis is just for a recent article within the last two weeks and this and you don't follow you know what I've said was it ... but with some of the ... the the term is that somebody tells you not to worry about certain things you know there are thinking about doing a\nVery big [laughter] I Would that mean anything at all I Do worry about dialed ever happen just like it's about to happen is you know they're in first place don't worry about them slipping [noise]\nYeah I don't know I live with a ... to go there you know but anyway the\nBut that's with Congress to do with ... with the so called raw suffocation a\nAs a review rasa vacation has become known as a widow raise revenue for the federal government government in effect by taxing four one K. contributions Ross is the case with an eliminate the tax deductions for four one K. and other playing catch bushes and replace them\nWith the Ross four one K. plant types where you wouldn't get deduction up front and if you remember last year there was that there was talk\nThat President Trump was a a Congress was floating this idea of having all catch me should support one case as Ross contributions\nAre not as um a traditional contributions so not tax deferred all tax free growth which is good we'd like tax free girls\nBut we can do like it the Congress mandates that anyway but now Congress is looking around to tax reform ... come up again chairman Kevin Brady Republican from Texas says the ways and Means Committee has no plans\nTo revisit the issue of so called Ross vacation is part of any two point oh proposals and any rumors to the country\nAre simply not correct vote somebody somebody brings up yeah that's where they have to fly the saying\nA younger workers especially she'll be play money to last for one case and he says but that being said ed slot here says that being says a bigger raw supported the number one worry among the financial advisors and consumers\nEffect they don't trust Congress [laughter] imagine that Congress said no we're not thinking about do worry about we got her backside yeah right yeah you know you're getting screwed big surprise you uh do like the idea there off\nA but they think that Congress double cross them and changed the rules to find some way to tax these raw funds and if that's a valid concern I think so too what they say is that you put the money in tax taxable to pay the tax of ... oldest whistle Congress gets their money yeah I knew there I pay taxes are amped up and they're hungry for revenue\nYou know if you're a spouse it's one set of rules non spouses and it's a different set of rules um first and foremost there's the keys step that Irene owners need to take name the heirs and your company fishery form\nSpouses will eventually inherited Mary anyway but it's it's a simple matter to make it clear by designating a spouse on the forum\nFor non ... can we designate more than just\nThe ... you can but in the state of Wisconsin good luck with the ... the name somebody other the dawn she has to sign off on that\n[laughter] not finding any I Know\nYou've got to be a little bit careful with that followed him is that because we are married lasik stupid yes [laughter] yeah well that and that can vary state to state\nYes oh yes some you were able to do without the specific you didn't sign is formed on why is it about how they don't they don't even know that just fighting aside raised years yeah I'm sure it well she does you better do that [laughter] she would not sign for ...\nYears of being named on the form is critical because that designation allows them to stretch out the distribution somebody ... over their lifetimes if you don't list any ... beneficiaries or name your state the irate can't be stretch and the tax shelters last\nSo in other words if you have kids named the kids\nThose that's those are what's considered non spouse beneficiaries if you just say Don first and then the state no he just blew it man is critical Jeff\nSo not only would there's benefit from years of growth but drawing the money out over time mitigate the tax bill produced by cashing out of the traditional Irish and as we talked about earlier a lot of times people will just take money out of this lump sum while you just get creamed in Texas and that's not the best thing to do\nSome ... like winning the lottery when he'd taken a lump sum or right yes you have the the choice right most people want the lump sum they went all the money while they got depends ... several hundred million dollars I'll pay the taxes\nOn that thousand dollar lottery bank and the state giving me the money some time in the future especially if it's in Illinois Lottery asking for trouble aren't they're not that there's anything wrong with Illinois our listeners from Illinois you know let them know but they they're broke right now yeah trouble\nBut you're ... you have to be careful how you take the money but if the air's take the money all at once\nA he or she would lose a lot to taxes this also allows you to spread the taxes out of your life expectancy which is a great way to go smoke one more important notes ... owners keep that beneficiary form up there because the beneficiary form Trump's a well that's really important\nThat you know especially if you're a have multiple spouses or a spouse dies you have to make sure that you update\nYou know your beneficial designation forms\nOne of the most important things to know is that the IRA passes outside the state so if you're able to name a beneficiary if not included as part of the tax will stay that's exclude from airs everything from a creditors so that if you have to be careful with the\nLast ... uh beneficiary that's typically not a problem when a non\nSpouse isn't there even if you think non Muslims my family\nThat was still not a spouse it's your kid yeah a pronounced ... beneficial is whether it's a child cousin friend or whoever the rules for inheriting in that area are very different story\nAs designated beneficiaries non spouses cars stretched inherited diary over their lifetimes but only if the carefully follow number of rules messes step and the opportunity to make that Iran ... last forever will be gone\nAnd they just have to make sure that the ears and noses make it clear to your beneficiary that just not going to happen automatically know the rules all required minimum beneficiary designate a are these the arm de required minimum distribution are the rules are not the same the numbers are not the same you just have to be\nCareful with that and if I can give you a warning in this segment\nUpdate your beneficiary forms make sure the ... one of the beneficiaries are named in their cars and they have an opportunity there are a lot of good attorneys out there that'll do irate beneficiary trust so if you want some strings attached you can get some of the benefits a stretch irate in a trust it just has to be done properly\nAt great advice to update those forms I just interject a little humor here at the end of the segment job you know much I Love Seinfeld right [laughter]\nDo your middle yeah talking about Don finding that form well do you remember when George is trying to get out of the wedding with Susan his girlfriend so he had to play around with Seinfeld to come up with a prenuptial agreements said have her Senate Purina for bringing up she'll she'll get mad and you won't have to worry about Mary [laughter]\nSo he brings up Susan shoot me than a ... you don't have a dime her parents were loaded they're paying for all five [laughter]\nAnd walked out the room you have to be careful what you wish for ... exactly it backfired on George as

Don Larsen of the New York Yankees pitches a person no hitter in the history of the\nWorld Series even better it was a perfect game\nTo this day no other pitcher has had a no hitter in the world

edition but jumping tore interview with Olivia Newt see she's Washington correspondent for New York magazine we're talking about her interview with President Trump but we started off with the whole ... story and asking why he was there in the first place [laughter] little attention\nReally humid there to talk about criminal justice reform remember his life Kamkar dashing last including president back in your early cheering she can you stand in for a woman who had been in prison since like Nineteen Ninety six on a drug charge\nAnd the bread and get that and I got a lot of positive press for that it it\nKind of one of these rare non controversial things he did and I think that he is is that people to ... ... and that's probably cynically part of why he wants to continue hearing this sort of thing and his son in law Jared Kushner who's the top White House advisor at may criminal justice\nReform wanted his central issues and so\nIt gets reported earlier this week the ... should be coming in to speak the president and that was like main topic that\nThey were supposed to be covering but of course ... has been out there very controversial early very openly supporting Donald Trump over the last month and booth recently on that now wearing a make America great again hat wearing it everywhere and he was wearing it today and it it's really funny\nIn the oval office I just kept thinking\nThat it still unusual because a Donald Trump did not the most puzzling figures sitting here in the oval office today he was the most talkative person then you have a lot it's if it's sort of a monologue from Kanye West he was also not the Martin burying the make America great again hat so it's very weird\nWas so interesting watching the video because the president's sitting behind a desk and he has his hands class and he's just looking\nIn a con you go off and it was just like quietly nodding his head like you said she was really strange\nAnd you know you have more outlandish character in their ... just went off and it was yeah much like the ... of passwords stream of consciousness and he's just going on and and he sort\nOf out Trump Trump and the president speaks that way too though where he speaks in the stream of consciousness he touches on all different topics I mean I had as you mentioned before firsthand experience with that earlier this week with a lot of it but I had a better view of the president whereas\nStanding in the oval than I did a con game but I I could see them both and it was just so interesting to watch\nHow the president was just completely\nDazzled and confused\nAt the same time but what was happening\nSilent I mean he did ... ...\nMile only a couple of times you know it was about ten minutes\nAnd he spoke initially when I first walked in he was speaking he was saying that the accent I felt player who was there along the ... I was actually a better lacrosse player and I don't know anything about sports I don't have any idea that true or not and then he started talking a bit about\nWhat he can hit the compliments and he talked about North Korea and I I wrote it down because it was so funny but\nWhen the president spoke about North Korea Kanye West responded he said quote\nI like the north Korea\n[laughter] I'm like okay I don't know I\nKnow I think maybe he meant like you like the policy on North Korea\nBut it is a funny yeah but then yeah and it's all gone\nYeah yeah and as you mentioned you know she was wearing a make America great again hat you know he mentioned that specifically said that Donald Trump gave him the power you know he made them feel like Superman it was that Superman case that he had he talked about that he talked about his own mental health saying I'm not bipolar\nI got another doctor to see me or something even brought on his phone we know we just pass code now zero zero zero zero and he said you know can we get rid of the air force one we want to\nDo this I point one [laughter] you\nKnow I think some people say oh is the president bleeding and the mentally ill person after after\nCalling you a globe that about himself in the closet and I think that's just\nSort of bullshit mentally ill people people who have mental illness that it doesn't mean that they're not\nAutonomous human beings and that they can't make their own version then that they should be baby fat or are treated as though they're not intelligent you know I think they're just simplistic productive way to talk about mental illness and I saw that narrative taking off a little bit after that meeting and I found it really troubling\nTotally disagree with that also I mean as crazy as con you can be a times use a very smart man he knows what he's doing in a sense he's very conscious of himself and his kind of role in popular culture I don't think he's being taken advantage of in the slightest\nWe are making that kind of it that there is such a gift and that that I think it's irresponsible to take any kind of get about what his true state of land in and I I just wanted to make sure we were talking about that\nDo it yeah overall it would make particularly bizarre and even the president will she agreed that the dollar which is really saying that\nThey can win Connie wrapped up the president you could just feel the relief that he's done him and he says\nSo you would that was pretty impressive that was why something and you know what is jealous yeah everybody's on board with that same thing\nCompany with local service in support when you get Medicare supplement cards were you traveling the laugh with whatever Medicare doctor you choose UPS rates are stable and most Iraq it over time\nLike it's a very thick membership vision and hearing\nDiscount program you might qualify for some extra discounts to to take advantage of optional foreign travel emergency coverage that long\nYou get to where we free coverage me UPS Medicare supplement insurance plans for the most popular ...

[noise] this is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and running down some of the top stories of the week don't get the check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] one of the most dramatic\nStories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts and had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something\nFailed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets these soy use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubled Russian space program\nIt's the only thing that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when USS not one cause not go up the space station and they're in the ...\nSpace craft which also writes up on a rocket at the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station gr we're going to come back now the space station always has the story is capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official\nSeal of approval on that are coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew\nOr not it didn't\nSo apparently what happened is it made it through about two minutes of flight ... staging per se just second stage or what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have drugged aging but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells me there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either\nAn engine failed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nOther rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age woke on our side and the the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have it aboard option until much later than when you were bored your ground control punches a big red button and a capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burn ... seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete right in the face\nThey said they were forced to do a ... entry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that stuff that that that have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot and even in a normal retrieve you're you're looking at maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so\n... means that this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nAbbas stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in ... a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle and away the ... design and such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways met heat shield so it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to\nFive sometimes six cheese a ballistic originally just means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you head goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet and because you're not ascribing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine cheese which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission what are riding with a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten afternoon and they showed some video the offense\nAnd at the point that whatever happened happened that started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you can see these two guys are hands are flap on around like they're trying to learn how to apply them and it's really it's almost comical but realize it was a top ride because normally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even before\nThey hit the panic buttons cut out\nNo other way now these are rushing saw you spacecrafts generally they're pretty reliable as when I said I Know they had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening to SpaceX has a capsule getting ready Boeing has another one also what do we know about these\nSo ... has been flying since Nineteen sixty seven and its flown a hundred and forty five times so although that's actually not that many more than the shuttle it's been very successful they only had two crew losses back in the sixties and then after that\nA few issues but generally it's been extremely reliable as it's been around long times\nRussia has launched an investigation of see what happened and they said that they're going to you know share all the details with everybody because\nWe still have a partnership with them so we'll see what the true cause of that was but thank you very much Rob pile space historian author catch all of his stuff piled books dot com thank you for joining us sure [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nThe most concerning stories that happened this past week\nWas a report about nursing homes you know a lot of people have\nAging parents are just elderly family members and a lot of times they have no other recourse but to put them into nursing homes um the you know they might need help operating in daily life so there was a study that came out that says that some nursing home residents are increasingly spending time\nIn rehabilitation treatment during the last days of their lives are being subjected to potentially unnecessary therapies\nThat are really reaping significant financial benefits for the facilities themselves it's a thing called ultra high intensity rehabilitation and has to do with you know the amount of time that they're going through the rehab\nIt just draws all the questions that I mean the main concern is\nIf these people are in a facility and you know the elderly and you know they're reaching the end of their lives why would you put them through some of these rehabilitation techniques\nSo we're supposed to Riley Griffin she's a reporter for Bloomberg News and she knows all about this study and we started off by asking her what does ultra high intensity rehabilitation mean\nThis study found that the proportion of the nursing home residents who received ultra high intensity rehab increased by a whopping sixty five percent between twenty twelve and twenty sixteen but let me back\nUltra high intensity rehabilitation therapy is a classification that is used to designate the amount of treatment given to a skilled nursing home patient\nWhat that designation ultra high means it actually treatment that exceed seven hundred and twenty minutes a week of therapy or more which can range from speech therapy to physical therapy but the point to underscore here is that more than twelve hours a week so it's highly intensive and we're seeing an increase across the board\nWell ultra high therapy isn't bad enough that sell what's concerning is that residents were found to be treated with this high confidence rehab during their berry last week of life and the author of studies suggest that this could have\nBeen interfering with patients ability to get other forms of care like all\nRight I think that would be the main concern is if you're treating them obviously there are patients there at the nursing home you know the status of their health\nAnd if they seem to be in the latter days of their life why would you be putting them through some of this intensive therapy rather than doing some of the other stuff you know making them more comfortable the hospice care all those other things what does this ultra high intensive rehabilitation consist of though what are they doing to the patient\nBasically ultra high it's just a nation that refers to time what they're doing is a form of therapy that ranges from speech therapy to physical therapy so helping patient Rene learn how to eat or move their legs in a certain way but it's the ultra high referred to be an out of ... and\nIt sounds maybe a little while to say but if they are in the final days why put them through this stuff anyways\nThe other and how do you think that they are two possibilities one is that in nursing homes simply don't know that their patients are in the very last stages of their life but the other possibility which is", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "13"}
