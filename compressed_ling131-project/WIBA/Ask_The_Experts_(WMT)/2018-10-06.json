beauty\nWhen we help accident victims we fight to get them full justice nothing what\nThat means all of the law says your injuries cause medical\nYou know it we don't I guess we don't just do that inside worked for the new construction too we also um [noise] you know frame you know a hundred and twenty five thousand a year so that's you know the ... take the ... foundation ... stick building it up until there is a rough on it we do that already so like you said the pieces are there it's really not that hard for us to do it\nAnd when you mentioned pieces too I also think a lot of times we talk remodeling I Know one of the things that you really enjoy is is making the pieces fit and you're kind of you know with with a house that's already built that you're doing remodeling\n... there's there's a lot of okay how was this going to function within a basic structure I've got to assume with a with a starting on a you know with a nice piece of paper or probably on a computer screen\nIt's gotta be nice to have some a little more okay sit sit down what do you want to what are you invasion of this house and and there's got to be a lot obviously the the remodeling stuff's a lot of fun this has got to be a lot of fun for you guys as well\nIt does you know it's always a learning process and and I think our approach to it when we do it you know get involved in a new house is pretty different from what we see on the you know for normally Indian county [noise] I mean when we when we normally see is is extremely fast paced um\nYou know there's there's really not much upfront you're usually chosen from a standard plan you might get to modify a little bit um [noise] but that whole process goes pretty quick I mean\nI don't know if there's a ton of discussion about how people live and what their goals are and how long we're going to stay in all those things [noise] um it's more you know\nYou like this basic design or to you know pick pieces in parts to immerse like things to throw in there [noise] um that complete the design\nBut uh um you know and remodeling we our approach is so different than that I mean where\nSo I think we have a ... approach to building a new house because we're now we're we're we have the time to rally we have the time to to really put a lot of design effort in and uh it's very fun to do it on a I'm In a new house when we get a chance also\nI ... is is you're kinda describing how you know a lot of houses are built these days is kind of a modular approach I guess probably it it kind of reminds me of um you know\nKind of like cut and paste is concerned and like I like the look of that some of pull at in and out of like the look of this and I I Want one of these\nAre these does does doing this you know these occasional ... you know new home project it's got to help you guys as well just just as a as you know as carpenters and is is designers is having this having this kind of different uh you know kind of a a different approach of\nOf being involved in in the design from start to finish mentioned obviously all the work you do with some of the the area builders in in you know you're kind of working within you know our part yeah you're kind of doing your part whereas with this stuff I mean especially for the guys that don't get to do it's got to be a pretty exciting in in ... and ... and a lot of fun\nIt is a lot of fun and and surprisingly predictable like [laughter] it's like ... you know we've all the shows you just don't always know what's your what's your get into it you know a couple of days ago we didn't find walked around the kitchen um it was for a past customer we had done their basement awhile you know maybe a year or two ago\nAnd now we have called ascend into their kitchen\nAnd this kitchen was um I mean we got it done and sixty days\nWhich I you know it was really quick for what we had to do the pictures will be popping up bomb hopefully next week but um [noise] there that you know it was a very challenging remodeled it just seemed like everything we opened up was like now we want to wind down this wall and it looks like there's nothing in there and then we open it up and it's got it's packed stuff\nAnd um we pulled the ... I'm sure we have pictures um I don't know if we should post or not but [noise]\nYou know I had this false sense of security because\nYou know a ... a lot of the times ... in the last year or so and we ... you know what I'm Talking about science in the kitchen\nA you know they were pretty clear sale and there wasn't on a lot and um there there was there was a you know no pipes maybe a ... and move but [noise]\nUh this one of the guys called me and said I think you've got to come over here oh no I don't know [laughter] well as we all ... up in a lot of stuff and I saw you know come on [laughter] to to put wind [laughter] and uh\nNow that may sent me pictures and I it was it was pretty crazy like a whenever this house got build every every trade ran everything through there just wasn't a whole lot a\nLot of planning but um you know and my point is when you build a new house and it's actually ... in our world is kind of a you know it's a lot easier than it seems like there's less pressure once you start to construction process I think the design should really feel the same I mean you do it all the same things right and\nMaybe there should be even a little more pressure on a new laws because you're you have a chance to actually get it right [laughter] you know [laughter] and I you know we we can come in and Monday morning quarterback on her a model I go there you know why they do this we should you know [noise]\nUm you know and then now is our chance to fix it so\nAre you hearing from more more previous you know whether it was people that you were modeled for maybe did an addition for are you hearing I we ... we it's kind of the economy really I think a lot of us the same booming\nAre you getting more people saying you know what we've had this idea for a long time we want we've had this this great vision for the kind of house we won a are you are you getting hearing for more people now that are kind of saying let's let's let's do this let's take a peek yeah\nYeah

[laughter] [laughter] but obviously as as you point out definitely is a very very important part of the process was talking about the part that I think a lot of people are\nProbably ... aside from moving day I'm the most excited about which is some of that design and some of that um lay out or looking at uh one of the one of the notes that like somebody a sketch some some stuff I'm like a post it note do you ever get does every kind of past that point now posted no yeah just felt\nLike you have children in the past uh you know I remember probably Twenty years ago walking\nIn um with the hand drawn footprint outta posted\nNo I I'm pretty sure I got a permit to build on this one at a time [noise] and it posted on so I I don't know if that inspector is still in the game but I'm assuming he's retired now but yeah the rules are a little time now I have to have a legit plans which thank goodness we can do\nIt we've come a long way from that so how does that kind of work with with ... with this wrong it started\nRight yeah so a lot of it is starting somewhat you know there's there's different aspects to it so that that thing where we're asking you all these questions about how you live [noise] that and and what you want you know out of your house a lot of that pertains to they'll lay out in the inside of the house or is that part um\nThere's also a big thing that plays in as we want to yeah I really enjoyed trying to build a house that fits the lot ah we're we're one coming up\nThat isn't a it's a very wooded and it's like I kind of a hillside uh it's kind of a little bit uh I don't say ... the home or not ... but [noise] um the style of house or going to build and the you know the shape of the house is going to lend itself well if you looked like it fits in [noise]\nAnd um I you know that takes some thought process now with the Internet you know we talk about how this for bathroom kitchen and baseball you can\nEven find very cool stuff on you know for plans and how to lay out things and and even just the style and you know how the outside of the house looks\nUm so so we're right away are giving people jobs okay you need to\nWe want you want you to give us five or six that you like um and then we're gonna we're going to do the same thing we're gonna try and come up with some that we like and we think that a lot and you know we know that some of those get pitched out right away but but we're going to probably is going to make it easier to find out you know to to get to the end goal\nWas in and you mentioned a house as good as I Know I even see an interest which I was surprised when I saw like things like a lake house design and stuff like that I mean it's there's a lot of people love sharing that kind of information\nThey do and it's and it's made it very cool I I um I think it's for what it is is great and you know there's a lot of times people say\nYou know I found this plan I mostly like it I'm not sure why I don't like this and this and you know it kind of gives you that starting point uh you don't have to necessarily redesigned the wheel I mean\nBy the same token some of these plants somebody's really traditional plans don't lend itself well to the inside of the house those those goals things that we have set up you know like the type of kitchen you want and\nUm our best advice believe me is make those before make those decisions before construction starts\nI noticed that um you know we've got one fairly big customer in town that does a great job and I'm turn it on home builder does great job and gets everybody decided that stuff before they break ground um you know it's a lot less stressful for a homeowner to to put all that to bed and now just let the construction process happen\nUm it's also more predictable for the bill or which probably means that it's going to be you know that's gonna affect the budget in a positive way\nUm we do it on our models which I don't you know I don't I don't know anybody that does that but the reason it is for all those same reasons right if we know what we're supposed to do you know what you're going to get 'em now even accurate contract if you leave decisions too you know after the contract after you dig\nNow all of a sudden you know like what's the price what what is it going to be done how does this affect the time period\nOr we don't we don't know that stuff um\nThat that it is a daunting task a little bit I'm In a kitchen remodel a will just count up the colors that are in their uh you've got flooring cabinets countertops\nPaint colors a you've got Kevin hardware\nYou got trim you know your windows and doors or whatever and uh what else oh appliances cars appliances can be stainless white black men got that gun metal color and there's a lot going on so that ... you know that whole house that's where we really need\n'em an effective design or somebody that's really good on the design end to kind of most people need this help to to whether it's just to be a sounding board or actually you know help steer them through that process or so that they're not you know getting off track on design I mean like\nWhen you have this goal of design you know that you can see it way out there in the future um\nYou still need a tractor and on and it's very easy to to get off track and not end up with what you really want it\nVery and it's a stick to it when we talk about some of the sexes or they're also selections to maybe less in obviously the cosmetic stuff that you see and stuff do you use in the you know the surfaces are very important what\nAbout other selection as far as like lifestyle type things I Know we've talked this part of like remodeled things like high speed Dana ports and those type of things um when you're building new I I've got to assume that there's some great opportunities there to kinda cater to the type of\nPerson you are and make some of those upgrades of of things that maybe not traditionally you you might find in ... new construction\nRight to the data perch especially the ones that we do\nUm I think they're cats six now their their use were running wires everywhere or one we have things open up in it and if I was built a new house I would make sure you know they've they've we've we have found and they make you know fairly attractive and points for these now\nOr that you know you can you can have everything you need right there um you know and and people that are that are tech savvy are definitely asking for those things I think if I didn't get builders should be explaining what those are and offering those do because it's much cheaper to do it obviously when you're in ... you know\nDidn't that construction phase rather than trying to add that later um sometimes I'll leave that stuff to the electoral walked through 'em and that's when the houses stick built but not drive old are you going to walk through it with our church and we do this also but\nYou know mostly we're adding small things we're not saying okay now we want twenty five data parts or [laughter] you know we want a a third more lighting or you know I think a lot of that can be figured out ahead of time and um and then I kind of clears the path so that everybody knows what they're doing\nWhat are you mentioned ... selections and you mentioned kind of the stick build when you've got all you know all the the wood and stuff in places is is that kind of a a time where people are kind of getting the fuel also you they come on in and kind of walk around the guy and kind of get a deal that we've seen it on paper and we've seen that the progress but now we can actually see where these rooms are going to be and how it all fits together\nVery very much so and and that that uh you know we ... we don't uh\nBut as people to come\nYou know until there's a real fun to be honest because\nYou know it's just not a safe job site um you know our our ... our our our Malik good but they're fast I mean we're we're generally\nYou know week and a half a they're they pretty much have tar paper on windows cell wow goes fairly quick um so we don't want to you know the better the plant is the less you know she made changes everything should be flushed out\nUm and then it's then it's a safe job site and why should we cleaned up um you know the like sort of represented nothing's going to fall on your head a you're not gonna be walking on a nice sharp nails but um [noise] you know that is a time to to walk in and start getting a feel for to see what these rooms are going to feel like\n... you mentioned that you know how fast you guys are working in in the great work that they do a one of the things we often talk about during remodeling projects is kind of balance of 'em\nHome life and work life are actually out because the house becomes a job site this there's got to do with new construction has got to be a convenience that kind of moving\nFaster more efficiently because you don't have to worry about 'em you know which rooms the dog going to be in and and the are the you know the family going to be home do you need the space you guys can can get in there and and go go go\nYeah and you know like a you know I've I've talked to our people our time and were but when we budget or a model that somebody's living in we budget about Fifteen Percent of our time for cleaning up because we know that if somebody walks through mess over here and goes to the other non construction zone of the house\nThey're gonna during that mess with them so you just spend a lot of time you clean it up um you know and that news site uh it doesn't quite after me you want to clean enough to be safe but you know they hit it hard when it when it when there's a trade changed you know after after framing the house and goes to the mechanical as there is a good clean up the happens\nVery very cool and it and we mentioned to the selections ... ... talk also some of the previous shows as well about the hardware and uh\nAnd done flooring and all of a self great opportunities there an edge construction company dot com it could not listen to some of those previous shows you can also even better check

I've been in a two car accidents with friends and both times the car was totaled it's gotta be kinda high I'm going to guess twenty percent\nYeah you're right you're right in the ballpark Eighteen is the official number All right here we go and this is what we're talking about when it comes to income what are the odds of you needing to be in some sort of long term care facility you know what those odds are\nUh it's probably not going to happen every once it's got to be kind of low I'm ago twenty ... twenty five percent\nYou would be wrong ceded too out of three but in this case the ... the odds are Seventy two percent\nSeventy two percent chance that you're going to need some sort of long term care facility whether it's for rehab like you have a surgery or for me or hip or whether it's being in the nursing home full fledge\nFolks those are big numbers those are numbers that are largely at risk of your assets that your assets creed doesn't come so you know what do we ensure ourselves for health care yeah being I mean her insurance ... and do we ensure ourselves for automobiles\nPete I enter my my car I also have ah insurance on my house and you know just 'cause just 'cause I'm the cautious type I even have an umbrella policy just to protect anything else that I missed\nSo what you're telling me is things that are really important to you you\nInsure them of course Pete so then my question is if there's so much risk associated\nWith income in retirement why don't so many people ensure their retirement income\nIt's a great question it is a great question right I mean have they thought about that before look you can ensure things you can manage them or you can ignore them the reality is most people have a tendency to ignore things\nThen if they've ignored 'em long enough they think they can manage their way through risk\nTo get to where they should have been had the insured it right up front\nFolks who we are talking about is your income for the rest of your life\nThere's a lot of risk out there we just mentioned one long term care\nWhat about it and will actually mentioned to outlive your money longevity and long term care long term care what about inflation risks what about deflation risk what if you withdraw too much money early on in your retirement early on and on retirement where do we call those the go go ...\nThat's where we're playing golf Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday taking that Cruz taken it taken a cruise going to the Bahamas seeing the grandkids traveling around you're on the go right you know what I might even by an RV um I'll do that right I Want to see the u._s._a.\nThat's right we're going to go to all the national parks and hanging out that's my goal the fact is folks that there's all these risks associated\nAnd it's our responsibility to replace that income\nRight now is the time you know that pen and paper we told people to get together if you're not taking notes on those statistics already to time to write down this phone number six or eight to one to seven three zero zero\nSix early two one two seven three zero zero folks if this is hitting home and you don't know if you have an income playing do you have an investment play on the long term care plan how about a tax plan\nYou have a legacy plan you have all these put together do you have a coach or an architect to help you through if you don't it's time to pick up that phone give us a call six zero eight two one two seven three zero zero are shameless plug six zero eight two one two Seventy three hundred\nAnd folks we will ah if you call in it's for the first five callers only and just wanted to remind you that you will be leaving a voice mail or beginning back to Monday morning up though\nWe're giving them the weekend off now they liked it so much why not that's right well you know a little taste or retirement on the weekends when it comes to the weekend that we talk about retirement\nHow many when you're working folks think about this how many Saturday is are there are per week Pete there's just one Saturday there's just one right yeah there's just one what day do you spend the most money on fear in the week\nSaturday That's when my wife wants to go shopping wants to fix stuff up on the house\nDo just your go boating ... cup that write all our hobbies all those things that take place on the weekend when you're retired how many Saturdays we'd be have\nYou have seven seven every day's a Saturday\nWhat about your long term care all these things are enormous risks that we face out there folks ... one of the risks pure income is this thing called sequence of returns\nRisk if you ever heard of that before making pie I'm going to pretend to have it and so you can explain that to hitch a ride be so you've had to have heard about giving you a hard time keep going but folks do realize that the order of returns the sequence of them\nActually makes a difference in your spending ability let me give me an example let's say you're early retirement\nOr let's say you're sixty five you just retired you're sixty seven years old now and the market does that had her so you have a hundred dollars but we'll have more than a hundred dollars so we have a billion dollars okay a million dollars live a million dollars in we drop what the market fifty percent now we're down to five hundred thousand yep okay\nThat next year the market comes back and guess what dude where again not a fifty percent right back oh yeah they had a million that's right that's why we're in the market right could I could always goes up and we're really happy\nWait did I just say we got back up to ... million\nThat's right you did that what we did is we gained fifty percent we lost fifty percent one year that would deem fifty percent but if we can gain fifty percent start with a million were down to five hundred thousand that fifty percent wasn't on the million was\nNo this is on the five hundred thousand feet so what does that put us at the time I checked my calculator correctly that seven hundred and fifty thousand that\nPuts as a seven hundred and fifty thousand now remember when you had that million you are planning on taking fifty thousand dollars a year out of there\nOkay oh okay well take a fifty thousand dollars a year 'cause we've got a happy retirement income stream we think we have coming out of that money out of the market now all of a sudden it's down to fifty thousand five hundred thousand you're going to still taste that fifty thousand dollars out\nA no there's no way am I'll make my whole retirement what that take out that much money\nIt's tough isn't it so now let's say we took our fifty thousand out we're down to four hundred and fifty thousand so that fifty percent game\nReally now are only up to about sixty seven thousand six hundred and Seventy thousand dollars and if we're still going to be taken fifty thousand dollars a year what do you think your success rate is getting back up to just a million dollars where you started\nIt's got to be pretty low it's very difficult now what happens if you turn those numbers around you have a million dollars and get a fifty percent game\nYou're at one point five oh yeah we're we're living good no yep\nWe take our five hundred fifty or fifty thousand dollars a year off of that weren't happy\nYou now have a fifty percent loss they'll look it's still rough we're still down to seven hundred and fifty thousand is right\nNot not nearly as bad but it still hurts still you might just get that opportunity to get back to a million dollars folks big losses early in retirement hurt you bad also the sequence of return hurts you bad go ahead\nI was just gonna say does that mean we average zero\nWell yeah we average zero but our principal is zero right\nOh my gosh yeah I'm just thinking that through Pete sorry I just wanted to point that out we average zero but we ended up at ... we ended up behind ... situations\nFolks this is so imperative it's that's a big word for the right to paired it's so important for us to understand these concepts secure your income\nMake sure you're in a position not to outlive your income don't derive all your income when we build a house the roof is exposed to the financial storm so financial house\nThe foundation principle protected safe secure not in the market\nSeparate that money understand what you're building you're not building a pie chart\nYou're building a financial house you're building a house that you will live in financially for the next twenty to Thirty years twenty to Thirty years of unemployment where it's your responsibility to create those paychecks you know what what's that is a good time for people to pick up the phone and give us a call\nSix to one to Seventy three hundred six or eight to one to seven three zero zero but it's just for the first by callers call get a complement to revisit come in and see if see if you've got

plan to do it do you have a complete play on it is not just about in complaining cause your investments the ups and downs that affects your income right or can depending on how your set up\nLong term care health care notices when taxes on my gosh taxes we could talk about taxes as long as we talked about income come debate don't get too excited I'm I'm pretty pumped or anything but we're now at

related to a personal story of mine and this has to do with a woman who ah was on a train and it was so drunk that she had no memory of uh an incident where she was screwing the guy next to her\nAnd a sixteen year old fellow passenger was so shocked she immediately called the police\nAnd uh she was she said I didn't\nDo it I have no memory of doing it I don't know I did it and they showed her the CCTV they video every I inside every train in England and they were they show her her ... this guy\nIn front of everybody on the train seat\nFor ... for D. or whatever the hell seat right and so ah she at first of course denied out raging public\nDecency in engaging in sexual activity in public but then after seeing of course CCTV or the defense switched\nOver to the fact she was so drunk she had no idea what she was doing she had recently broken up with their partner and resorted to regular binge drinking sessions to deal with the heartbreak and uh she is in their version of a and had not had a drinks into rehab program\nUh but the judge said that I'm delighted but remember you also did this in front of a sixteen year old a that is some effect\nOn her the sixteen year old so she was given twelve months of community service a hundred and twenty hours of unpaid community work and Fifteen days rehab and then a few hundred dollars in a\nIn a fine she had to pay now or the story I Want to share with you and this is not legal story but it's just a story somewhat came to this I was on a cruise or and I cruise with a lot of people I used to and there was a couple who were engaged to be married and they were not youngsters\nI mean they were in there are I think he was in his sixties at the time she was in her forties and we're on the cruise in one night\nThey decided to play Titanic so they go to the bottom of the ship and just\nRip their clothes off and just start screwing their brains up ah screwing their brains out right there in front of the ship next morning we're a breakfast and I said uh you know I was pretty impressive last night the two of you\nAnd they said how ... how did you know did you see it and I said the ... camera half the ship was watching\nNot only were they not embarrassed they thought that was the greatest thing in the world and they talked about that at the wedding and they actually asked the ship if they could have the video and the ship did not keep the video unfortunately\nThere's rice or it's a great story event of a\nScrewing in public places okay now for those who incidentally who have hurt every story of mine and uh you know who I'm Talking to everybody who stored every story of mine I bet you haven't heard that one yet\nHey that's due right okay fair enough that was Blake saying yeah All right ah we're done with that let's take some phone calls okay Hi David let's start with you welcome to handle on the la Hi David\nYes sir I gotta I gotta wear my three year old daughter was running in a bar in the target store and there were like oh why part but one of the\nHistory to it wasn't the rotisserie chicken machine that was where they keep it after it's already cooked they keep it warm\nAnd she fell and she hit her lip and that she got a bunch of burn on her arm in at her hand and they look pretty disfiguring for my wife had taken a girl for the hospital and the doctors that yet and second or third degree burns on her\nAnd their arms and ah I Know we should get compensated or the medical bills but I'm Wondering if there's anything well I'm not looking to get rich or anything I Want to know if there's anything more besides just\nYeah there is ... ... let's talk about what actually happened and where this a war being a device was it was was one of those warming counters yeah okay so she ends up tripping and I'm assuming it's a on the aisle correct\nCorrect okay so ah yeah okay so I've seen those a million times and matter of fact to store I go to has a matter of fact has the big chicken machine a behind the counter and then the counter itself is a a warming counter and so she trips\nOr just in the aisle and hits her lip on the actual a counter space right some kind of a railing or something on the counter space or\nShe she went to a break or fall and her arms and ... and ... and ... that she wants to\nBreak what you're talking about hit hit the outside of it the one that was on the aisle correct yeah okay and I'm just curious as to what she fell on\nThe new I Know what the other night and not that really not that it really matters or the answer is yes she has a case and\nA couple of reasons uh first of all ah it it is if it's just figure ... going to be disfigured for sort of forever\nA short of plastic surgery yeah she's a she actually has a pretty good case so it's a it's not going to be we're not talking hundreds of thousands of dollars while we're talking about pretty good chunk of money\nAll right and you have plenty of time or because the statute of limitations for her doesn't run out ah until one she hit Eighteen that's when it starts to go in other words up to Eighteen and then let's say the statute is three more years she has until Twenty one to file suit\nAnd ... and here's the argument I Would make it's not so much even a three year old anybody bumping a a just a bumping into that device scraping passed it brushing past it if it's hot enough to cause those kinds of\nBurns what the hell was doing on the oil\nI mean that's the issue I I go past or those aisles all the time and the railing and we're talking about the railing we're talking about ah the aluminum and steel uh that's the bottom sort of the base board but a between the glass and uh\nYeah I'm trying to try to describe this but I I'm not good at making living with words as you know anyway if you touch that it's\nWarm I mean there's no question but not hot enough to burn you so yeah\nThey'll pay for the medical bills or you've got plenty of time you want to wait until it's old finished in done a and a talk to a plastic surgeon or to you know you've got yourself the case there I'm assuming it is is it with a against a major brand or the supermarket\nTarget and I I wasn't ordinance for for me to get pictures of that area where it happened\nIt wouldn't hurt you know it doesn't hurt\nBut what are they going to say uh no we didn't have it uh no it wasn't that hot yeah look at look at her face and look at her hands it wasn't that hot really ah yeah they don't have my yeah go ahead and take pictures of it it doesn't really matter a budget by attorney\nUh yeah you want to talk to a ... attorney but there's no rush is what I'm saying but you may want to talk to a PIN attorney just to get you know the right doctors who frankly know how to write this stuff up and do you recommend it to a plastic surgeon yeah go to the Web site go to handle on law dot com and just started asking\nHey David welcome to handle on the law\nHey bill I wanted out if I have a point meant contract states I'm title to eight percent of all of the company's revenue even though they meant to write profit might actually entitled to that level\nNow probably not I mean there are allowed to make a mistake or because to give you eight percent with number one making the highest paid person in the company and and it may just break the company\n\nI mean what if they made let's say it was eight percent what if they put eighty percent by mistake putting an extra zero and didn't pay attention to it does that mean you get eighty percent\nIf my lawyer can get it\nYou're not going to your

what's your quieter already now there were a great team yeah so what what's your question\nMy question is I I feel as though I was abused and that I didn't get a shot at my ... banned the way they treated me Mm\nYeah that's that is a tough one is probably true by the way uh I mean I don't doubt that for a moment based on what you said the history of the recent lawsuits are the problem is you are not abused\nThat's one problem legally I mean it's not a problem that you were not abused it's not it's wonderful they are not abused but at the so you have an issue or as to damages and then the issue becomes\nA look where I Am and if they hadn't done that I Would be where I Would be more successful I Would have been a priest I would've been see the speculation gets pretty high there are the actual physical abuse is something that the law recognizes those are real damages\nA and there's always a statute issue especially from Thirty years ago that becomes really problematic uh but uh in some jurisdictions they just blown open statutes were they retroactively had simply said it's a forever statute which by the way I don't think is legal\nBut the point is that you've got that issue a you've got the damages issue 'cause that's just too speculative\nIt's have you made me feel well maybe you can argue you made me feel like a done ... uh but that is really a statute of limitations problem because okay\nBecause okay even though I felt that way I Would still smart enough to score higher than everyone else but to people in my class\nOkay so you know so I mean\nSo they made me feel like a ... you know my head at some point my father said I Would never graduated college\nOkay and I did so ah people are told all the time they're idiots and we'll never succeed and you're done so and then they go beyond their wildest dreams and success\nWhere's where's the lawsuit there so uh there ain't much there and what saved and I apologize for the phrase oh gee here uh which saved their asses legally is the fact they didn't abuse you and which saved view is\nThe ad or what hurts you legally use you weren't abuse and thank goodness for that and even and even then even then there'd be a statute issue a big one what about what\n... is just one other thing that happened and then I'll just go okay from go from there when I'm let's say I was horsing around\nReally messing around looking around and then get caught and then get punished a lot of times the punishment I'd say at least five to six times was um we get dragged out the other one other person or so it get dragged out at like midnight\nTaken out on the field on the soccer field and may correct to each other for an hour okay\n... be anything well I'm just asking\nI Would I Would argue I read on but it is I Would argue I Would argue that some kind of abuse but it was thirty\nYears ago okay that's your problem it's all Thirty years ago when all of this happened and you know there's an argument that can be made as a matter of fact that's the best thing that ever happened to you or because you in fact rebelled\nAgainst that I mean not to get personal but ah my father always had a problem with me talking too much\nAnd he always had said to me growing up saying no one wants to hear what you have to say uh you have nothing to add to the conversation and ah I rebelled against that and in fact uh my entire life I made my living communicating now\nThat's not to say that people don't believe still that I have nothing to add and no one cares a and I have nothing to add to the conversation and no one cares matter of fact I Would say the majority of people listen to me think exactly that way but my argument against that not only was it not would not be damages\nA that I Would have as a matter of fact it was since the rebellion issue came in ah my damages would be that I'm\nFar more successful than I Would have been\nFor what happened you see it's very speculative it's really weird stuff that goes on

I tend to tell people you know everybody's situation is different if he's got some backup money you know if you've saved if you've had a natural planner which\nI always promote that and especially you know your daughters out of college now and now it's time to get these kids started and you know I don't think everybody told us that when we were kids\nRight to to just go on Social Security pension would be the only thing\nRight that you didn't need to plan for and I think now you know these kids are young even if he put twenty five bucks a month away you know you're starting\nTo seem like much but you get in that habit right right that regime any up it slowly I put it out and get more money my daughter did start a good for her planning and uh I mean I I told Jeff there's so many times it's I don't want to repeat it probably will my grandpa said\nAt age twenty two when I got my first job and then shortly died shortly after this and he didn't really really well is the former dairy farm when I said he said pay yourself first I didn't know what that meant ...\nDidn't know that I feel 'cause how can I pay myself\nBut you're right you know you put money away consistently electronically automatically into retirement plans to investment plans on an ongoing basis and in Social Security is a supplement to that a very important supplement to supplement nonetheless has never was designed to be the only source of income in retirement\nIf we look at the history of Social Security what was it an intended for care\nIt was intended to be a supplement you know and it was started after the depression and people were left with nothing and so now I'm at it's it's a supplement it's to give you something to live on but you were supposed to save or have a pension or whatever\nAnd I think a lot of people you know especially when they're young ... year focusing on your house your kids or maybe traveling or just spending money in general I think it's so important\nFor us as parents to kind of heart but our kids you got to start saving now because it's not so painful and then you don't get into that panic mode in your forties and fifties what am I going to live on\nAnd I know we're going to talk about this later but you know I've been traveling and I kinda like that and if\nI had kind of like traveling and I know\nI hadn't put my money aside you know when I went I went back to work and get some part time jobs I had that go right into savings and perfect living off my attention you know so anything I Do is [noise] um anything I Do work wise I have that go right into savings and it's just become a habit for me\nYou love to travel you can travel without money Carol camp you wouldn't you would not be doing that had you not saved our plan appropriately the best advice is ... ... ... we harp on this all the time one to set up Jeff and it's automatic you really don't think about it you don't it doesn't mean you ignore the that's right yeah\nAnd it's not set it and forget it and that's not too but I Know it's not the impression that you were trying to give but once you put it in there you started good habits and you mentioned that before putting money away on a consistent basis I have to bring up something before we get an e for [laughter]\nAnd we were joking about this before but last night I had a a fifty as a reunion of a of the last time our football team\nOr the championship way but\nA high school reunion bill but the fiftieth anniversary of the last time your high school team which is which I school\nPolaski icicle Milwaukee and coach do affect us is their person he's a wonderful man and he he was the coach and George ... put it together just the as I can mention everybody was there were you in a way that I don't want to date you here\nNow is that when you were in high school I was a younger guy on the team yeah so oh you're on the team yeah and you won what sort of championship city Jesse chance of city Milwaukee\nAnd this last time Polanski one is fifty years ago yeah so that's kind of pathetic but but a lot of schools go decades without winning ever ... yeah yeah I mean there's a lot of coach to fix as part of the state hall of fame fur coat coaches hall of fame and that so it's it's it's kind of neat new we're talking with him about how they didn't have playoffs back then and\nYou know the first he was part of the setting up the playoffs I think around Nineteen Seventy six and now so this is not everything gets a ... and he got the guys together last night yeah I'd in the current ...\nThanks thing in the band back ripe off but I could bring a bad back together [laughter] let's go well you said you know I thought that these people would look old but they look pretty good but there are a lot of good looking people there it's awesome so they're preserved ... help yeah reasonably healthy active as it was pretty\nNeat to see a ... at least they got a championship like I said they're down the Minnesota Vikings why would you want to leave and never won a Super Bowl is as good as they are you in and year out they've never won the super bowl you mentioned callers Jeff um\nDid you finish your plastic fingered yeah the thing to do that with the ... yeah\nTo the people that got together on my high school class reunions coming up next year do I go\nI think they're fund the older you are because you're not really trying to impress anybody any Latino it All right\nYeah yeah I got this job and and I found out that way\nUm so they look at both records but if you're entitled to an additional amount on your spouse's record they'll take an application for that\nBut if I take early retirement for myself at sixty\nTool at my full retirement age will go up to that larger amount\nOr no it does not any time you take an early benefits that's a permanent benefits so that reduction is you know that reduction is going to be permanent\n... even if once she has full retirement age if half of his is more than what she's getting them she wouldn't get any increase\nNo if she's going to get the increase in a in a situation like hers because her husband's going to be retiring this year and then she's going to be retiring after at the point that she retires they would take a look at that\nAnd for that for the amount that you would get on a spouse's record it wouldn't really be worth it to wait 'til full retirement age to claim that you would want to claim it at the same time you're taking your own\n[noise] okay and they didn't you know do crunch the numbers for you and and tell you exactly what you're going to get on each record\nOkay All right very good thing now your work and when that it might fail I Would think in early retirement\nI Know has still not a bad idea\nAnd if you put a pencil to them and may make sense still go early\nYou know depending on and I saw people depending on what other income you have retirement income I mean my husband is going to retire at sixty to two he's just\nHe's in construction and heat excited he's beat oh yeah he's beat up and he but he's kinda bummed because he's feeling like he's really been up from the work you know up and down ladders all we can work and he said I feel like I had all these plans on that I don't know if my body's gotta than me but I said you know maybe once he retire and relax for a while\nYet total sleep for two weeks and any job he'll feel much better that'll come [laughter] [laughter]\nWell a Sunni thank you so much for the call Cindy thank you well we appreciate the call I mean retirement Jeff ... you've talked about this exciting part of our life our own W license noon news director Kenneth ... tired I'm just talking to him and his duty yeah Judy you can because land\nFor it and you heard of him for the last year he's been talking about this so that the ... so he planted he put in for most people who are happy in retirement and happy they're walking away from it the other things planned for in retirement so I have something to do once they walk away or nothing to do if that's what they plan on doing that's okay too\nBut they were from a financial standpoint from an income standpoint tax standpoint everything else\nSo that's why are you know a Columbus group our team address is all areas retirement planning Social Security is one of them castle estate planning long term care types of things that can blindsided you in retirement as well so when you walk away a lot of our clients are pretty happy by walk away from work\nBecause they have a plan that they know what to expect as they walk into retirement and everybody on their team from top to bottom talks the same language\nSurprises yeah and to do it on your own terms like Ken did you know the one I'm retired I'm leaving in radio in this business I mean that's almost unusual him\nA little trouble adjusting um I still sometimes get up and think Ari what am I supposed to do today so when I have things like this to do\nI feel like I have a little bit of a purpose and I volunteer work and I've done some part time jobs but to keep up to date with a busy yeah I'm I'm trying sometimes I'm\nI don't know it's like I don't know what I'm supposed to do what Carroll you can come back on the show anytime you want you know I Wish I were to forty four years for the government and I think I just was so used to from sixteen on you know going in to work every I and that's what you do so it's it's kinda hard though\nBut but then there's other people that they they just know\nWell yeah there's a lot of questions for you so you um you're you're very popular with this audience Carole thank you got a Dell feel next and Terry you're on the retirement clinical Jeff call and Carol ... Hi Terri\nHi Carolyn Jeff thanks for taking my call a Jeff will probably remember from last week I asked a question\nA Medicare oh yeah\nAnd uh um I understand the with Medicare they take ah the last two years of your earnings to determine what a charge you would have for the Medicare insurance [noise] and uh\nIf you happen to be a high earner um you're going to end up with the maximum charge a but what what are the what what would happen in the case of let's say that you were laid off right before your age of sixty five\nWhen you go back in dispute that church girl\nWell there's a ... they consider that a life changing event because like now you're going to retire so there you know if you're say you're making two hundred thousand dollars a year and that's going to put you in that higher wage earner bracket\nBut then you go into retire and when you file your benefits they always ask do you plan on working you know continue working what are you going to earn if those earnings are going to go away then you wouldn't be subject to that larger amount\nA lot of times where that comes into play is if you uh you know sold maybe a large piece of property or maybe coming in come into a big inheritance\nThe amount that they would use would come off of your adjusted gross income on your tax return\nSo it was likely event that's all I Try to go back to the appeal so if they say\nWell you know you don't even really have to appeal it if it's if it's one of those things where when you're retiring you know you just let them know this income is going away and then they're not going to charge you that higher premium based on that\n... okay very good yeah I mean literally go from from you know higher earnings to zero so\nRight and in a case like that then you don't have to worry about that I did I listened to I did listen to um the show last night I don't know why I just well see what they talked about last week and so I thought oh we're going to get semester [laughter]\nAnd here is I Love it vegetarian\nAnd with the Medicare did just wanted to let you know it is not dumped all it is a that's your prescription drug program\nYou know ... yeah yes and I I don't know why it didn't you know why they didn't make a pie but maybe because they had ABC they wanted to go with\nIt was well next and they also but only right thank you very thanks so called her thinking of you and your battery she calls we continue taking your questions on W. i.s Senate W I'd be a retirement clinic hosted by Jeff ... is our guest Carol Rich than and a lot of\nQuestions on retirement Social Security benefits this is Dennis from Manitowoc good morning identity learning\nA I had a question about a political benefits for myself and particularly I guess my wife gets involved in this too I was born before January ... Nineteen fifty four or Ninety three am I correct that I could actually know her\nSocial Security she hasn't got as many benefits as I qualified I had a higher income\nBut I could I Would buy planet or a cake or benefit when she's retirement age and she's actually two years younger than I Am and take half of her benefits that she's dating or Bennett directs also waiting until Seventy for myself in order to get to get\nBetter and re run up to it\nAnd then when I'm Seventy she can qualify for half of my retirement age benefit and then uh if I die for she goes up to the higher mode at eight percent is that correct\nIf you want to do the deemed filing you would've had to have been sixty two by January second of twenty sixteen so if you were sixty two by then you can still do that is naps that's basically gone away\nSo to his wife takes the benefit early and he doesn't take is is there any adjustment to her benefit when he reaches a Seventeen starts taking his benefit\nShe um just to kind of jumped back on what you said in order you know in the old days when people were doing this in order for you to go on her benefit first and take that until you're Seventy and then switched to your own she had to be full retirement age and you had to be full retirement age\nSo then ordered one jumping on somebody else would benefit ... Seventy but if which you can't\nReally do any more um once and the other thing too is a delayed retirement credits which is that eight percent increase right full retirement age until Seventy spouses are not entitled to that widows and widower czar but spouses aren't so if your wife is going to\nExcuse me if your wife is going to take a benefit off of your record the best time for her to do it would be full retirement age if she wants to wait to get a higher benefit because waiting to Seventy isn't going to get her any delayed retirement credits on your record\nThe vitamins that she would be already she ... cake or retirement benefits at sixty six okay when she retires and then uh I wouldn't take mine until seven and a half\nRight and I and I understand you're saying that and my main point with that is that you would have had to have been sixty two by January second of sixteen if you weren't that program is no longer available\nTo but January\nSecond of twenty sixteen after that that program on our way along with the file in the silence suspended direct program has gone to\nOK okay very good I appreciate you always give her office call we can help you with that what your trip\nTo you know and will to delayed retirement credits I just wanna kinda clarify that spouses are not entitled to that but as a widow um you know just a few work until Seventy before you take a benefit than Jane would and you pass away first Jane would be entitled to those delayed retirement credit so at that point\nYeah well she's taking her benefit now\nI'm a big follower Carolyn face but I Do or travel hero every time I see it don't even says oh she's travelling we get our news but that Trump is what\nPeople look forward to and retired and you talk about the cultural aspect and see different cultures and talk to people in different areas you talked about the value of traveling how just to expand your mind especially retirement you think about what am I going to do in retirement this was one of the great things that that my clients a lot of people I'm sure plan for\nAnd we ask how's your income how's your health any trouble plants ... and you can see that they the the first two topics in coming to the health I serious topics don't address that will make sure everything's in order but then the perk up when we talk about okay where are you going next we're going to see her grandkids here in Minnesota we are going out to South Dakota we're on ... or\nParis or ah Normandy or a Indonesia or anywhere but it just ... it's relaxing it keeps your mind sharp and you'd even mentioned that you talk about the different people that you meet along the way up both on on the ship\nAnd and wherever you're going and it's just um I I don't know to me it's just awesome and I you know and I was younger I couldn't afford to do these kinds of things and so to be able to do it\nNow most younger people can't with family layers and and even if you can't afford it's tough to get away and\nWell in advance for me it's something like I Would never take a loan out to take a vacation I'd just as if I Can't pay cash we're not going and\nUh but but you know even take my grandkids on trips and I don't know if there's going to be anything left for them when I retire\nOr I mean when I pass away but um my granddaughter said to me she says now you're all about the experience and feels like seven\nAnd I thought that was really you know insightful for seven you're able to say that but that's incredible but I enjoy taking them on trips to and just sharing that experience with them rather than you know maybe leave my pile of money\nI can do some things with them and have some fun and ...\nHave you can do both Carol I that's what I'm hoping for\nAnd they dress and that's what we do we do plan for that for our clients you know if he say\nYou know you need has an example the ten thousand dollars a month but if you had eleven thousand dollars a month to get a twelve thousand a really nice trip once a year why not that so it's all part of the planning process those are the types of things that you can then if it's part of your\nLife experience as part of the things that that that improve your quality of life you should probably important and then you can walk away from work knowing that this is planned for\nAnd and here we're talking about travel just for somebody else Carol love to travel you know do I do ... I don't know if anybody that really doesn't like to know what are some that but for some it it might be something different their retirement maybe it's time travel maybe something else that they'd been longing for years to\nDo and we've got some plants that don't travel but they they're active they the bike they hiked they walk\nYou know things like that around the rest of your everyday he went fishing those are the types of things it's just a planning retirement or whether it has a hiking or doing things around here or if it's traveling it's that you plan for something in retirement so that you have something to look forward to and the trouble is a big part of it expands your mind for a lot of different reasons\nSocially ... recap the segment kind of a pet into our last break here going back to your your recent trip I see setting on Facebook I'm In the hotel there is a typhoon coming we're off the shuttle\nWhile that cat was you know he's got to be kind of wild it was\nCrazy and we ... see a few days before that and that ship was like being on a surf board it was all over the place and then we get in\nAnd you know they're telling us well there's a typhoon coming and I I really didn't know what to expect but I Do have to say in Tokyo it wasn't as bad as like ... where I was really some devastation there I mean we\nI think I woke up about two in the morning and some trees were bending and my husband said later on it was even worse than we saw a few down trees sure but the next day it's like business\nAs usual wow [noise] to me the welcome home Carole thank you glad you man it\nWas a great segment travel I mean and it ties into retirement ties into the sexy segment Jeff\nWe've got another segment coming that's right don't go anywhere Geoff what's your phone number you mentioned to a caller earlier ... two six to five to two forty forty to sixty five to two forty forty eight seven seven five six zero forty forty or if you want to request an appointment or\nGo on line the Cold War way dot com K.

a couple of minutes left\n[noise] um I Would ask you want to think of particular you're thinking about that a a Social Security dot Gov versus Social Security dot com what's gonna happen if you hit ...\nYou will get somebody else's website and there's no guarantee you to to to help you get social well you know we that's an interesting thing because we did get phone calls one time where these people were saying I went on and I looked at disability information and the next thing I Know I've\nGot attorneys calling me and what I what are you guys doing well they were on like a dot com or dot something else\nAnd you know that's kind of what's going to happen the other thing is is you can't guarantee the information\nThat I just like yeah you're just logged on and it's not like your site yeah yeah not secure which is my first red flag soul Social Security ... good\nAnd you know I always harp on this but go on and open up on my Social Security account because you know the the guy that called that was saying he was going to retire at sixty and you know what what is done if it's being things like that\nI think you can plan better go to Social Security dot Gov and check out the website I was looking after retirement page last night and it's constantly updated\nIts you know there's a button you can hit on the tap and if your main languages Spanish or German or something else or you speak of that better read it better you can flip that whole Web page into that language could have you got someone on there in the you know so\nBut go on there and read up you know the lady that talked to about the taxes and not knowing you had to pay that those are the kind of things I mean I think we're all responsible to educate ourselves or have somebody like Jeff staff help you\nGet a good point Yeah Yup Carole thank you very much for coming today and what you said that would lead into exactly our entire team from top to bottom we all talk about retirement planning there are some other firms that ever retirement specialist I have one guy does that or do everything else this is what we do\nAnd that pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds\nThat something crazy was going on but there is no message attached to it it's just being balloons that means mass hysteria would break out so they cancel that program because it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of Nixon there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system that did device and what this was it something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody'd be watching the same program informing you of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their ...\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to buzz your phone whenever he wants to just to clarify if not the president's sitting in his office and saying\nI'm gonna send out this alert no ... there's a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's going to be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how they use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so I didn't come out I was asking forgot about that there was a long strange history of emergency alerts thanks Brenda thank you I was going to [laughter]\nYou're listening to the daily died weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we'll be right back with

takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story he won the lottery hit it big one Ninety million dollars\nAnd then blew through all of it he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nI'm a Santa Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was this the tea crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him the P. T. crews are bad and it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the bags to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking her who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim Hayes\nKim have was charity guard who back in the late nineties one Ninety million dollar and the California state lottery and then over the course of the next decade sort of amazingly I managed to\nLose it all and then after losing it all came\nFestival bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before him and then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking with Hanna ... now and writing letters so it kinda ended telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had to get her poor lawyer then told me you know\nShe can they be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story\nSo why don't you send him a letter in prison and he was up for it he had already pled guilty and he was waiting for\nSentencing hearing acquainted eye contact with him so who basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been that test and K O thing and the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nHey I Am fascinated by what I've read about you know I Want to know more can we talk can we can we had to be pen pals and he wrote in bed and then I send them all that stuff like five or six questions up and get back and he brought me back\nTo the play really amazingly like up the letter with\nLike a really good sense of humor and like a lot a lot of exclamation points if not what I expected at all like in terms of tone\nSo I was like oh man now even more fascinated by it because they don't seem to be found out about the fact that now you're doing great Yoel here in federal prison we're kind of had this happy go lucky even now kind of attitude which\nAfter everything you've been through ... well let's start with some of the good stuff and so he won Nineteen million dollars in the lottery I was actually Thirteen point seven million wants taxes were taken out a climate of its own so you got a shortage above five million dollars out of that he was getting twenty annual payments of about six hundred eighty four thousand\nOh there's every year what did he spend money on what was that life like after he hit it big\nAt first it was shut super extravagant he bought I think a total of at least that meant ... exotic sports cars they had\nHarare landlord and to me that when we were like a Barry into cars and so just dumped a ton of money into that\nI think it was ... might have been his first wife who said that all that money changed him and he had this hot seat touched\nThe attitude after he was alone yeah\nThat was his long term girlfriend she saw haven't changed she met him I think when they went in and they and together for Fifteen Years and so she hadn't changed towards the end of their relationship\nHe was a partying with actors he had a personal photographer at some point which I thought it was pretty interesting\nYou said he race lamborghini's with Mario Draghi and everything whatever you're going to do to live life to the fullest speech run houses actress girlfriends that whole thing is what he was all doing so\nAnd that's what happened to it later on the article someone was saying that is what happens to these people they hit it big there is thrust into like another subset of social life now and they're not ready for it and they don't know how to really\nInteract in that when they come up with so much money\nIs actually yeah and the way that his second wife explained it to me with\nThat look you know he's the guy from kind of a middle class upbringing he was working in the security failed he may have known sort of concept of wealth management\nOr like the smart thing you can do and ... and didn't really care like he just kind of high off the adrenaline and the money that all the data and a lot of bad decisions with his money and he'll tell you that too it was just not really kind of living in the moment and not really thinking\nAbout the future and not a bad thing and just a lot of it in the first years\nAnother a funny little tidbit was his first wife was named his second wife\nAlso name Stephanie so much has something to be had there but the weird\nBut let's talk about where things started to go bad for him\nHe had a previous injury work related injury and he suffered from three herniated discs and then as a lot of people in this country goes through I mean there's a huge opioid epidemic right now\nShe got stuck on painkillers he was prescribed by could in Moscow actually continent and she got hooked and after that a lot of the money you know he's living life large\nAnd then a lot of the money was also being spent on these painkillers\nThat if a big part of it and that but just backing up for a second I think when things really kind of started to go south in terms of money it was a decorated from his first wife she got half of all of those six hundred eighty thousand dollar paycheck so immediately it's not that much\nHere and a half I think she was getting like three hundred grand a year from that\nThat ballpark and then and then that for income tax it sounds like a ton of money and it really is a lot of money to pay ... a ton of it gets taken away and then you think about how much ... it's not as crazy amount of money as you would think but [noise]\nI Will watch their side funny like a myth that we are all that now rules that like what I'm clean and sober now and yeah I Know like for data for\nThe better he even said himself that it helped him more so than the money ever did and that's why I mean I Love these stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest highest to being so desperate that you have to turn to bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it Natalie O'Neill contributor for the Daily Beast and freelance journalist thank you for joining us\n[noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media and the guy pot on Twitter and daily podcast on faith\nLeave us a comment if it's a rating and tell us a story that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts\nI'm Oscar mirrors and this is the daily died we can do this [noise]\nThis is ... from Jay in case of ... solutions let them protect what's valuable\nTo you this is the daily dives weekend edition\nI'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week\nI don't have to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] Nobel\nPrizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and test Sudoku hung Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs him you know therapy it's quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who were these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ...\nBoth of them have specialized in immunology studying the body's immune system this turned out to be a critical\nPart of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective and are effective in certain situations but\nThey can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells ... along with cancer cells so that ... that causes all sorts of complications going\nBack about Fifteen Twenty years there was another ... advance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in cancer cells now this immune based approach that sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to ... the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells it's T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nWhat's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune system has sort of its own natural check points or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack that healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figure it out how to explain that and so they in some way they sort of latch\nOn to the break about his immune system\nIn a way that helps him escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off all the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he is key true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of that all through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to and yes the TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of ... and ... true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drugs has shown some problem is\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it\nThere's also a cost things some of these immunotherapy can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so that has to be figured out as well but Dr ... himself as even said this is a work in progress\nBut he you know confident in his own work in progress of these treatments says by the end of the century cures could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this F.\nThis studies have shown that as welcoming as these drugs are and as much as they represent an advance struggle alone I think for the most part only works in a minority of\nPatients that we see that in the study what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients they can have a lasting effect that can help people live in some cases for years to the trick now is to try to better predict in which patients these drug will work and by\nDoing things like Vioxx seeing tumors and then also studying different combinations of the drugs to see if like two or three of them together can do better than one alone and\nAs you mentioned I mean you mentioned the cost that approach is going to compound the cost factor than the sense that you that there are huge drug alone is relatively expensive and so combining them this going to be even more of a financial burden\nThese are effects that we're seeing that from things that they've been doing for eight years beyond that even longer than that that they've been looking into this stuff specifically Dr Alison the American he has a very intimate relationship with cancer of family members had cancer he had a bout with cancer it's been around him for a long time\nHis mother died of a father in law when he was a child and he has these last other relatives and as you mentioned the need to survivor and so I think is the scientific drive I think is what he credits as the man at his main interest in this but he also has said that seeing the older treatments\nThat his relatives have gone through and some of the complications was sort of an added motivation for him to find something that might be better because these drugs in addition\nTo their advocacy in some cases their side effects are as dramatic as chemotherapy for instance let's not across the board that they do have some serious adverse events but I think doctors are trying to learn to anticipate them better than try to mitigate them as much as possible\nPeter Loftis reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me on\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter]\nThere was lots of Nobel Prize is awarded over the week one of them that did not get awarded was a Nobel Prize in literature the academy had its own me to moment because of a French photographer named John Claude Arnold what do we know about why they didn't hand out this award\nWe know that are now has a has been an academy member and he's actually a recipient academy signs and they ended up roping Swedish Crown princess Victoria at an event in two thousand sex\nYou don't rope a famous princess because you're going to get caught it just seems so obvious I don't know what goes through people's heads sometimes he's been accused of sexual harassment or assault\nIn some cases on academy property by about Eighteen women they also said that he leaked the names of at least seven Nobel winners he's denied all of it obviously\nThis is not the first time that it's happened they declined to award the prize at least seven times before that was it was one of your favorite reasons why why they didn't do it ran and what happened\nSo they've decided at some points to not give out the war and seven times like you said in times of war and when yeah academy determines that none of the nominees deserve it and I just love that concept that they've got seven bucks or ... or whatever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "city": "Madison",
