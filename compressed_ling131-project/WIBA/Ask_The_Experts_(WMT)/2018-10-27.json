say it lends itself to a really good series it lends itself to a really good\nCoaching that show in the context of the western division this is a huge game for both teams are northwestern feels really good about itself after a shaky start which they become accustomed to me while the badgers have three straight road games which really determine their faith the sheer\nNorthwestern ah Purdue and Penn State or those three road games and and\nWisconsin needs or if it wants to win the west is is it it it's going to go through here because those back back weekends in happy valley in in West Lafayette

you need to be northwestern on on its home field and you need to uh play better off it's really the ... the Wisconsin has the blade\nI Know you feel like the the real pressure if it is such a thing pressure the the point of reference to they should be how Wisconsin's off that's a controls the game if it can in fact control the game\nTo me uh it's but that's been the case for a number of weeks in

he's ... he's gonna try and take advantage of a very young secondary\nAnd the the best thing you can do is keep him on the sidelines has to do that is to control a football and and make plays and and that often it's got to do that\nIf Wisconsin is really good to have a ... or above average chance wouldn't be the north west or\nWould imply to run the ball and Wisconsin has some balance with its

on the secondary that's a big part of the storyline but considering that\nThe two inside linebackers step into fixtures right at Edwards and calmly everything around them has been chaotic because of

about a broad based program and we're about trying to have success and everything we do and have nine or have nine teams nationally ranked all at one time it is a really impressive\nAnd you're talking about our good women's swimming program or a member of cross country many women's hockey and then obviously um football and uh volleyball and want to talk or right now so\nThe one of those are getting

I think it was friday morning on his radio hit that um they knew as of Monday that Alex would be questionable [noise] um so they decided okay we've got to get jak ready and I talked to jak\nMight've been week three about the red shirt rule when it was clear that that's what they're planning and even even the whole wouldn't talk about it\nAnd Jack was like look when the red shirt rule first came up I thought hey that might be perfect for me and I'll tell you this right now is if Wisconsin wins today ... and Jack played solidly you know they run the ball effectively I Would expect ... to play next week you would be starting next week against Rutgers and they're still going to say you know we'd like to Richard jak home I don't think that one game is going to change their overall plan\nAbout this matchup in particular Clinton sourcing as one of the wild cards and then she's been a very good quarterback he's got a ton of experience northwestern throws the ball much better than they run the ball what's the biggest challenge facing Wisconsin Steve ...\nWell you know I talked to the Wisconsin defenders about the disparity in in northwestern drawn versus mom off past proficiency because he throws it almost forty two times a game they can't run the ball is this year they won't hit the mark twice once against Rutgers last week but the Wisconsin Center said look they're not going to just abandon the run against us we're going to have a game plan and against the run game\nNow they have they've had problems with you know read options this year but ... doesn't really run it this year as much in the past probably because of the knee injuries coming off so\nIf a scotch and make them throw it all the time they should be able to make him make some mistakes except they're gonna be banged up in a secondary without around here [noise]\nHow much difference does it make or with a ... injury as well on that the anchoring defensive line that has been banged up on outside of sun to pull all year and now he's banked up well\nLook at it this way I'm sure he's going to try to give them something okay the question is how much can withstand I'm guessing you're going to see Ninety percent to four or five scheme from Wisconsin based on the the type of office northwestern runs\nAnd we're talking about ... and ... Williams is this when ... was a freshman he wasn't ready for fulltime duty pricing Williams was not ready for fulltime duty either so I'm sure they're gonna try to get as much as they can out of a levy rotate guys in that two four or five look and do the best they can\nFinally then what do you view is the key or or maybe two keys that you're watching for this one today\nUm to me for Wisconsin dolphins it's no different even though it was a quarterback jobs if they run the ball effectively their quarterback will be in a position where they control playoffs\nPasses and throw when they want to [noise] um I'm really curious to see how ... how many players northwestern decided early in the game to devote toward the line of scrimmage and then\nWisconsin secondary has to hold up against ...

then the badgers found a way Alex ... broke with that pledge drive and and just a a clutch effort all the way around and up at Penn State team\nIt'll be interesting you know they they had to fight for it at Indiana last week and and they were able to win it but it's been a bit of a disappointment I Would think for for the airlines a couple of whole field losses but still dangerous and and it's a big opportunity for both but mostly for Iowa here to stay in the thick of it\nIn the west um play well we saw first hand out good Iowa can be nothing terribly fancy but there's just a good self esteem but a huge huge test for the badger perspective my you got to hope that I can beat them up a little bit is still a couple of weeks away from the game but a\nA string this road schedule for the badgers is daunting to say the least\nOne other Big Ten thought from last night the PJ flack in Minnesota got both orange and the water for a while had a big lead let it get away and then we're able to find a

call the number one wraps\nAnd it's something that you always like to do with backups is give them a certain amount of reps but obviously this week was a little different story I think the one thing with\nWith cone there's a lot about him that none of us will know is is this first college start when he came in last year in six games ... experience is great but\nThe outcome was not in the balance but the one thing that a ... you probably all find with Cohn is that there is some more mobility there in a way they're going to ask him to run a ton but he can extend plays a little bit\nAnd I did the message to him and his use your weapons you've got really you've got a premier tail back to other really good tail bags good fallback\nYou got a lot of guys you can distribute the ball to via the past so you don't have to be super man just be a steady distributor and that was that all that Mike that could hurt the Wisconsin runs the Baltimore\nAnd that that's the point to play book called
