night Supreme Court justice\nAnd they were placed Ginsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme\nCourt nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left\nBy make up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father is CIA true your grandfather was

they got the house back\nSo why she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge the judge and incredible power over future of her family's life and even though eventually they can't lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of root\nFor them it doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is going to be Supreme Court nominee\nThere's a thousand things you could say the CIA one is amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or debt CIA at our grandfather CIA at her brother is with a company that's when the law firm founded fusion GPS on all things considered\nAnd other deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way

they can't believe that there's some was crucified like this I Believe America's on Brecht capital's side and I believe any poll you see that says ... says otherwise is another democratic ... job

Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump bliss until November a twenty seven dean more than one year after the election his name was known in the list for her to react to December twenty sixteen but the media doesn't boy band out either\nYeah lives in the best case I think that uh\n\nDiscover Wisconsin radio has brought you by the Wisconsin counties association working for you\n[noise] within your community there are people willing to risk their safety to ensure yours should emergency strike\nWisconsin county law enforcement has your back to county sheriff's department works to preserve the peace and make you and your families feel safe in your community\nIn in the case of an emergency there'll be with you every step of the way and the nine one one call to well trained a local responders and law enforcement\nSafety services provided by Wisconsin counties hopefully they'll look education and training programs on emergency response so that everyone can be prepared enable back safely in a nursing situation so when it comes to feeling secure [noise] rest assured that you're Wisconsin counties working protect you and your family\nPeople watchful eye on the community that keep homes and businesses save\nThis message is brought to you by the Wisconsin counties association\nLearn more at W.

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and uh after a doctor forwarded testified the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the is sold in the impact it at our life and not have your ... this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon\nJudge ... generally I'll respect said I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove the great political theorist said forward as\nA credible unbelievable\nSo when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the feeling is the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flip completely but but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have a Christine forward straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman wants a anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I Try to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so one conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't and we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we have to Colorado yeah completely lost our way because he went on telling us that Donald Trump ever had a chance of winning\nOr the people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to the testimony that the women and men I found Brett cabinets people even though there was such a notion from falsely accused in\nA man who end up in the court of public opinion in the current day leading up to this quote unquote hearing a life with completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats\nAnd that his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I can't believe that something happened to her she obviously has been in therapy for H.\nI. she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that she got doorbell no there's no snow so obviously she had an issue now\nJust because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that just because she says Brett Kavanaugh right there it maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start being additives\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nNow all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the presidency and twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court one of his name wasn't on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned critical Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching\nAnd hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case [laughter] however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing all this talk about equal rights and gender equality what are you know what I was treated not as a woman that as a man as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily Hong Kong and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly eyes and then we find out she was all over the world and also just the whole in our story said thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison",
