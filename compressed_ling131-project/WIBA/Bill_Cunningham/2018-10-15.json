looked like a liberal Democrat\nWhat you're doing is that is fabulous away exchange somewhere nicer these small talk and said you ready for it I said let's go\nI handed him a Mike and I took a Mike and I talked to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about the

thank you very much so we're going to play that interview and about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on and we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me\nHit 'em on two or three months ago about how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women\nThey vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially for American women some as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN honored Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West but courage sellers\nIs a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro\nOf the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Tanya the racial draft they had it with him hey she's spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat cities local Tom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jessie Molly Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party\nWhen the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro or you sell the ratio\nJordan's against them they would it be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history which CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and\nThe pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly punished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south had their control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause his ... media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control way of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter\nOf black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party and he's gonna try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas\nTo Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese are rise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN debate employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West\nAnd and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party\nHas done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black families completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support\nFor a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime\nAnd poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic party's treated blocks the relevant question isn't y con you realize that but why others have not realized why even more black voters at the same epiphany as Kanye West why has it had happened yet well maybe it is\n[laughter] always listening to morning honey can often guess who turned around and you can't always listening car\nArm around now listening on your terms it's never been

hear from President Trump is not as the\nMedia uses cut Joel's in weapons\nTo hit politically Trump every chance they get and once they wear out that person you don't hear from 'em anymore right now it is ... shows you a good show ... who's the Saudi Arabians citizen\nWho was in Turkey in order to get like a permission to marry some uh some Turkish woman he goes to the Saudi Arabian embassy in could show gate has not been seen since October the second now this happen in Turkey is down both turkey it appears probable\nA Saudi Arabian citizen was killed in Istanbul, Turkey somehow Trump was responsible for this\nThey want the president to respond to see the media use Julie sweating it for awhile dispose of her when the allegations of gang rape\nAnd Michael ... whose father with Michael ... is doing a great job speaking for the Democratic party it'd be wonderful that guy would stay in the media for the next couple of years it'd be great if he was the nominee of the Democratic party the porn lawyer fits the modern Democratic Party has done a great job you take Julie sweating ache\nFor Deborah Ramirez or Christine forward haven't heard from them in a while I have you because the media is done using them to attack Trump or Stormy Daniels what's the last time you heard from her\nOr Karen McDougal in love with the president for ten years ago Access Hollywood tape of Billy Bush the comments on John McCain the Khan family Kanye West ... whatever it is right now it's all about ... some al\nMedia want you to think the president's not responding correctly so the murder maybe I'm a Saudi Arabian and his damn bowl\nAs if to six or seven hundred blacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's big north or the four thousand shot they can't be used\nIn Chicago to attack the president so they ignore it but whatever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president whether they're going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next to this is my interview with the president then at the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so we\nHave diamond in suburban are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line much like a southern slave

city has to talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is and he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we

a\nBill she really had a big impact on me\nAnd the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and an South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous as much a a much improved

it's just ridiculous how the media covers that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall\nWith all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped me the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction\nWe're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by governor or a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative what CBS would say from top to bottom or going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values\nAnd cover the news objectively I think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and then ABC NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox ... leaning left quite often Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC those ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you gotta do is look at

Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nYou're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on\nIt's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country to the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years I mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "15"}
