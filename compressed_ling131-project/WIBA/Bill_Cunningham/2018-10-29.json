{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "And uh she's in the fight for her life the twenty second congressional district in New York a toss up\nMillions of dollars being spent up in and around the entire region a which is northern north of New York city in and around the Syracuse area and she joins us now uh Syracuse dot com poll well it's a one point raised Claudia it can't get any closer\nAnd uh it's typical of a lot of races that are going around around the country he pulled us out\nYeah it's ... it's not the race just for my life it's for the people that live here it's for protecting the tax cuts the one time we finally got a real tax cut direct\nMoney into the pockets of the people that live here instead of all the high taxes spend that we've received from Albany under Governor Cuomo I'm the progress socialist and ... and New York city that basically run\nOur our state and my opponent is one of them he\nActually had a lower conservative rating than some of the most socialist\nLeft leaning Democrats and the New York state assembly and he's trying to cast himself as a Republican or a moderate in his district he's breathed wants the word Democrat\nHe's trying to deceive in condom voters here\nAnd just say okay I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when he gets he talks to Cuomo silver whomever telling them what to do and he's one of the twenty four Democrats\nAcross this country who is trying to deceive the voters by saying oh no I won't vote for Nancy Pelosi meanwhile he's taking a ... nation fourteen thousand directly from her count\nHer dark money superPAC\nSpending billions of dollars trying to get to George Soros icon dire who wants to impeach president\nO'Donnell just at a fundraiser for I'm In New York city Governor Cuomo Alec Baldwin all these Hollywood left is we're all in just trying to attack the president and try to hurt the upper a region of New York where are our middle class taxpayers are finally take a break free policies from the president\nBut never things to the governor of New York I'll say that and you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job of according to the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen I think it was eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become under Cuomo and\nYou know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up tracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area we don't do it\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton grim county which is on the border of Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where I was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in Albany that have just strangled our economy we're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner and this district our family because it's which started in Nineteen forty six\nOn I've been around the districts I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet one that hasn't I praised for tax reform and\nThey're saying we're actually based tax cuts are were reinvest thing\nEvery one of them it's giving a rage to their employees or opponents or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we roll back on necessary regulation\nOr we could really open up the southern shared a responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts you against it and this is how scary my upon it as we get a debate last night he ever voted ... times\nFor government takeover of our health care which is a single payer which would cost the taxpayers nprcrowdsource bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's just sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion and your taxes on an annual basis\nBe cool [laughter]\nThat's a good idea to believe what Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway\nA ... incredibly are many he's gotten a dollar\n... this is a solution not\nVoted four times for ... term abortion this isn't a moderate you're this isn't a radical you this is the guy who is trying to pretend that support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus he's going to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown getting hurt the tax on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job you get any assembly now we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny not her van of come to the district to help him get elected but you know became dark district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWhere you also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunker up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on\nThis and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican and you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district\nSo you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raised some incredible amounts of money have been talking to my colleagues are across the country the amount of money they're jumping introduced racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous I mean my opponent star outspending me I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives that New York\nUh when I served in the assembly on still you know one of the conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to read these elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gain even an upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping or small business community are small business humidity\nIs it Ninety eight percent of my my the businesses in my region and they create most of the jobs that's his name out just live by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest are the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we brought it to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo\nIs suing the federal government over the tax cuts it because his wealthy donors\nWant to leave New York because they're not getting a lifeline that they used to get\nThere actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight it says this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have money to deceive voters and full that meant to think even if this guy is somehow a moderate I and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote at its most important we can beat the wall money but we need our Republican voters to understanding each pick it up a really really poor\nAlright uh Claudia Tenney a running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com\nAs the main you know ground zero seats that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll my son and your back to Congress\nAnd eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves it we don't have many good New York politicians at all um by the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify least\nSome forensic evidence including fingerprints which which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here uh let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny as in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been any political sense whatsoever but these mid terms are um believe me in court\nTo get out and vote [noise] uh and you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watching it or not but I Am and\nListen I Hope everyone feels the same way you do is four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home it's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really that that simple and we'll get the government we deserve I've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media\nYou know I see three scenarios that could unfold\nBut I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and\nMaybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives is well within our power to win if people identify the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve you know I've had many ups and downs following political ...\nDigital ... around the world that are ... could have been ... been when he was on hand like they have received and so on and off\nThe agenda on their side I'm prepared for what didn't have any answers\nArrived at this thing to get out and save the rotten yet no good life for Robert Ballard says absentee ballot there\nIf you can get back to how vote I'll be there and ... got to lose races only able to live in\nA robbery our um is now up and up I was in charge ... deal with all the other ones voters to deal with him last night way what a blood out on an orange and more friends alive now be ... or ... thoughts wide Jewish talking to rebuild Iraq got a lot of people and so I look\nAbout what happened in the hate this guy exhibited\nMany many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with [noise] what the un\nFriend that was I knew or knew what are you oh you were saying things humid day from your home purchases and by the way to the new way to pretend hated Donald Trump because Trump was\nA great ... of Israel first when our results in a way to draw because Trump the only American resident ... show raps his daughter a bomb go ahead\nCall us today as becoming an observant to your mortgage giant Jared ... a a sculptor clockwork orange juice the older like it's not president elect number children or Jews or which is the president has a chance\nSpending Julie not religious functions is I ... and so this guy who can certainly a hate Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill are no criminal passionately\nAs his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly we purchased royalty on one after Trump racing for loving Jews because they randomly and is now the Trump is being attacked from the mainstream media Washington Post called ... code things directly or indirectly securities\nThe murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo or one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream\nObjective news sources which of course they're not sleep\nIn fact on the day that CNN received the photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe immediate reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor\nShe Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death in fact after James Hodgkinson\nAttempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio\nEven though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol tape the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks\nMuch like the er the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like ... defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children\nOf a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of al annoy they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants and also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner on a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist permanent ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people applied\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite sat on a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd ... that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgusts me\nI Hope soon very soon but a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it tempered thing ... McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David re a fair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public\nHealth crisis caused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding in the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough aids ... diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that\n\n\nWhen we help accident victims we fight to get them full justice nothing what\nThat means all of the law says your injuries costs medical bills lost wages and compensation for all your pain and suffering ... now and in the future\nAt Clifford and dry hole law we rely on thorough analysis detailed preparation and a strong compassion for our clients to help you achieve your maximum recovery\nOver decades of helping accident victims we built a track record of success that you can trust when you choose Clifford ... will fight to make those responsible for your injuries pay you nothing less than the full compensation you deserve to make things right\nRelentless dedication to helping you and your family she has Clifford ... hard working skilled attorneys fighting for you for just test my justice dot com [noise]\nCooper take the money and ride promotion is feeding off now through October thirty first claim a coup retires ... virtual would counter cars worse off one hundred dollars when you buy a new show to force qualifying retires at Broadway crime in auto went on a Pennsylvania for sun prairie\nChoose from great options like long lasting CSI brand touring Europe will discover eighty three runway car rental\nCars in auto repair gun we care [noise]\nSure innovations presents\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoins ... renovations for cocktails and ...\nMy name is Khan wrenching I Do imaging and from addicts and cyber security and I tell everybody on the University of Maryland university\nStill putting off a building that dream\nGraduate professors that you um UC are very knowledgeable they work in the industry because I got a degree from your immunization\nWas just in Baltimore's champions you're seeding is limited reserve yours today on secure innovations Facebook page\nSee I got promotions that helped me move up in the world and earn more for my family\nOr in your degree on line from her\nMostly not temper twenty prefer that one of my time I can only\nSeven seven seven does that hard to find nothing hours animal [noise] he's a Muslim e muscles and checking your website for Apple's like time\nDuring early told him from ... percent of all from occurring harmful for\nPossible introducing new Medicaid planes in Virginia in helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's still family cared dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from optimal health\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's facing your home or after easy in ...

I Hope I'm ... years\nNow\nBook Twitter and Instagram and the only white dichotomy accounting of us continue\nWith the tragedy the tragedies this week and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether that attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that uh this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a heavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff\nJoining me now is that the same Thomas rescue and former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nA very tough situation awful um well when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I submitted ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel\nDidn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that the Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nIt today did ugly reporting\nSaying that uh that are in fact Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago just said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post were not exploit\nTo attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such an on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective\n... said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather ratio anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI it not as of yet one I've seen\nIs you know hindsight is always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was honoring his\nTweets his social media is other things that he was posting couldn't have alerted only went one way you know when you say is if you see something say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had this scene\nAnd could've alerted the police on the police if we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about ... hours and and do something or in a look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people had caught about an Eighteen year old punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo perfection on horse but you're only as good as shift today and wish I could keep on force is very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on it so [laughter] I Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always did\nA review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing what the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em then looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered\nScrew the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours waiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates the highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews and against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nAnd as you said his grandchildren or Jewish so you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what is said it's a matter of how we're saying it doesn't matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments\nAnd agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on me [laughter] a bunch of years ago and thank God he failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night worrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to someone the guy who was\nSort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns and go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas Rosekind former NPT NYPD officer thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit because there is nuts everywhere Thomas thank you very

with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and\nThen the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now yeah well in New Mexico what the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organize stunt by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator than the activist who got this together explained that that the major media will deal with\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand disenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill\nA Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population is a way to destabilize\nAnd disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress a who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing ten ... suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me\nDon't you take your wife and kids and try walking to Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states in let's let's be honest here is that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days\nAway probably the most important mid term election and your and my life time though I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the wind and the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with ... began marching together along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intends motor and care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh caravans that have\nFormed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual\nAnd I've seen pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying\nTo uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilize South Florida but it ended up leading probably two or\nJimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "show_name": "Bill
