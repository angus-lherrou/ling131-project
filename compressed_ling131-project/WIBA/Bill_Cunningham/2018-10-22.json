after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly ... block them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nHas made it and run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do\nAnd the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop the let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans suddenly like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals door presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico GM other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so\nUh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California Texas New Mexico through legal migration that there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent\nTrees in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy\nNow with Trump is our leader\nEverything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip as an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just a ... they're the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head\nThe terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice and marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nAccording to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through presidencies we've taken legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen this is fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse if in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat the most violent places on earth is sending as largely young males to come into America\nGot a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up then demand rights\n... inside of America much less in other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on a murder in Turkey\nBecause if it's a journalist excuse me ... show was not a journalist who was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but even if he was quote a journalist does that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to\nSomeone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I I'm\nWaiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any there you know who they are\nTo me the ... narrative as a hustle it's fake news it's a ploy\nUsed to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize is death as a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nI guarantee you he his life as no more value than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses lie for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time in American elsewhere so why is the death\nOf a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news because the media\nWants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lights up meeting the CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist some alley indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show geek in Turkey who believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue on\nThe line becomes available it never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing\nIs tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivized by the mainstream media and the fact that Jamal could show gate if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is deaths that was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there seven hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind thing give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't because it made it uncovered you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us than a brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nThey want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea they must have nothing else to talk about [noise]\nMost concerned when we do is go right to the [noise]\nOne becomes available you know the routine built hunting and the great American [noise]\nLive with you every Sunday [noise]\n[noise]\n\nReally coming up we'll go to your calls now coming up later on ours does point Lewandowski [noise] and after\nThat will be a Kevin jak center the blacks fear about the impact on legal immigration the black community and why he was elected do by Fox News for making alleged in temperate comments about some of the women\nWho accused Brett Kavanaugh of a bad behavior then I think it was a lie at a maximum misstatement or the other side but nonetheless that's continuing their calls let's go to a fill in Connecticut an ad in Las Vegas and filling Connecticut Welcome to the bill Cunningham show and Phil how are you\nMr Cunningham how are you Mr film I'm doing well please go ahead\nWell here's the thing\nIt Connecticut boom and he's been off require ... hearing granted\nI Know for a fact he's working on this caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border in a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of why should you know by the time string them [laughter]\nAnd truckers already said he's not used in the reserves in front of your real army and I think the planners they weren't really like another ... came to America [laughter] or from the border\nI immigrants are being oh don't worry [laughter] orbits like stormed the Mexican border a few days ago mecca would you put in a token effort to hold them better twenty four hour ensure [laughter] whoa us and sharing with Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico I read all these people on our border\nTroops are going to be there they got to be stormed the truth [laughter]\nI think there's got to be a part of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're\nOh it's good to meet you here to mediate here this is all court\nOffend them and that's why you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero\nA state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty I does this play well with residents Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio we don't\nOne ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together his legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals come and go ... most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant there's tens of thousands or the mayor thanks that Governor Malloy ... over the past year and a half the Blumenthal every time these legal immigrants ISIS above the court room they hold up her shirt\nThick Blumenthal shows up the true for other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually the\nIce a suspense their case you don't hurt future here because part of the TV cameras all all the\nTime trying to keep the eagle illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and getting caught you send back immediately\nBecause of the law if you're from Central America and you said the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing\nYou get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing then you released back into America and the most you can be held is fourteen days there's not we're not scaled to handle this invasion but most violent places on earth Central America we're not able to do it\nContinuing ed and know Los Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current uh conned boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also how Obama drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill and blow 'em up you know ...\nAnd then the media doesn't need no doubt that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know ... ... ... it's in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of wacky being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone on top of that are killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior not part of the world\nIs regular that's where it goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist and then I hear about ... ... is the Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do\nAnd why why does like more valuable than a ... life\nMPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same way up look at the head of the past ... who's backed us they understood oil as political up on a boat Porsche and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed a bass their supply Afghanistan\nPlus there and says African Business conference that Obama held\nFor fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and and the are they just fall under over how the credo bomber was reaching out to Africa\nNot looking at the human rights background\nOf this desk fought for tourists African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you want to quickly but use Pakistan had a leader who would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing footing around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right to boil alive your political opponents that's okay\nThe seven than you will fall flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals and lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock

W why BA\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill cutting Hampshire Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that\nThere is a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump\nAnd a truly cares about other people he's extremely uh magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is\nHe's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong ... Research Center bows out a bread proves out one of my buddies\nDid every few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection and the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good\nA lot of bad stuff what is the media only report the bad enough to good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time\nIn our nation's history conflated those to see Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump didn't interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana framed in his mobs versus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at bread Kevin Oh\nLook about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with pen\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that that that moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with senator\nTed Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want\nThis president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this I hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally and his acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... it would be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no\nIt was appropriate because she was an adult he was president of the United states\nLeader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton was still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse of Donald Trump had done that with\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will

for life I bet you we find out\nThat you know there's a history of her\nThat nobody wants to discuss and that's why she's linked the way it ... you know when once it was done oh no I'm not going to

Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what the bloody limp told her roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place\nAnd then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the Juanita abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House says president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House and that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger doubled than it has to do more with men\nVisits me too

Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ... on the\nCouch and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up\nBeing a bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies [noise] this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like cabin all they want to make him the poster child\nI mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms of physicians would somebody\nA Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama selected Harvey Weinstein\nTo to take their

access Harvey Weinstein was uh making millions of dollars in giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas\nSo they sent their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nThey didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nConfirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulation\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on cruel other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that we could do\nAn important factor in the fact that ... trillion dollars this more than the government actually tax uh either from businesses are on the individual each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under ...\nIt's all of these rules are made and very frequently a rules are they are laws that were ... years ago I'm kind of generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authorities if she were all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute\nYou're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make this rule and there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nIt the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called conditional forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually be getting to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "22"}
