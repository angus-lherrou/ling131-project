come out now\nAnd the newsmakers Madison and in the morning\nAfter five [noise] and don't you know when you want to be\n[noise]\nRight if we can then you were in the war in the ...\nAnd ... with us as well I don't understand there's a well I Know there are consequences ... because\nI Know Richard ... lawyer at the time of really good guy by the name of Lin wood uh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through every one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence\nAnd they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes I guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe for the same reason we use the public figure\nUh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job winning out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs in high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out their wealth discussed\nA and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nTime of the road I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney at and pay taxes in ten years\nAnd then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's ... no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given\nPossibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where is just snowflake gonna vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to the three any Mitch McConnell had been a real war here and pushing for actual churning graphically not on the Internet and I think that in the crap\nYou're exactly right it can make it through a week ago we would have had like ... or ... or China I think he's here that we might not air link and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nThat'd be ... they have clinical calculation didn't mind you had Joe Manchin looking at it gate or\nThirty percent margin that people want to see an confirmed by three margin that people have North Dakota once the cat and knock at first it would be political suicide\nOr high camp or match in Oregon cannot vote for that nominee don't get people to get their humor lapdog but they might get out of their own political okay who factory right\nI mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go\nAnd I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana\nThe jury because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it ... the man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's the conscience of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion that\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right that if you're the thank you both for being with us he couldn't get his teen votes I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state\nRace it off to the northeast New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says no I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again oh so every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles

Fox News too many people are dead after a limousine crash in ... New York about thirty miles west of Albany the state capital Chris Fiore is with the New York state police\nOf her witnesses either refuted her story I had no memory of the gathering question also the therapist notes never really came out and accepted the Washington Post the Washington Post said that Ford originally claimed there were four boys\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boys she said\nShe said she was in her late teens\nAnd it's just watched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the Nineteen eighties and then she switched back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica she went to Hawaii she went to uh\nThe south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes the boyfriend also said during the\nSix years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned the sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh will shed no fear of flying in fact they flew around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nBut she uh the the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause it came out that they want it to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that\nShe also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today her lawyer Deborah attach came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really\nShe's done with it so\nMedia turn out to be liars and thieves and crooks in miscreants every every description the second accuser Debbie ... a dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported her story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories\nOf ... Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAnesthetic all information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweat Nick nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from Senator Collins on Saturday quote\nSome of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken stayed to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence\nAnd simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times wrote a column a son this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kavanaugh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe the survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and\nIt must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse but also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case in which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty or not\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done\nPlus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these values are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men so when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward\nThey completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are\nSteven Kobe or of the Late Show as a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening aerial do miss aerial do much to say writer on Stephen ... bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote\nAt six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about\nFinding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak by a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that you wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\n... and this writer for the CBS Evening show\nStephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized the vote than we've ever been goes to the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media pedaling in lives in irrelevant sees Senate Democrats demon crashes demon rats as some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper\nAnd Don Lemon every night and put 'em on keep doing he's doing a great job so let's continue with more of your calls at eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later is that same Julie gun lock the independent women's forum\nDoesn't have it at all in fact once the allegation is made that is tantamount to conviction even Michael ... mentioned Julie sweat and they have to take them as completely accurate and having asked for a one week delay\nMen when the FBI supplement it first seven time Mitch report they found that the nine witnesses interviewed by the FBI over the last five or six days and do till Thursday night we're kind of not not enough to add another list the twenty five more and once they were interviewed there'd be forty more and after that for a hundred more it would never stop\n'cause this is all about running out the clock\nTaking control the Senate on November the sex that's what it's all about\nIt's not about fairness or determining whether or not you know Cavanaugh is a Romney slash Bush Republican he's not an Amy Coney Coney Barrett or a judge to par\nI have a sense that Kevin always going to be a conservative\nAbout along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock running over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure\nBut once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated a bone and by the Senate by the mainstream media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore north teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false it's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nThat were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door in our house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that would corroborate her story including our best girlfriend\nNone of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out in an affidavit to the Senate how many times\nThat professor forward lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit this was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message to other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this as a judge the judge hardness or wait for you and so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court\nBut in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said I mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen was container and your calls with calls from Chicago\nIndianapolis New Hampshire Nevada Delaware Wisconsin many other states coming up later in the last hour will be Julie gun lock independent women's forum and also just the leaf Peterson\nLive from Los Angeles in\nThe line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three still counting emigrate America [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAnd I felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them\nTo rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey\nGraham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold bake it in the night she was brilliant\nGoing over for forty five minutes while she was going to support then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a Brett Kavanaugh's wife his mom and dad has girls\nAnd what they had to put up with it like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kind of stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart\nIncluding the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett up in ... the fame to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThank bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party could have pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women\nUh over the years but one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry that I'm just wondering if they're really cared about when the why did they take money from these people who would like women that we\nFound out Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against Trump\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal prosecution against pornography that open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women July for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time\nBut I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turn out to be a lie or misstatement or not true\nYou know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was Kevin all but the but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli you're left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said in twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and changed the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for suddenly it was in her late teens that was Fifteen\nMessage into your ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business

else a little over an hour with Julie gun locks of independent women's forum\nAbout a woman's perspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feelings damp towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feelings damp toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lies and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape\nOr sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be ... merged between the me too movement on one hand and wound up ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault I naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determined to vote she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and says she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door headed nuts\nAnd did it would cost her phobia and the board friend follows the epidemic but saying we've from little planes all over French Polynesia and painting and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie but there was nothing she said ... to turn out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face\nMitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored instead of you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe is mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and and the person with the Y chromosomes that is a lawyer\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the fact that's what caused the writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nBad is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party things today about Brett

they are downright evil they will do nothing to get it our number two that Democrats look socialist progress is incapable of analyzing fact whether it be about climate change whether it be utilized but that Dr forward present it in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that we still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about the second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about her late teens now Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to a college hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political forces the only way that we are going to become and we

Court\nWe never question but let me see if the promise but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the

a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results of the ... elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton in New York Times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a court sailor was going to win\nMeant Trump won and up to this point\nHillary and a major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the

code red about a ... ... voter mission in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bunch of him example in the city of Cleveland\nThere were more votes cast for Obama than citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is to Cunningham if you're a code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the and the companies that are the only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine as program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast the machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the term who's on the ballot what have you know and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would a\nWaiver from the Republican the end of the Democratic\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and
