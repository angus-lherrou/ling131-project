A. dot com [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nThey are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit\nUm if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and fallen off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they know west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about ... want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar\nIs their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal ... when you put in solar wind\nA you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple\nThe cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent\nThere were noble energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nWhich talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution out there\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOr no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up new ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... dot

certain news lemon up your report this week\nWell the uh the world leaders are pretty much signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders of a a signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the nations have signed up to the Paris accords even even though President Trump has said he's going to withdraw\n... a lot of it is kind of a universal thing\nUm but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you are\nA half to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount and a year and\nHas that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment ah they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate was called the University of east East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOh they don't know who were somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker and these emails showed some very bad a behavior uh there were a uh guys that are\nOr were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk hating or data or there were people trying to interview a to influence the peer review process [noise]\n[noise] I'm just I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is my interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with yellow stone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen [noise]\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under their young they call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make it\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John yeah\nAh my dad who ah\nWho quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about wind bills when I when I was living in Oregon\nOkay\nAnd I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was up by twenty four ... booth\nClaim you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas or were you now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Chris city now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost whom I Can't have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills a but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext up let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you are in thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into spoken to him several times that\nHurt him on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think\nWe should warn are good friends she\nNot than they are the same mistake that these climate\nHopes are uh are using a ... I Believe me I Believe you said a one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few\nOf those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject man and a\nA ... a a young child than a here's the point is you've already said\nThat ... one thing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's frosty has told us is this your second shift in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive Billy improve their lives they're doing All right with out as a boss will rich a lot of them are\nAre tending illegally into this country because they had been tricked and seeds into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there because you're having a lot more money in their pocket what's that yeah I didn't\nAlready all music\nDon't miss the iconic performance is ya\nMiss [noise]\nThey didn't win the WNBA\nSoutheastern Wisconsin and we had to chocolate city Burlington to explore that area next\n\nDiscover Wisconsin radio has brought you by the Wisconsin counties association working for you\nWithin your community there are people willing to risk their safety to ensure yours should an emergency\nStrike Wisconsin county law enforcement has your back the county sheriff's department works to preserve the peace and make you and your families feel safe in your community\nAnd in the case of an emergency there'll be with you every step of the way from the nine one one call to well trained a local responders and law enforcement\nSafety services provided by Wisconsin counties also include public education and training programs on emergency response to so that everyone can be prepared enable tax safely in a nursing situation so when it comes to feeling secure [noise] rest assured that you're Wisconsin counties working to protect you and your family\nKeep a watchful eye on the community and keep homes and businesses save your community your county this message is brought to you by the Wisconsin counties association learn more at W.

second to buy your twenty fifty we're going to have global forest ... growth\nA net global forestry growth on the planet force are still shrinking\nBut in two thirds of the world's nations the United states Western Europe Russia China we have forests growth are stable for us so there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited ... forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA uh their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nUh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm\nUh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the ... it used to be a big court or a big port [noise] um in in the northwest\nItaly an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher\nBut again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoost in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt\nClimate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this\nA lot of ... sand what harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this kind of self I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factor why\nYou're not seeing the real no weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago where see an animated cartoon but there is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThat this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex which have in our with our weather ... ones don't hear about it and the new\nLet's Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce or some might have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he ah go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the way that Adam is being gay or engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on a show talking about ... put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body out son where people are so much more hate about the fact that they're doing this\nSo they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off became trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now where you can go to the street and bet\nOn the stock market on the weather if they want or again that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the show on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of the climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they weren't they were doing a stripping the oil industry all nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sits over there with her sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh I Know now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your

break on us\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and think keep to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high treason could see it\nAnd went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the pools\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nComing along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was don't maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving notice fighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd you're like Ninety\nPercent of it is an uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine or the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool the wife is saying the husband was to shovel where's the rate was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hand spades\nSo having accomplish that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife pulled the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants\nAnd\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by\nNow these hands spades withdrawn they actually called the police report depth on the property of tools and this and that\nNumber could understand who would come on their land and the tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods [laughter] they found one of the shovel leaning on a tree and the wife go out nine feet off the ground one of the one\nHand garden trial with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to the house they got a I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't butch this thing it was buried under a tree several inches he couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shovel in the ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\nThe Capitol and look if you have any of the problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives well as I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside\nAnd the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taking the head of lettuce one mashed and whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just kept right over the warrior went and had it's full of feed\nAnd then left they recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nHe actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking now so it's\nIt's been John convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which\nIs

is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they formed this unlikely friendship\nAnd turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big foot ...\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them where they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with [noise]\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought to look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since ... book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a\nAnd yet getting back to what I said earlier\nNone of this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the film is a hoax or the or a a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know a a we'll tune in because we're hearing things that we can\nGet in Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys that were all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them or to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania\nTo do a weekend of survival training or on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area where at night for the I ... well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision\nA by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them there's just no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but\nIt was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nRight so that the parents and the it was that bright yeah\nI mean it it it's a glowing orb of light show darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world [noise]\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird [noise]\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he describes a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through want\nAs a child okay so this thing is coming out of the side of this orb and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nShe uses screams
