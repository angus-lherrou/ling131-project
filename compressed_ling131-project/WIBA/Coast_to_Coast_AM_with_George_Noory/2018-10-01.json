... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though uh appreciate the invite\nYou say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities with some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family are people who have been lost\nWhen you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the\nHigh rollers but people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nBecause it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat have happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that\nThe jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances Jeff lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd a sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course the confessional Park Service they have the largest contingent a federal you train police officers and the national park police [noise]\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for lifting missing people\nMiss [noise]\nKeeping you connected with Dan ... he's a guy image little guy and he was like why not

there that uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] so this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks\nAll frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is that can ... missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know it's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him I'm less effect can't end this thing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right I'm a ... for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that usually ruin on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times other times they want there is a case from eighty six\nSo there's a couple of sites that\nTalk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important [noise]\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track but that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated that\nProbably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida was found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen all these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search thirty miles away\nFor a two year old just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child what's that child's going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nOh yeah and\nWe talked about a two year old boy that they gassed he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was found face down and snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened in his his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nDon't have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance and you do the math on the bill I guess if\nWalked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go what six miles per hour a bunch of kids are going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible unless somebody pick them up or some something or someone picked him up and locked up their\n... and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's adopted in downtown [noise]\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know church often to put them in the car and drove them there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talked to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody ever saw anything nobody Sony cars\nNobody else was there so how did that trial make the difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nReady to take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy I Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David ... we're going to take a break the Ellen persons project break down into the break [noise]\nCoast website is now streamlined from Greek news if your coast insiders simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nOr kids better off in an intact family you bet they are this is Joe Cornell at the domestic litigation from Cornell Cornell kids living in a house so we're married parents do better in school they're emotionally healthier and they're more likely to stay out of trouble with the law\nIf you're in a troubled marriage of course you should do everything you can to save your marriage if only for your kids say this includes considering alternatives to the force of course in some circumstances divorces on avoidable in either case if you're a man facing a crisis in your marriage let us help you at Cornell Cornell remember where the partner men can count on cold\nOr domestic litigation from of course Dylan Cordell to schedule an appointment with one\nOf our firms men as soon attorneys partner men can count on six zero eight two three four four zero for for that six zero eight two three four four zero for four or visit on line at Cordell Cordell dot com Cordell in Cordell beat zero four zero eggs socio Dr sweet for zero three Madison, Wisconsin five three seven one son\n[noise] it's Monday October first what's new today on the free I have a radio a\nShow sorry you're weak with all the best ... gas stations in what happened was rocked up every ... doctors on the radio original vision vinyl experience\n\nNothing to rape me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring the bed of his country back to greatness as\nThat are reflecting the rules a return to listen to Nick and Vicki story about the quiet\nDuring went very loud and ... and Kerry and\nBeing debt free here's nationally syndicated radio host and best selling author Dave Ramsey with today's Ramsey reality check when you're working hard to beat ... and you have a car payment you need to get rid of it if you can't pay it off and Eighteen months she looked at showing the car Charlotte and get rid of the debt take a couple of thousand from the sale and use it to ...

there\nWell there's an ... a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nWell in February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on my case I got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any\nI said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles and all the reports said that they said it she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working in a ... a university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe love the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque [noise] she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site\nWith a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service than sending to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described in reports is cold and blustery they determined care it was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that at the care would never ever go off trail she was in al ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for review what it says one additional clue was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the house a J. O. S.\nA very strong and distinct human odor was found but he knew what their locations supervising ranger how cross of ...\nThrough our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of a body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than a vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never and thousands of reports seen anything described in our national park service report of very weird and scary\nFlight guys that yeah that's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there is no source or the older\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nSo I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be rewritten scary\n[noise]\nBut uh\nAgain this was her second hike into that area was she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty\nDays search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no there's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know\nI'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents\nAnd I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety

going you why be a [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo Dave I Want to jump around a little bit to make sure we save some time to talk about the air cases so I Want to jump into one of the most babbling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McCabe and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nWell on September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and critically\nAt the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nTo twenty three am Henry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voicemail a strange sound screaming paying growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you they goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I\nPut it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that triangle ... national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence [noise] so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into where should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from among the field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a\nGrew up not far from Moffett Field in Sunnyvale I grew up Cupertino and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps\nThat patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise] [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair there was a man by the tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and Ensign Charles McAdams thirty eight years old and\nThey've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed ... report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the pharaoh in Ireland and Cody with the control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands\nIt ate all five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWhat a plane's encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort fund the near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why there [noise]\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and calls Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb sniffing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each\nA airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call for fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately that may be found to fishing boats and\nNavy boat in a postcard ship that saw the blimp dip and drop to wears on the oil slick the blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd is it all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappear\nThe crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crews did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the ... were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and there's the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jump into\nThe other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people into the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nTo find them ... and I just logged on to go to ... am done\nBusiness owners in professional say special challenges in divorce

crew is gone they pick up the story from there [noise] for\nThe navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood massive search off the coast that went on for days\nAnd they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up and at the clouds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch a lick that they were watching on the water\nThere were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because Jeff north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called offering bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area [noise] and nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that has just strangeness attached to it and like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight\nBecause that that area of the water was searched up there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held my teen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of in Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works uh in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them uh their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these uh locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot um cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it any asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I ask a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and\nAlleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to disappear if I could sing my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nRobbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood\nBecause they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water\nAnd I have no cases from there it's bizarre\nAnd isn't\nIsn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's a manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation they use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort of that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people are brown there and uh\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you
