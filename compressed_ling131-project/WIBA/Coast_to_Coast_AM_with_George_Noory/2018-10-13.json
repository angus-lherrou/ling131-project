there's only four figures smaller trying\nNot I think would be Fifteen\nTwenty percent would be my guest George but the important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern extra citizen\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there they generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environment\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed\nBy somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nA that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Anna ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police say Sean priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion I wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is the complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy\nIn our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear it out ones and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies the energy field\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist in every religion and not the only one\nOr they're qualified extra system just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I had deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it it they need help too\nEverybody needs help hold on for more at the uh we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website stark clear dot com his book is called power

once we get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a stand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions and very famous I won't mention the name but\nUm it's something I was against for years and years and years for fused all invitation I finally\nUh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over and one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and uh so\nUh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick in and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and there was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this sheet started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my card and paid no attention I said you know\nThere's places really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me\nYeah it was all follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nJanelle to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh\nOh four feet above me was the miss shape the spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they want I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately ... what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song but I'd never heard really is I Can't strain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just felt a looming\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you've got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly and not only in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world they don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need acquiring and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling dreamed because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on\nNegative spirit and Philip people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey you're really really helped you know very\nVery seldom outta the house of clients that I've helped or the last three decades now have nots\nThat you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and\nI don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really do in business\nOr a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of\nA negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments and they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy a track negative spirit and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old great youthful but I mean think of\nThe moon and she didn't hurt me\nLate it and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good mix them costs just for you know\nMost all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some

sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm\nAnd affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves

them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden demonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the

most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm listeners negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the

other side gets off\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing exercises\nIt's been teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time for these spirits out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but\nIt's not my job and people who hire me I work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their body is energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get written down\nGeorgia I Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call

kinds of things in past life helping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be giving is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is is that once I teach people how

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but afterwards I woke up right\nAfter and sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all that she has and consuming ...\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a ... dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that\nYou can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened Keith thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't you're okay where are you\nAh I'm engaged in ... um I had a um a thing and then I couldn't believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little bit to engage them and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if the devil real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was down and you know when I Lived in a a a God and I was like whoa you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe\nI so I it's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later\nThen what happened then I started seeing in these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them right when it seemed like everybody and when he had friends he everything he did he touch with no I mean you have and when my ... in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one kid he didn't have none okay\nNow these kids that you know and go oh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it it's not been told me that he was willing to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have the time and um I Believe it was kind of be just to show me\nThat you know how it works and whatever you know and then I bought a church in a\nA chemical about it and he told me oh you know you go to church you know and I'm so we'd go to church but what was the church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn the early on the church all over the place\nAll of our you around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the ...

black car they came up alongside me there was a big truck in the far left lane I was in the right hand lane and she split the difference between us\nAnd she turned her whale and I.

mentally and balanced to me um\nBut she was and I both seem to be telling the truth\nAnd her face her hair kept falling in her face she ... the ... old and I I'm you know she just [noise] I I think she has a a mental problem\nWell we don't know that but uh you know they both came across as telling the truth they didn't come across as bad people and it was just a horrible situation though just\nHorrible\nIn the next step with someone else\nThat could be that could very well be a war you know ... years if he did anything if he did anything he should have said look\nI was Seventeen years

knows who everybody is now\nBut you're never there I mean he could on his back to them it could've been a lot of things\nMy point is that if you're going to pull a gun like that it's very dangerous people could have been shot innocent people let 'em go\nIf a guy was robbing a bank you knew or in their view run in the store some guy comes in with a gun and says you know give me the money you open

ancient aliens really excited\nAbout that you should look this up while you were a year\nWhile he was such a fast track and um so I just there overnight and a personal note I had a sick cat who passed away\nYesterday so it was really emotionally are very very difficult time he was my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he he was eleven\nNow that's not tools for cat is\nNo it's not as I said I was really hoping he'd be here a few more years and um\nBut his time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep\nAbsolutely told me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the ... demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nThat is their mission and along the way they brought with them\nThey're a sentient teaching state the the ... are very clear that some of the watchers brought in various crafts and technologies with them they clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and and other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this is a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven\nAnd the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels ride the cosmic conduit and dwell in God's throne\nAnd that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou would think they would walk them\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you cut out the church in the scenario you have no need for the pope send the priest and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach you\nCan do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans [noise]\nTake it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to become more holy to become more complete if you answer no then chase them as demons chase them is giants if you answer yes\nAnd you really you now you're you're getting into the innermost esoteric secrets of the most closely guarded secrets of all human kind the secrets that the day whatever government or new world order type authority you subscribe to these are the secrets they do not want you to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum Audi ultimately\nWell you mentioned something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWill there isn't in perception I mean the the the the scenes were absolutely clear in their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by the arcane journal Michael is also sometimes referred to as ...\nWho is who established the priesthood of which she says was a member of the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of\nThe devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nWho sued amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the Renee sound so it was a belief was developed that the Sarah from were actually humans who would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers describes the\nThe heavenly thrown a God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this and go why are these people ... and ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nWell I never knew in my garden and I never knew there were only in my old man in

month right\nAnd it sure is it always gets hit in October doesn't it\nOver and you know we had big drops in February a thousand points for a couple of days I'm about fourteen hundred points this week but they're raising rates into weakness this was really was you know\nComing to bear right now this is the longest bull market in history we exceeded that an August late August the U.S and the and a thirty five hundred days without a twenty percent decline there's a real bubble economy you know created by the central bank stocks are wildly overvalued\nWell gold and silver is extremely undervalue the nature of my business uh you know so we're just waiting on the sidelines here but uh the the ratio is right now like a Nineteen twenty nine levels\nAnd what's driving this ah Georgia's stock buybacks um you know to drive the market they're buying their stocks back apple just hear the train dollars Amazon followed a week later well that's because the stock buybacks that's not because of robust you know a activity out there and so on\nAnyway so that that's what's really uh the danger facing a perhaps Monday are going in the next week could be the margin debt which is four times larger than anything in history when\nMargin calls come in and they either have to raise the cash or sell stocks and that just you know just\nJust accelerate the whole decline guy they see\nCharles thank you

violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy drawing them\nPractice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel ... and ... it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become\nStronger than these kinds of environments and soda negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't we in the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so to monitor spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing but I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police\nSay shot him and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal things I wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the homes from time to come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional the habit cleared out one\nAnd I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAh and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around
