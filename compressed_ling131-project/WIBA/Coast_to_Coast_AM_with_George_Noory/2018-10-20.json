an alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the I an app for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are respected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in the treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles forever range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk\nAbout that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand to think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nThat is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand a armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin uh the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting [noise]\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nA and the things that they represent they paint the west is what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know I used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court to\nEven started to you know hint at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting potent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their fence ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick this up on the

space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nA appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nThey're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way\nOh they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nLeverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I either the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might I mean there's there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what ... what are your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nYeah but if you've been watching my mom and then so solemn and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nAnd the so called ... and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nThey could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nI'm Merrill ... ah they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but

Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived there had been\nA oh obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly um uh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered or had heated battles with them\nA there have been some near collisions and the south China Sea was Chinese vessels\nHow do you see this or what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick current Richard and we had one here recently with the U.S her shirt done Decatur destroyer\nUh in the grieving reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos set it flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nThe Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west I'm terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared in case the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any in time scenario uh in in in that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got in to say is ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the big dog mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president oh el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and to establish a gala fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air to want to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing his state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that some\nOf these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our allies the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here are confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know it's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nAll suddenly ... it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO ostensibly use to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it within Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or you know ... to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic world view of of the the ... of ... and I think that you find that they're not involved with the the cheese are not involved with Assad ah they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia and Riyadh in Tehran is going to continue a buddy ... if they're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and you know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them or the Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and\nThey have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the influence so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia as well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with a band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments

talking near death experiences in much more jarring or open lines segment let's go to Dan in granite falls Washington a Dan welcome good morning\nRichard yeah\nThey're the last many days many days my ailments are or many and um I had an epiphany they saw something very important\nAll right what did you see I\nSaw a God I for one thing I've ever been so much\nUm you will see a your life are all these different events that you choose the one with that one would ever you could get to pick because you can pick\nAnd your guy will advice you well um you can view some of that life\nUh and yes you do get to choose and um you ... when you do me a ... is your soul family that may have been a they switch 'em or they switched roles uh depending upon what they're learning experiences are\nSo you can come back with a several of the people that you've been a living or incarnate it from a previous life\nHere's the problem I have sort of philosophically with without a and is it possible that we reincarnate I suppose I I don't happen to believe it that's just me but he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example\nA to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and pleasing men but we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advice us in the end the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise]\nThen they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships all relieved\nUm oh I I I understand that when when a child is young there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take and it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern\nSo we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves and they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us\nIt is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guys\nAll right

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two\nColonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst group and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of uh items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are\nAnd that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion ... for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going and talking about\nThe possible renewal of a twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nReally does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nUm that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nA civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know potent of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nWell as a combination of things I don't if not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nI'm voting for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nWas you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that putting his doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corporation a predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere's a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met for taking time over the top\nSide for the interruption I got to jump in here will pick us up on the other side of the lives of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis years do you mean
