O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carpet in cash is we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed bars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh soil because it's been ... and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt ... this was much Clinton fresh water in those glaciers is there is a North American\nOceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um [noise] but yes\nThe waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara foreign within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nBut the Martians are\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia does really pushing it space program much I mean they want you to the ... are you assess and they bring us back ah well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of\nTheir cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm\nThe revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question which is\nAre they going to allow private space launched companies my I guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise]\nAnd uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they sign up no\nGo zone or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um ... um\n\n\n\nThey October twenty third what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nSpicy ... why why why we've got the object everyone's talking about like the football or soccer jak inexperienced mixture you vote\nThe first iron radio broadcast awards to show your support for your phone now if I Walk towards our God\n\nEvery rock and roll lovers is anyway let's take a trip back to this week in rock 'n' roll history this weekend Nineteen Seventy five Paul Simon issues is for solo album still crazy after all these years gone it last fifty ways to\n... fire archive of thirty for thirty\nUniversity of Utah is on lockdown I'm Carmen Robert Fox news a manhunt in Salt Lake City for a gunman who shot and killed a woman on the campus of the University of Utah\nOn line and when you get off limits safely and in complete control nice to know combined secure communications private browser virtual credit card editor by security features that you can search shocked to sell their social I put out corruption I think you're paid I never get out yourself the mail or credit card again you talked to to like enemy to stay\nSafe secure anti that download my students from the store today and get one year free worst fast\nNo Thirteen ... W why be a [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell go back to coast to coast Robert ... with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space a far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven and a I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been earth orbit I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they get on a small space station which we cannot have\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm\nCan have it pretty soon\nBut the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these are entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can too and one third the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nBut it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy west and the twentieth century you illiterate armies could no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world and other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is\nA a military force that exists well a ... ... ... presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and\nUm and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um you know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those beams or they would launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not that I feel\nIf you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um we could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm\nFinished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show delighted though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead ...\nUh okay All right well here's the thing um [noise] there there\nIsn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say ah for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more\nAnd I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nTies in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding uh having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic\nAt this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some\nValue and uh and and and\nHe makes change for those claims that people could get a exploration missions finance mine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nYou have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question profiles of people

A. dot com [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast George ... with you and our guest Brandon ... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the north eastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on\nE. and maps environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters Brandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a go for the parents that college even before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually\nI actually got a day job and that I study the parents like holiday and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good what did you see the they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Donahue apple was for a year in the at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teamed up their sports why\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brant\n[noise] well um you know I ah I have a degree in psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied um basically the environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going in and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with the go study\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away theloop nation interpretation over active imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nThe individuals who have these terrifying and counter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTale of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes countered with the facts and have some new perspective and insights in the cause of these\nThrowing encountered um it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theory and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know you know I've been picking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of goes the encounter\nYou know I spent years just getting first hand account going to anyone he would talk to me about goes on all of a conventional everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that but I came up with some of these maybe theory\nA and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed a cow and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theory thought they also reviewed the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters book\nWill then you bring a dose of real science to the picture\nI think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article it kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould've you concluded to brag about what the grossly experience might be a real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghostly encountered that that are out there I Believe are there are some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes the one of the\nI think there is I'm\nIn my in my view I take them more a side base view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perception those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ghostly encounters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters a so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity\nAnd when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and a great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on\nTime that I've had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm\nPretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nAnd then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of thing so I I really just enjoyed not enjoy it but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the female label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the

I'll call them goes enter into our universe I'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe\nAnd she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared you to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise] oh one morning I'm Me and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenalin and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nYou know and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and may went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I thought something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in\nThere by you know it's dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I don't put myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like the stress signals that to me with the cat and distress and the kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like that so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many paranormal experiences occur Brandon because the person who\nDied who comes back\nNever had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening I'm so [noise] you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through with other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional me you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist the memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these\nUm bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so it's a pretty high number eighty percent of the huge yeah\nYeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the thief shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased\nCouldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm can come out of a ghost encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like that\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of reparations ... what's so special about that\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em\nThere's there's some tests out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know I ... the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and and that doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing ... FM our eyes and eat jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout\nAll rise as well so you you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back we'll also take phone calls get another couple of stories of some of your studies when we come back\nTo find out more about two nights just log on to ...

story\n[laughter] and they've all won don't think they do and I was really shocked that you know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's a\nThere's still some colleagues who come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they you know follow it up with but you can't tell anyone or anything like that but the response has been pretty positive\nI'm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human since you know the dawn of time you know there's this go stuff [noise]\nUm so ... you know it's not that bizarre or out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents that college he is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline dislike social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university\nThey are the ones the clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is for those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWant something that has baffled usual for Brandon that you don't have the answers you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nHolds her guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it goes moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seemed to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning sign off glowing light appeared next to my bad light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent die the night before unexpectedly his\nDeath occurred around the same time I saw the image of my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time so this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional shift related to the process of dying in a in a way set up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glowing light operation a those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife\nMay know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well but this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but it also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this is well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be you know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're\nWe all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes\nFrom humans as well an animal sure does show you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone who's walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only Constand an all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a Pulitzer guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well since since the first ghostly encounter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fails we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the amount of always been linked now there is some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost they encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes the encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president\nYou know if a if a EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes\nUh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher\nWorried um so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with goes laying out or even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt the room felt energized or like there was it felt like a of electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand\nThe corps operate will be made by means of offering circular which has been filed with unqualified by the U.S
