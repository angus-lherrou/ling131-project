introduce alone on student loans by the way now exceeds Ninety billion dollars a year Alan ... the founder of the student loan justice done or group\nIs an outspoken advocate for the millions of Americans whose lives have been truly ruined by the practices of student loan lenders he's the author of the student loan scammed the most impressive to you and history and how we can fight back he's also been selected as one of the seven financial heroes by\nMoney magazine back in two thousand nine and here he is back on coast it goes Alan welcome back my front yard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans northern they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we've probably at it and I think I was about a year ago we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now sitting officially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nCollection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that that's right yeah\nUm you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other uh no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes to I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards alone this just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh Tate\nThis rehabilitation at the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents and get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nPeace in the ... these agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nUh than alone the remains it's good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these\nDefaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nStay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nJust enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from Allen for these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans\nUh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer hum\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of\nCrony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's uh something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared\n... federal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or ...\nCompletely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp\nThe beltway ... ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guest who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fish yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when the company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises chew a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] uh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent to use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera can keep up with their budgets um you know I was just\nIn Syracuse recently and the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices\nBut also really ... the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge a huge amount just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know were seen comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nNinety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses

us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was to lungs is falling into\nA is a lending system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties an interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall you know a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory a dinner gear mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... this is not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look how great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to\nUm you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four years I\nShould have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you [noise]\nAnd they got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big sign they\nSupport sealed and he left right after the whole ... oh\n[laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I drive a little bit of traits old uh anyway uh order company I work or I got on egg wildly\nAnd when a company went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I think I owe here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone or because I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing well and I think also you know\nYou probably in Lawrence you've had more experience than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for\nHundreds or oh I I think it was a horse just don't think well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going and last but not thousands of dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive in I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I thought it was not up for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to the cell and what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this lanes of some stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools [noise] ah as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook on it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nOK already knew the bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three\nThese programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou worked for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital or the nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being just qualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that alone is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little plane to censor the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right show at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exchanged email that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nThey have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final culture with you in just a moment of Iran coast to coast am [noise]\nGoes insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm going to end now Android for ... book [noise] listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime daughter goes to goes to um done common downloaded today\nThis is talk therapy intended to tell you why [noise]\nIraq Today fast hurting here all the time today don't waste register\nOnline and only\nTime I got my county board of elections like size seven seven seven fat or possession repair mind set nice and warm up by now bounce off of animal seven\n\n\n\nWe [noise]\n\nTo talk to George Nouri called the wild card line at eight one eight five zero one for one zero in on the first time caller line is a one eight five zero one for civil to one to talk to free from east of the Rockies call eight hundred eight to five five zero three three\nFrom west of the Rockies to greet go eight hundred six one age eight to ... to reach George VI escape you scrape named George nine seven three one two three sin Georgia text messaging each time they won eight to nine eight six five to one from the gateway to the west\nCoast to coast am with George Nouri ... follow just Nick Pope joins me as we talk about aliens\nAt the Pentagon looking forward to that all about the CIA and the latest leaks looking forward to talking with Nick so beyond belief that's our television programs fifth year hundreds of episodes and you can watch a few free\nGoing to our website coast to coast am dot com wool over to the bottom of the home page and you'll see the beyond belief link just click that it'll take you straight there ... technology was talking to a doctor a couple of days ago and he says you can't believe the incredible things we're doing which themselves listen to this\nTrips to the dermatologist can be expensive with that in mind Dr Nathan Newman designed a product from his vast knowledge of stem cell research it is available without a doctor's prescription luminous uses stem cell technology not actual themselves placed into a serum\nFor application to problem areas on the face and neck like fine lines wrinkles and bags under the eyes here's Dr Neumann to explain\nIn the beginning we were using adult stem cell technology for burns and all sorts and wound healing these treatments we found the skin was getting much better in the laboratory we went and looked at how these cells tried to steal we found that they're using chemical language to get together and the chemical language\nIs one we've taken and put into luminous and product that we have purely the chemical language without the cells themselves\nLooming out is not available in stores but it is available from healthy looking dot com find genuine luminous products and especially the limit us there um with the highest concentration of Dr Neumann a P.

welcome back it's always great\nTo have you great to be back on the shirt I don't know how you doing these days yeah good thing [noise] where do we last\nSee each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nAnd I'm now was that before off to your life event in Lake City which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is my new document tree that I put out to tell the story all off and taking\nYour credit cram a care but you can take July it's that story and and really to\nTry in one human trait detail as as best as I can meet entire story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey aren't really be staggering this town that they have been the biggest single revelation now the UFO community for I I think decade I the only story that I think comes\nBy and I would say they would die if the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation\nThat off to a decade to know and the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel that the day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project we ... we haven't been doing this with knowing trapped there are no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid come along and you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail\nBecause I think the problem with the story in one sense for years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just the confusing mass if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen the landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to their benefit one but now the public have been absent people out there thinking yeah well there's the video and then the walk by and then the millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how we all fit together so that that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and give people in a few of\nMy incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically about your rural\nWell I took a lot on on on that one and it was quite a I diverge and for me usually I I just sit in the interview\nThey eat and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut it in and I wish they'd taken it out and of course I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo alien to the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so scripted the entire movie ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way\nI have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn in in that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Michael long I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it\nFrom from start to finish and that's a departure from a dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I was a departure from me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly\nI as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the\nConfusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but\nThey don't go to many conferences and ... and ... you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we caught it on to all the platforms\nThat the young people need to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has fall down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon wonder reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization I'm E. T. I. O.\nRight yes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of that\nThe U.S government has said he'd always says in the soil situation's only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nAnd indeed the the individual who wrote that the guy to fight\nIntelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense carry name project ... he would not want to go too far down that road he had some play the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book of Asians I think it is where it refers to say as being the print some power of the air and mine so I think is where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea that UFOs might be demonic\nYes and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it it it's frustrating in a than because and and it's almost ... clay ironic in another way that\nYou know you have a bunch of people in in the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry dependence you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it research he ... her scientific manner and we come up against skepticism and he might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism is ... ... the soil to clinic hole or intellectual\nA human nature skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it it's a ... probably trying to build the trip and skepticism itself I mean it to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking\n'em say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic quality just in one sense it's swapping one on your plate fringe belief for another so\nWe'll these by these people were skeptics told they will believe those but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons Nick\nWe're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates with other ... would you do in the ...

lot at the ministry of defense and and they fight the um law to oils in in the what's now being a ten year program to declassify and release them\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of a alien intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course ... those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly we we would set aside our differences down here on it if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more

more like clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government files we are seeing government say effectively will look here is our data or as much of it is\nWe can really you know without compromising\nClassified information I'm ... and ... and the ultimate irony of this might be genuinely government don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mall in\nCourt or if we are dealing with something above and beyond comprehension that it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to what you say\nYou never know you you you never know you know when you look at Leonardo da

with the ministry you did\nAbsolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they like cakes and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet stick myself submarines or a mosque by some trade has button that sort of thing\nSo we looked there is a classic low probability high impact and Oreo probably one ... but if it does the payoff is so big wind on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about ...\nSome street can dog ate the ministry of defense going into the briefly in about two thousand and

I've been doing it\nAnd he I think that interest has take waited until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative\nAmy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of of the uh science technology in space command tea and and the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel evolves into formal congressional hearings\nThe question arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology in space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a military and intelligence\nProgram and I I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed one of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's bad\nSo so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact that there is congressional in traffic we know the ... law being going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing\nMyself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far\nThey haven't really been for a national daily newspaper reports that are actually going into the fine but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us one us oh no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster who's out there doing what they do to get the word on their\nAbsolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only ... the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said we they only in the Pentagon and you know if you don't like the way that you you off portrayed on TV sometimes run your own documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily\nAgreed on line or two\nThey yeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my own feeling the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services\nCommittee in ... and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering before articles I've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line oh I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course of off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we don't have the right things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's certainly online version but now I guess my ... my reactions should be well great like\nGets it gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies hey Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again hey\nHey ah first of all you had that you'll put up a show about a special report about working last in being at home and you know I got I got I've co signed for student loans you know kind of stuff so I I gotta work\n[laughter] but anyway make great program may great crew time of your top notch guy but a Mitt what an honor it is to talk to you my my friend or not my friend but third grade on her thank you Brian hey listen I\nMy wife and I are achy namely why a lot got pretty religiously\nAnd in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like fourteen or something like that come out in the fifties\nThey they they sign they said they scientifically proved the UFO didn't exist\nNow you said earlier that the some of the believers in your new book or or movie uh we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the disc labor were people from project we book and I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up your\nWord games Brian will talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about ... the con didn't report\nYes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO\nOr at least they want it to the public out and and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the one thing of project Blue Book um which was kind of just like the program went dark\nOf course this is the famous\nUh Poland a memo which which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake and on ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long\nHow many years well\nMy goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British Government to project in Nineteen Ninety One\nSo uh yeah that's more years ago and I can't mention of the of course I did that um for much of the early nineties and they
