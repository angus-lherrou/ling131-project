is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's frightening as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI I don't know what's going to happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they don't have enough people\nTo to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much to take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a phone compact with kill 'em but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked in the I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things Tio first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast\nAnd that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he would run and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold but weren't self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or tried to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has kids\nActually a little one still at home not little one but a young white and blue and white and we had a president and it's something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I Will pay for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did as if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either when\nI was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ...\nAnd it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now it's time\nYou get a deal dies we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy that song if the death when ward\nYep home if he doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet on the war\nI that I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and she doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about this policy he knows he is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or a toilet fair market value or even tried to get it for less than I think when people say let's let the country run his business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the\nRepublican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on ... and and you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I ... I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow one thing but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like\nThat but if he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that with their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise]\nUh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nBut you know yeah I mean ah you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and end it like that\nIn the head of Connecticut and um house in ... Connecticut it's worked out the square feet I don't know my wife and I just read all around it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't have the ... got to be very big\nWhile he's got that company like air being beat up the rent to our house how such and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and\nThey solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... oh\nYeah and I I Would subscribe to that it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes one of the things that it's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that is actually demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K.

well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nKnew how would you like to have a truck behind you would know driver's city now\nOr you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a ... and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to a a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada the United states Mexico central and South America\nOr we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need their oil we've got water\nYeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nAm one of those always missiles no guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening [noise]\nUh and if in fact I say I say what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north and the south the you know that the south\nIs not having children there for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my\nQuestion is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most popular state ranking New York state and also the Knicks has become the largest city out raking I still don't hear\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather we're Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct and and and my new book the book they came out last year called upside profiting from the pound demographic shifts the head we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada uh uh\n[noise] Arizona and New Mexico or the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million want to buy real estate bite in Florida now and just sit on it\nIn ... but listen they the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be if you're not going to ask what is it well when will begin to\nYou know ... and I told her I said\nIt hasn't started\nAnd what does it could be huge\nIt's going to be charged with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market\nOff the charts huge can't believe it or one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of job I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas this is unbelievable\nShow ...

friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as there's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have of it I was a I was afraid of that that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues that after college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate adviser\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\n[noise] I I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientists historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who's the\nChief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he's set their Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in in our colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's a bit I\nI think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast result they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find another traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that it's just as kind of blew me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you\nKnow Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in goes they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not and then I just\nKind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBut at the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep\nI thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and uh it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence and\nIt was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see um\n[noise] there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nAn eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought\nThis is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident\nKnows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that you know that\nThere could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I I ...\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passed in the north end to would be island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then\nEverything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stocked and once again I felt this this light in this warm and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about

with us of course we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a I'm\nIn a region American community and we had this this older man who passed away\nAnd he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me [noise]\nAnd uh as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and\nHe was so to me\nAnd he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there is nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it than than the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he no he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nUh I I think I Know now but uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to to appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it\nAt the college and I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get but ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list I probably could have had a hundred people if\nWe could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple\nThat are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks\nIn the course into the course um and ah it it it's been a wonderful\nExperience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different to you know types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book and we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine\nAh that's ah a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call the residual hunting I suppose they that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I\nYou know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases it was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my\nImpression that uh and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I Am visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter
