for one one series of books\nAnd a documentary film by that title in fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series he's broaden his uh his Web is net er and his focus again\nOr the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project but one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery and which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nTo the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell it may have been focusing on missing for one one for the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so areas with a new work it's an art ... big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\n[noise] hey George thanks again for having me a absolutely\nNo times on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it in your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like big foot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it'll say wild man and\nI hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us and has been documented in and it shows this historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when your first year can you be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd what kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that\nIndependently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big fund encounter in the mountains of the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe you have Twenty years as a police officer or you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nNot going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury and I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that\nWould be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they

that they used was ... than a crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this these samples could've been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba to a very brilliant scientist who has written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this [noise] she listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it [noise] and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jumped into specifics from ... new book big bought Wildman and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what Cal silver haired take us into the break\n\nUm Harry how\nAll\nKnown me\n\nIn ...

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year so\nHave intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods and even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America\nHave there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have Howard while or giant human going out and that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat chocolate with you on

shows how ... decided to leave his farm going to live in that type of environment\nAnd grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you've made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I think it was like yeah\nYeah\nAnd the description was pretty close and\nI don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some exporters wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so [noise] but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore note that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the

quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nOf these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people I'm just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that the general consensus\nSort of match what other tribes who dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and here's an occupied land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and its\nYou know and people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been to bump but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo one thing I did with ah the gambling film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect to apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Dick foot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your account the news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\n[noise] well I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentation to conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine or of people from China and I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's campfire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited yeah at work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like ... five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just sign of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally non hostile shy want to get away from people when they encountered what they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the Fort one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nThose people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em cramped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though no no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone\nBut they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nI think when you get the trust some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall but I think you and I have talked about before about big what a what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the word hurting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound deer native ... could have done it and\nThey don't know how it goes way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am\nWe\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nStay connected to the white\nAnd jumping\nAhead this week in Nineteen Ninety three she'll Carter his only the second baseball World Series winning home run at the Toronto blue jays win game six of the world series to be the Philadelphia Phillies game to do\nAnd I can still remember every fossil moment\nYeah I'm a Phillies fan\nThat you're a high hard radio weekends for each time capsule\n\nForm call on the\nNews talk through teen ten W why be a visible anywhere you go on the I hard rainy aware downloaded no not\nI\nYou\n\nTo talk to Georgia now called the wild card minded one eight times zero one\nOne zero in on the first time caller line is the one eight zero one for civil to one to talk to free from east of the Rockies call eight hundred feet two bombs zero three three from west to the Rockies toll free go eight hundred six one eight eight to ...\nThis is ... ... am with George now\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney as they were known to do both had fragments of the individual songs put 'em together it came up with I've got a feeling that was on unleaded beat sounded pretty good that's the Beatles with of course Billy ... we're talking with Dave\nPolite is about big foot wild men and giants archived articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty to his new book and as I told ... some of these uh descriptions of the writing is just terrific on the part of reporters from long ago this is from the state ledger in Mississippi July Fourth\nEighteen eighty for the title while wizard of the woods in which\nThe reporter describes an encounter on one occasion he the creature was seen about wearing a large fish with demonic hold greed in a short space of time between his massive jaws and enormous cheat the bones being crushed\nAs if they were straws this guy came to work that day and a and did his job we're going to go to the phones in a moment looks like they're pretty full day polite is still working his magic with the coast to coast audience we'll be right back\n[noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add a trio the relation one of the leading causes of stroke mind out before too late\nWith cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device than just Ninety nine dollars to order visit cardio dot com and then you can have our D.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOr anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute to\nThink about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone\nWhich has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the ... film is real why haven't we caught this by pat on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and lingering knowing that people are watching him something\nUnusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to the skin Walker day but it the the comparison is pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking

history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been cited before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere dark\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nActually with a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of ... to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb and suck\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [noise]\nImagine that and you know there are looking to what was available at the library I still find anything someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could but you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivor and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the man who survived Indianapolis and\nYeah I was a kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd land for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell I ... the way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had didn't have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic well we're going and all of it and all that and\nOut of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers but we only base mini series\nOn foot so you're going to need ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting me help her but uh eventually over the course of several months\nWe finally met and then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it to the project tickets and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more it's like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab me ... my father was a at a ... landing craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about uh the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be\nGreat um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shed and I'm a small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle with us now where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater um victorious at us and now as well as nine other major battle\nThe accurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story [noise]\nWell it was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're basing them together I guess from people who did know there but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS ah Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really call back the land on when apple story has really man uh before I get crash and not as it is you know\nCircle back and\nThe men who marry the atomic bomb aboard the Annapolis when an army named Robert an army major name Robert Vernon and who had spent the last couple of years after the war running down all the material that they hear the Germans where you try to develop their own atomic bomb\nOr on the continent if you're\nThe one that can be and then burn and very simple components of little boy on an island\nUm that final breathing yet or I've been to Europe and and the conflict and though and writing the book we try to pull back that ran than bringing in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the point of view them in a dish and to hush money over his head and for your call and tell me you've got ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where you\nHave to recognize that even the men were at any time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what\nI'll tell you what do we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes day\nNow I'm On the news talk through college and tell you why me a\nShut down often gets a kidnapping sitting on your terms there's never been easier with the radio at any store or on line why da da da dum\nAnd their mess whether you volunteer bike walk advocate educate support\nEvery action you take moves closer to a world free of multiple sclerosis and motivates family friends and neighbors to join and build the image movement\nThe national MS decide he addresses the challenges of each person affected by MS bike funding cutting edge research driving change through advocacy facilitating professional education collaboration with MS organizations around the world\nAnd providing programs and services designed to help people with MS and their families ... progress on M.

everything we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great ... um\nWell it was it and then more for that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the safety uh here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commander had him at a point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive\nHe was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military um he went around saying on doors after ...\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down the stretch thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... than he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the\nEnd of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case there were four groups\nOf four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available with only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and\nWere starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others who although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties loose\nAre there any reason to send them to come to the idea that they can train them so out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one court the water through it into the into his now and thinking that that would train of thought that well of course that didn't and then other when you take\nSmall heard that he water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin coping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBought that full bird blood cells ...\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it'd sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and here with an army pilot he was transporting a general who wanted and you know that the general death in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's now report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action though he thinks well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I get the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I thought it should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman Richard ... have\nPassed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and we're at the ... father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he would\nWe are talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing
