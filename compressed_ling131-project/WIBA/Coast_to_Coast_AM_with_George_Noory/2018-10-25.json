E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's love in Hillsdale dot com [noise] All right Claudia Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nThen national event how are you okay thank you I'm a ... a lot of a lot of the topics and points that you make\nOur our ... ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them they know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria should ban and all of these regions that are going through wars\nAnd uh we have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and the Gen down and they have in Europe the you which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on mhm and I find very interesting aside and I don't know if I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise]\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent\nThe progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others and also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Aristotle and ... but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and abstract sense\nIn which I'm a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as in view it that way conformity in uniform me that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in addition to that in economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian the government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that has imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and the people don't have a right to come to the United states of America\nThey don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happening here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ... of haggling marks and then the angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the row they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process oriole way of agreeing with you All right

be a matter of my heart radio station [noise]\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't\nKnow that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica as best we can debate ideas are vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there\nWould get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to\nSay don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement\nUh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say it again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this\nAnd you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are gonna go stepped on but\nYou have to wait and doing things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAre owned by ... team\nWe will talk this week and see the rest of the story

December I Can't believe it too much about going anywhere\nI guess my nature [laughter]\nI tell you we love your standard I got to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director\nAnd I go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder out I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually matured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast\nStance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they just stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research [noise] well\nI think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word begat but it looks like there was about one point six climates per star ... feet per star and our galaxy the Milky Way has ... billion stars\nAll that means one hundred and sixty billion planets so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course we're not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and it leaves plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth now I realize that the clear fusion for example or you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop mushroom part of the world was created and four thousand B. C.\nThat's right can't be too late beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be [laughter] yeah just a little [laughter] that was a ... a A R ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter]\nThe ultimate piano hurtful thing [noise] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there\nAnd there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the mirror throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nSo you never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's really\nStand to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of how we bring expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that one we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there were a life out there we see it mhm you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think a ... it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped\n[laughter] and\nAnd so uh what most of us have learned that\nIt's more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of ... and the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number all oh no [laughter]\nNo ... and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that it'll have\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work\nOr we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to saying that's

and I'm Still on stop coming to\nThe voters an extra physical for people and I've just written this new book that does include big foot ... some ... that's the only a ... a retired police officer and white all New York that back in Nineteen Seventy six\nHad a near face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic by federal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his wife and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual NYU hall in New York very soon as names off the Ryan got one\nAnd so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy you know you for already endorsing the book\nYes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences in covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAre absolutely and and build this uh this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have heart there\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer dog one\nAnd went actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and that I've had dialogue with officer Godwin since then he's very credible and it was not only him\nBut seven other officers are over it two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the UFOs ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet ... what's your take\n[noise] well I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell ya story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like of course you know if you're reading not which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book it talks about the ... the thought of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called enough when\nThose Neff alum had unnatural sex acts with the beast those field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot south watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these now\nI'm a you know made it with\n... and I find anything can be to\nNow think about this\nAnd a lot of these cases there seems to only be one foot print there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends and I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax\nThan perhaps\nThis creature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eye witnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think of the old Patterson give them and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] I don't know it ... I'll say this though if that was a fake it was a darn good one\nA darn good one and it would have to be someone you would think that would be gargantuan to fit in to that type of a outfit to be able to make that come off as real and another thing George if you think about this\nAs you watch the creature walk away you see the arms swinging and the arms look very long they certainly look longer

John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there [noise]\nThat strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other and the and there was another in the past year was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife ... are as well because supposedly governor Connelly with head off with one of the bullets well\nNo you're right the governor's convoy was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut where was a ... was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with in front of Kennedy\nAnd his wife was to his ...\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nDirt cheap there and I can't remember if the if the seat was with Connelly and his wife\n... where you where you know them well you said you don't read the con Connelly if I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it would have been a row of seating there and and the\nDriver I or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you do to ... to can you turn Tom spike up

I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks to\nThe ... thing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was your Secret Service agents at the front seat\nAnd then a second row with Governor primary and his wife and his wife was to his law and the president and Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nLet's turn I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was in the front dry bean because everybody accused him out turning around shooting the president\nUh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this study that as well because William Cooper is one that was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left handed if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so that means they'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn\nAnd then make perfect shot you know with his left hand\nAnd everybody wants to see that\nYeah so I you know I don't buy that\nOne
