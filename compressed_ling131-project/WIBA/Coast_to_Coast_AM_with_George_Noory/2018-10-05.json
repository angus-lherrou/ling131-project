your dad I'm I fight your cat books for my nieces and nephews and I just I absolutely love them but You're welcome\nOn that listening to your ... interview with David Limbaugh on their face a monument that on what squirm a held on to the fighting with armed to build a monument a hundred and Thirty years ago and by that and it's called the national mining the forefathers it stands for fate\nMorality law\nEducation and liberty and in the ... monument and the United states of America and hardly ... their people just don't know about where is it again\nIt's in climate math chased that mhm and I just kind of discovered it on a on a second I visit to planet and twice ten and since then I've been researching\nAnd I've been able to come up with I have original documents and things that they use to try to raise money that's with during the civil war some money was tight\nThere's connection to George Washington there's also on a connection to Abraham Lincoln but they wanted a representation of this elaborate ladies Harley ... every school at ... library\nOn and I I I feel like I I Want to share that with people and it's just if\nIt's a male you just did with millions of people and I my and I might add um [noise] this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know and treat the people involved like their metaphors and and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional mopping and that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very bad places\nYou know I had to Lindsey Graham had a ramp during the\nDay I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and they said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates hold on it because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution so I think he's apt to bend the law it helped the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go\nAnd that's what's going to give some of the moderate you know problems and so that might get the he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done it's it's really galvanized the Republican base because they're\nUh you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know and it's tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\n[noise] any any time any one of the things talk and support the violation of due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution of the law to to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and what\nSaved me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and said\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of the people uh you know who've allow themselves to\nIt weaponized oh oh ah oh an apology to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think that leadership that the Congress and American apology\nWe shall see how this all unfold gatherings website so

like tour films since you were a kid having chew\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William Castle wanted to direct a a\nRosemary's Baby but he has such a reputation doing gimmicky movie that they didn't let him do that but yet\nWhen I was a kid [noise] uh I was terrified of these I mean I I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island\nWould have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's you know and we were watching a move my dad and I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nCurrently I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching the movie the kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature feature right next to him are hiding behind the recliner some time\nAnd I think that having heroic women and these movies that evening star wars you know and now the doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's just it's\nThese are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies and they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably [laughter] not really [laughter] [noise] Fifteen to twenty Fifteen to Twenty years old I thought I Would I Would say forty ... twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would bet I bet you that a little higher maybe maybe fifty percent\nThirty to forty percent usually\n[noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I thank you yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that baby baby a twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the ... year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year old and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to um enjoy film in their home and the trouble going to it's\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and\nGo on well whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual would I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film and theater with an audience but a lot of\nTime that you ... and that's your ... your business\nSo I I I'm I'm biased because I'm watching the audience ...\nThat's what you do so that's

to have you\nThink that George it's great to be here and how are you what's new I'm Glad it's\nBeen a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time saying why now and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing\nHow does that I\n[noise] well it started when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and\nI had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been what somebody I shouldn't have been with a closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver room\nMy body on a motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical bloom\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware\nOf the tangles up my lab ... you know now I have to study legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good in Paris which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember that [laughter] but I've heard\nTales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table and my God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seed planted then too that got me on the path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong\nAnd I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town that they tell me where with\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to a Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you [noise]\nI was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I have a lot in the style Jeff\nFor Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there family still there\nI have some family um they moved out to Paris and township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nUh-huh airborne height really yeah well you\nKnow tell me where cars you must remember the the the street\nOh I don't I doubt who was a bit was at a busy street yeah\nStreet but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre going to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes and do a remote viewing now that you were on\nTelegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right

preach shielded\n... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you're going to ... just been elected a vice president of the term psychological shows you usually get into that but this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which will remember\nI Do and timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no\nUm [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history and that was a big empowerment\nFor me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nOut you're not ready and\nI didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at trance personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is really the only\nWay I you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh\nActually ... brewery what she'll remember I remember the Detroit lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do the huge do college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... yes well I'm\nSure right although micro breweries have taken over\n... ... what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a sin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intentions of very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something you know beyond our normal capacity\nThat becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter]\nI think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures expect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... are in Ecuador\nAnd you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more and his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important too is a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things that they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nActual true and I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our ... our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about this\nStory reincarnation of on a little child but was born with reports march and we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were website is her name and we've done it linked up for you were close to ... dot com\nThat makes it really easy\n... six days a week it was a great way to keep up on the east coast\nWe we do program rejection was fascinating to stream was upcoming didn't go weekly free audio groups so much for the most recent up on the go to ... dot com boom\n\n\nYou know when you want to be\n\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already amusing\nDon't miss the iconic images\n\nIn a way time travel is factors not just speculation goes do you\nWhy be\nA year die crime scene investigation they use on CBS with who are you by the who has a theme song three more series and the franchise would appear with theme songs by those who still think my favorite though was CSI Miami with David Caruso saying cheesy lines like this song looks learn\n[laughter]\n[noise] no\n\n\n\nYou are listening to the coast to coast hundred and Seventy five people to do and we get Seventy nine\nThousand at ... dot com or goal of course is eighty thousand people\nThat we've got a couple or get married it's something for you to meet people who understand you ever go to dinner with somebody and started talking about ghosts they might get up and leave so you want to talk to someone who understands you go to ... dot com it's free to sign up paranormal the\nDotcom\nScience is doing some incredible things these days to make people look even younger\nAging could make a wish for younger day but since we can't go back in time we turned her products to give us a more youthful look no there is instantly ageless with immediate results on bags into your eyes\nSpores roast beef fine line and wrinkle know needle no pain just a simple cream applied lately it's great for men and women and can easily be applied before makeup doctors agree\nInstantly age loose works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you want to imagine a cream that can certainly remove your under I bag we're going to put into the past with our good friend Dr Sonia by what to\nDo this product or even if the if it works it's called instantly edge last and the idea that it works very quickly if you just have a very small amount and then you pay for you might feel a little bit puffy I had just looked\nAt what's in the product ... and one of them is something called ... which is kind of a darling and tell us the right now at the\nTighter than it actually relaxes the muscle is also called talk of sent to relax I from work like I can literally waiting at the very end and still the case which almost like a clay minerals and they're making the skin\nTight area actually increasing tension on the skin to push that ... had back\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.

bit from year one of the time we have remaining here about conscious and how important the role playing with all those what would you first of all the conscious this is\nWhy again we can't many definitions for me it's in our awareness\nAnd on a lack of awareness of what we're not aware of it so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas in this book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a period of time or a world view and interesting thing to me about world is is that we don't even know that we have um [noise]\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes their experience like walking through life with these colored glasses on\nOur experience and so we can't see those things that lie out side of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an intentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see that\nAnd I think is a remarkable aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou turn the light on what those experiences are and what shape are aware now [noise] we're placing our attention and offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness live outside of the brain\nConsciousness is\nSomething that has intelligence [noise] it is self correcting\nIt is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery milking Fannie is filled with lights and when that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness is something much bigger and our individual brain [noise] I don't think it's an athlete famine in the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like [noise] you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it does it mean you've destroyed the conscious\nOr the or the signal exactly\nKeeps comics ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all this\nSo I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time in ... the the Android he's a robot\nAnd yeah I heard a buzz or it'd be great for you to interview 'em and see it they wouldn't do it in a way that doesn't mean they want us to talk show host or she's really grew in New York\nWe're coming back with your next on coast to coast a\nRemote you know you get on to Google dot com [noise]\n[noise] we were on the radio\nWere reading or just a\nDrive with the [noise]\nThe Green Party whether you were in the new\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\nLaundry you know Fox News which will proceed to revoke his nomination of Supreme Court nominee you drove all the outcome of the vote to proceed will be your key indicator whether Senate Republican member of the need for over racial\nAnd not only works in one way or to a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy into the German and my health\nSystem better way to earn a war has built every spring back into my money in a while but you know on his back there and I can't say I don't know\nThis is Richard Ross Perot owner for carnival or research

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\nAnd I wonder Jeanne Gen W why be a\n\n\nWelcome\nBack Dr Merrill Lynch Luttrell those Marilyn in this reality court room on do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife after death\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that give them a sense of that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location and the whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population and including people with\nHigher levels of education\nSo this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHonda were younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with ice you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWants to take some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either\nGiovanni hey how's it going your group I mean it's been a war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more\nA wonder and and and and after you into this world but uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that are just really springs to mind when I heard you\nTalk about the about the forest or about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are\nVery very uh very rich culture of um of mysticism and and also ah you know being able to travel into you know in three dimensional and and uh and explore the potential of the mind through um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me over time uh the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm On my travels I was traveling to Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called luck than on negative or roughly transmitted the black a jungle\nAnd the this this black jungle is just is an illusion jungle with\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely ex board still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered\nI'm a\nLord knows what's out there but\nUh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour in my meditation I felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\n... it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit fearful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it somehow and I wanted to share that causes and if I Do believe that there's more out there ...\nAnd the more we explore the more we'll find just like you say yeah we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to shrug it off and not believing something is there what did you think of a Maryland\nI'm so grateful for that comment and the question I appreciate your support of words and I think that one of the reasons that many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is\nThat a spiritual leader or you know the mistake who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process\nUh because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have the capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this\nThe W.
