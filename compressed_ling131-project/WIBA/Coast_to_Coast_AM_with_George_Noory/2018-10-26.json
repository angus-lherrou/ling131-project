story Linda the just just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and eight people becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported it are filed dot com and Mike coast to coast AM radio broadcast then that a new ninth planet or planet act\nWas indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the ... cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shaped residue of rock dust and ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto\nTo about fifty astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes much further starting where the hype rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth\nAnd the spirit of shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like now I say planet nine when indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident that was a huge\nObject ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it was\nTwenty three and protests are brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called ... out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our ship be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math\nIs so great that it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the tech and super ... observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote tail like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this lose have planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mind and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll\nFinally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than map June\n... good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus\nSo you deliberately going\nOn November first to start another\nSurge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena\nCalifornia is astronomy\nProfessor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet no and looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system the perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it\nWe just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where it looks I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly\nJoining in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean\nWhen we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or anywhere inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in till we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like your it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what the border of\n...

won't go back to coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and\nCan have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those best estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you put your finger on\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe unfair out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem decade or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from ...\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their cities become inhabitable\nAnd that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got millions of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which\nTo a lot of the crises\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut it has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a hit in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can't get this under control\nAnd one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen million for at home may see the level rise flooding over the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that the forty eight continental US date\nFor that now has the most property at risk a study find that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes Whoopi risking that title flooding the researchers say is that global warming and sea level rise does continue\nThat in more than one million properties and Florida\nWell have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat the level right which is already\nOne of the big secret a cap in Miami by the political institution\nThere is it they get flooding constantly on full mind constantly\nFlooding on high tides they get constantly flooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political government than there are saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years\nAnd know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding\nLet's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that I mean that most of the southern tip of for it will be uninhabitable

tonight in front of the computer is sharing you win\nThe general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like ah my YouTube channel well just to three weeks ago and October third I was doing update on ... category\nThe first had it with the very distressing subject I have cats they had a cat around the world like weird\nAnd Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was in a car wreck kill\nAnd that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all and then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually\nUh the child pornography which is funny deflection that he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatory computer in order to get by on the sensitive white sands missile range and how an air force base\nDown below the solar observatory nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update had evolved from my asking my or fires YouTube channel audience on September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of flooding out of body\nTypically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone before and that's what I Would talk\nAbout when\nThe next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down\nIt was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video analyst I worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at\nA my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange and the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked\nA that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky\nFog is it like ...\nI Do not know this is extremely a translucent and uh\nWhen I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never\nMentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream\nAnd that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard or talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now some city center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature so\nAt the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening [noise]\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty grade ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives\nAnd the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and\nOne is with this living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was shown loving\nCan you describe the shape of the hiring Bush that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... these high Wrigley but they had the same texture and the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living and I said the same time and they would just float by me but kind of means\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a downloaded information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was just super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe it was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future\nI was supposed to recall this information because it was like it would be given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any subjects in your mind or your soul about who we'd be
