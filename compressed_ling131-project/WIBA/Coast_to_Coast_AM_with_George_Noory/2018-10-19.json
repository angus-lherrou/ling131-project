understanding them and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but from a logical standpoint let us know a few years ago Mr Obama\nFiled federal food against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the full proof purview of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument well no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce immigration laws some of these states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the uh [noise]\nA sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's when they don't they ... people need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean that they're ...

stuff like that if you get those same courts are stepping back and in reality they're decisions don't stand [laughter] well\nYou got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was

never gonna win California\nWell if you can turn Texas to them for the Dems those three states ... it's\nVirtually impossible to do math that makes it were a Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just get the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way by the way

see any wings couldn't see a tail or windows and he pulled it it was so intriguing they pulled his car off the roadway and share and looked at it\nAnd it was at that point he realized that it was

years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nWe'll let the times silver was trading near its production cost an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown you know I guess not but consumer reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nHoops you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can send out solicitors so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or how to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar\nAnd why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce the reporters a twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas nuclear combine let's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report\nAnd don't miss out on the ... revolution goal now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation go one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nSeven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals and lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty\nPercent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin will look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off refinished\nHardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nNow since we video on demand TV channel completely devoted to him the best movies on us lose inches conspiracies sense of Princeton science it's called us on TV all access us we'll be all access is now living in the Amazon ...\nApple groomed as us ... dot com and download the UN ... absolutely and I do go to us at ... dot com and subscribing now for universal access at Brussels devices that us on TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what is\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad and it looks like we're all doing trickery of some sort [noise] I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not\nYou should not ask the person who's receiving reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you ... I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed them down a gun frame by frame you can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guy's guts powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] try to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was a kid um you know was ...

strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce\n[laughter] yes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick\nWas a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking that so restrictive and limiting no into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond let's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired\nI'm monetary and other financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be and growing in a consciousness or the kind of\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah indeed now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers our listeners you're their birth month in days and all you\nHave

'cause I have so many we'll\nWe'll cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time it either on the earth or another dimension I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other a\nLot of I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious orders\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on are you picking up

person back to their\nGrave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to relate to them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that

has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school of active dreaming is original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient some Monica mystical practices for your into the rooms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including\nThree you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the author has got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood debate dreaming weaving with your George always\nLooking forward to this and would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell festival my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the receiving a and B psychic media andme of no mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned way and she saw it might that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white faced well she was right that when ... when my father had been trends that the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and help build the old my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is why do those experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything not sure what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather a living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room in that time I remember what happened that sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the feeling lucky that the the the scalpel in the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to living a pack a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride look up to go some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I don't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit\nBack adventure the opposite seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my life long on the standing\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nLike this person who could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirit and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes when nuts so the gift of these experiences with shrinks by coal dissociation\nWas the buildup to either travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are the people\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my fathers and the army's that we're moving all the time I'm Brett situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white Aaron upping face\nBecoming sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day or that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to the youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nWhere we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now or maybe radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in a dream in sleep dreams then and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survived physical death is is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the snow subconscious that sold them going on a this was the ancient an indigenous on the standing as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my including clued but loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mine but science tells us about to get in\nContact information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is anybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future\nWe can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we all said traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to the U.S tend understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience as pop the dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of St believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like but\nYou can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nHave lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell them\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple fall step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in this in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it means there's good times ... of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and both I work with the the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable I mean this is very important dreams show with\nOpportunity some challenges lie ahead they ... the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they can say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know the ... and show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death ... accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file on the other side of a\nBlind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time ... future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this become very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost the best time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the light and situations the people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we have connected to dramas being lived in other

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head thing he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on the day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and the the these examples proliferate so\n... you know ... it's how it works is that the the attitude and the energy you a caring again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking put waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life\nTo pause and check your attitude check or to play you know when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think those are good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together but when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we\nHave to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced ... maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is though they're going to throw online you living in pants\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in that it forward took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipate symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things\nWe know thing we know what the bleep we know that we know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people\nAnd we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dream I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's all the method of loose the dreaming you would call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way up and back you're going to loosen treatment venture\nIs to start out lose to the state lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance the bench is still in the stream\nLet's go on with the dream that get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror stuff the stuff going on by going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on the ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time than that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images the rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming that the method is all about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look for the outlook for signed the books in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream and felt the misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that don't think the dreams in themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around but you can pick up pigments from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own can be worked in the ... with the help of healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based\nBut by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring or worrying\nYou and your tree is the power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the step to put a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest weren't mysterious realities [noise]\nFind out more about
