I've never I mean it this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting dishes like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be fact I think states like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed\nFrom the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example that no middle ground\nIt's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument planets argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto

you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her as well it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global his\nLaw you know here you have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketing gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when and the markets were\nHad a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... up a loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but\nIt's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses anyway as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best\nTrump polls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance that's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFor forty percent we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest one was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still\nViolated but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points tomorrow now that's minor compared to fourteen hundred points over just the last\nNight stay

to your calls as well Harry within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble and the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the\nOrange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war\nAnd we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that so you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption around the world\nAnd makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said as soon as they're all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them\nThis is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming in there don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise] so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits\nAnd worked in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened

going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care\nThere on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nAnd two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well he has now I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say that but if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted to volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rambling them you\nAnd they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief\nAnd and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is Ben and it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems which forms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do if bank if governments have takes procreate money or pork how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or or sitting back and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina right now yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think yeah I guess and that's part of one of my question I asked\nA direct them I got one right way account ... why I'm not quite yet and hey how's it going to come back on line\n... yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my gardening for a moment I call it um I don't know what I heard of that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as ... as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger accounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can't insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be weightless all of all that and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course when\nWhen things go bad people gonna hit foreign depositors more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash that they can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good

or a novelist experiences visions pre cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations is well welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died from anytime\nYou know in my book the borders are my first came out many people asked me if the based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nDocuments bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that the doctors should not be paid anything told by a sense and I don't know the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and to my audience and from family and friends and some I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had somebody close how's that for many veterans that [noise] um you know\nIf you've got a lot of ... near death experience mhm\nBut the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back to occupy human moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were announced clinically dead and never had the typical near death\n[noise] but when I looked at how my clothes brushes with death affected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who has a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual\nThe first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them but then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share where I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOf this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body you\nWas it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor you about\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise]\nSo he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him the other happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they share altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed in he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab type ... that's it\nYeah just to ... to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang\nAnd then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live closer but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and what's a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she may talk to him or she might feel just touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist and nice to have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you OK but\nWhen you said that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pre cognitive beams and other things you talk to both churches visions of voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... that was just thinking about you right now is that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than the others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nAnd then you why be a\nI'm a new a new one in college and your lips are diverse teams then

about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize is paranormal phenomenon Mandy let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they don't tell you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospital\nDying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm someone who is coming to take them\nAnd they called they didn't call them and they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is it became more frequent and these are these vision print disturbing at all they were very comforting [noise]\nSo she got on the plane and sure enough that's what happened so sometimes people have these experiences have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo the as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I bring up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've read or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\n[noise] you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear\nMhm you know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nUnder there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the\nIdes of march [noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed as superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse spin on something else in Washington\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are I don't believe\nThey don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery [noise]\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors and nurses are what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the parent and on his doctors\nTie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no she was a he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right you\nHave you back but then then they said I don't know why put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words that have been used to describe the same event\nSo I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\n\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having the experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking

dance dance dance with Glen Campbell playing the lead guitar a trail would go on to become their twelve us ...\nOkay won't come back to our final hour with Dr many basis we're talking about his work the borders of normal\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices they're certain qualities that would distinguish the fake from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in\nFact they may be more than one voice too with the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations tend to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person because psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than an aside from the ... or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\nThat you played talking but in this type of thing so that it's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it has happened that is a psychologist that did it and experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be patient ahah but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take\nMedication and once they got the word the the patients me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know well\nBecause these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes well that's true but but the patients that and I think because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well they know the symptoms and everything that said\nAll right let's take some calls for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in that had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting thing that ever happened to me is when I went to London and then they go and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front\n... well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little\nAnd they were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were out in spirit that not legal and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be in\n[laughter] but you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I found the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been in the child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were hiding under the along with us canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really\nBad why I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many well\nI'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter] or the other ones where I'd been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had\nIs what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you are in that\nParticular place of knowing what all the companies thing love is\nAnd when I was during meditation or at least they can and I could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was alive light and the whole screen\nOf my vision was filled with its glittering new and different colors of orange and yellow and I could hear the voice saying this is love and I we can totally\n\nOur kids better off in an intact family you bet they are this is Joe Cordell at the domestic litigation from Cornell Cornell kids living in a house with married parents do better in school they're emotionally healthier and they're more likely to stay out of trouble with the law\nIf you're in a troubled marriage of course you should do everything you can to save your marriage if only for your kids say this includes considering alternatives to the force of course in some circumstances divorces are avoidable in either case if you're a man facing a crisis in your marriage let us help you at Cornell Cornell remember where the partner men can count on\nAll the domestic litigation from above Cordell in Cordell to schedule an appointment with one of our firms medicine attorneys a partner men can count on six zero eight two three four four zero for for six zero eight two three four four zero for four or visit online at Cordell Cordell dot com\nCordell Cordell beat zero four zero it socio Dr sweet for zero three Madison, Wisconsin five three seven one son\nThe American advertising decoration presents ad week DC an annual conference area marketing advertising in communications percussion\nBy time the most iconic granted the booming cannabis industry just went public joined the ideal now pie times you can bet\n[noise]\nDot com dome is your chance to be part of history and I'm making me did I time investor dot com that night time investor dot com I sold\nThe corps operate will be made only offering circular which has been filed with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs ...
