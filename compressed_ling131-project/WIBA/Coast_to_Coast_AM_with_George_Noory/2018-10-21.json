{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "Yeah it is insane I remember her three thousand dollars impound fees that's kind of crazy okay it's from a collection agency do you have proof that you sold the bike\nUm I\nGot I understand but you didn't you don't have proof you just did it so as far as as far as they're concerned you never transfer title okay so here you are never transferring title and ah now who would collection agency whose charging you for the impound fees\nAnd it was\nAlright it was a way that was it the city or a private company\nA man I got a ticket and then that led to a company that come out and\nThey're All right so charming company and they won three thousand dollars\nA gallon and came to mind let him keep the bike and just say a fine you know go ahead and keep it if they go after you uh you say I saw the bike years ago and the problem is they're going to ask what the proof that's why I ask you for\nPaperwork a sales I either or a sales a receipt I mean my daughter had a a very old car a that she gave to a friend of hers and up\nAnd she made sure that it was Roger certain she has the copy that his registered or you were going to say what\nThey auctioned off the bike and someone else ... records were covered after ...\nYeah because they impounded so just say no cause you sold the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but a a mark your defenses are are attacking the three thousand dollar impound feet and somehow proving\nThat you sold a biker gave it to your body and that's all you can do and maybe your buddy will testify saying yeah ah he sold the bike to me uh and I saw him registering at ... ... I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have to have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so are you defeat you obviously you jolly collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them just to you and ah then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous even a disputed is your credit already been attack\nRight yeah it probably will all our credit\nYeah probably will you gotta mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWhat my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them negotiate saying I'll give you half the money now\nI have and but the thing is I I mean it's a money more than anybody I'd rather give them the money or current\nWell then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pound sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good\nUnfortunately a not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the ... have you committed a crime yes or no\nRight it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determined here's the statute yes thirty five miles per hour is law went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff\nI loaned you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the CIA answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not\nMe there you go silver lining every moment okay\nOr Alexander Hi Alexander\nHair his or her well can I Do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at a rate the cats always shut up that from the rats showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay wait a second you oh hold on a you\nA cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so your restaurant so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYeah okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you're forgiven this much debt\nAnd die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't they sue you or they just wrote it off\nMe a original credit card company I owe Fifteen ... did did they write it off or I don't know if they ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you were that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if you\nYou can follow it a little bit better be original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean be credit card company after giving up your whiter checked the IRS\nYeah no I understand since the IRS or ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nAn ... for the amount that they said I owe\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original that fifty nine hundred I think our I kept the IRS\nYou're my credit report that showed fifty nine hundred\nDoesn't matter I don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nRather than the IRS and reduce their mind in power than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so um where my question is trying the credit card company and white at it from fifty nine and Ninety nine you I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars and it was originally in default the point is there were no ... there there are no ... but they reduced did he get\nNo not them the Ira is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up their collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no record now it's only been there done that you just done\nEven though the un like the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter they and they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nNot not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nThe question is that the credit card company and play that the original amount yes\nThey did four times over yes there is no records I guess\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you don't mean to cut out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying the two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that ah I I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no habit you paint do thousand\nOaks oh\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I

I was able to walk into the hospital so am I mean ... ... ... bass player that was such pressure on my brain darker with them or bring them mhm I could not walk I could\nNot and I was ... I'm assuming well my guess is ah you left your ah neurosurgery surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't you didn't get board\nCertified um do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out to the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems and you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I called\nYou talk ... ... well being and colleges it'll be a it'll\nBe a neurosurgeon who's making ... going to make that call when you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how about let's start with the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\nNot that I Know it's\nOkay to do what you have is you hear your damages six days of soaring and six days of walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six days of that\nWhat do you think oh it was not able to work I mean you must you must six days of work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\n\nHonestly I Know yeah I don't either so I\nI think even though there could very well have been malpractice\nI eat then there may be an argument that there wasn't we look and see a doctor could have easily miss that I that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical exemptions here\nThat uh you or I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions\nAnd it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon who's payoff will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work you see the problem\nRight but the attorney to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problems as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that would cause the long term problem\nYeah okay and you know that for a fact that doctors have told you I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy I'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct\nAll right so six days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks she'd be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the gym or six days before\nOkay so I well doctor and a ... where where\nWas your residency in neurosurgery let's go through that because we have to put you on the stand and do we have to absolutely a approved the court that you have the certifications that you have the credentials as an expert so let's start with ... uh where did you go medical school\nOh outlook\nOkay how about your residency of neurosurgery little court are and how many are\nAnd how long have you been a neurosurgeon 'cause you want to do this for years and years and ordered yeah credibility correct exactly okay\nWhy don't we take a break on that one what do you think [noise]\nThis is handling the law [noise]\nBackyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a duck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask comb advice on what home advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice well how much does it cost\nHome advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor at [noise]\nAre you considering a safe or gun safe districts your your valuables and firearms\nIf so before you spend any money on any typical run a mental shape check out the amazing I Am crafted rhino iron works shapes and rhino safe dot com she for yourself why Ronald shaped customers are so passionate about their ... and if you're a gun owner you'll love the convenience of those swing I've done wreck\nRhino has a huge deal or network great pricing warranty in customer service so go to rhino\nSafe dot com today ... safe dot com\nMessaging to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that\nDegree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more\nTax scale to seven nine six four or five\nThat's S.

to have the same clients\n[noise] [noise] no I I think on on my car\nOkay so so when you got a ticket for not having your sticker on the license plate or they ticketed you for not having your sticker on your license plate even though you put it on you say\nYes I Am the only way I wasn't aware\nOf what was so and I don't understand the sticker was stolen from whom by whom\nThink I'm gonna have to do it from the license plate\nOh I weigh one took the sticker off your license plate\nOr I don't play yeah okay\nGot it and that was confusing as health thank our cleaning that one up for me oh God limited time limit time okay and the court just didn't believe it because you didn't put a police report right\nYeah okay with it of course I didn't I wasn't I think that I Am now what what's your question\nAlso also and different to their response was that they took a picture of the like a play on a ... they said that while she would have not afraid we'll put it that All right what's your so what's your question\nLike question as she either pole and forget about what I yeah I mean what how much is a ticket for like a little couple of dollars are\nGoing to be a lot when I hear you you\nGo to court I Would just pay it by ... you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge you to go your honor here's what happened a B C and D and uh they said we should have filed a police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker\nOn a license plate because once I put the stick around the license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nLike protect every day\nYeah exactly I think it's a I think paying it's a different these in defense a shirt tell it to a judge 'cause worse that happens you have to pay for the chicken anyway yeah\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most in Shane defenses you've ever seen\nAnd and the fun one where\nAh the people come up and they said you'll see with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or not so whenever you see someone guilty when the next when they are depending on the judge or if the judge allows a person to explain just to get it off his or her chest the ... the judges eyes roll which is always kind of fun or the judge will say\nWho cares\nYou know explain it to your pet rock while or because I don't want to hear it so I Would go down to try it why not I think if you look at it I mean it's it's certainly as why don't you go what you're saying\nHi Stephen you're up welcome good morning Yes sir\nHe built up at a question about employment ah I signed on with the company back on the two thousand and part of my original shop off or wish that I Would be entitled to a bar of a minimum of ten thousand dollars per year\nAh they pay the ... the first six or seven years and then not when the economy hit the skin like a two thousand they\nUh they continued not to pay me that bonus for a total of nine years\nI left the company last year and I'm Wondering if I have a case to go back and and take a little fun\nRight so here's the question right they breach the contract or by not\nPaying you a bonus of a minimum of ten thousand years or ten thousand dollars a year which incidentally uh there was nothing in the contract that said no matter whether they make money or not or the ... the economy\nI Know you'll get your ten thousand right that's right\nAll right so they haven't paid you for nine years in particular reason you waited nine years to not get paid\n... spoke to him about it and they basically said well you know our economy here\n... knowing I understand that match and so that's the reason now I can understand that for four years when the economy change right I get that right but after four\nYears ah you're still looking at five ... years of the economy doing much better\nAnd to the point where the economy has become has gotten on fire and it has exploded for the last couple of three years\nAnd why have you didn't you go in there say hey guys I didn't because the economy was really crap during the recession but now that it's doing great and that everybody's making money how about a check you didn't do that\nI did that bill and then I bought the house he bought my salary and a little bit but he didn't pay any bonuses\n... so you accepted uh the salary bumping then go after the bonus yeah\nAll right so now a let me give you a fun I'm a fun legal aspect and it's called a stop all\nWaiver and stop all that's yes T. O. P. P. E. L. stop all which is a fun way of I guess the Italians say stop to stop all it is a legal doctrine that says even if you do have a case\nIf you will elect not to go forward and argue your breach\nYou accepted that and that's the argument they're going to make you have accepted the fact that they're not going to pay you a bonus\nNow uh can you go back you're not going to go back nine years I guarantee you that ah can you go back uh maybe but they're going to keep on arguing I Would saying hey you know what yeah we had a deal but we weren't dealing with it and he's obviously he's OK with it\nSo um you can talk to a lawyer how many\nThe bonus shot ten thousand dollars by the way at least ten thousand dollars is very interesting uh but let's say the only be liable if there's liability for ten grand and that's over Ninety Ninety thousand dollars you know we're talking\nTo a lawyer so talked to a lawyer and we'll see how far how far it goes in hello and welcome\nYes ma'am I had found a way and he was twelve years older than my bell and when we got married had gone to an orange and\nWhatever whatever it is fine but I put everything in her name they launched shortly when you went to Germany and the and the attorney Megan area\nDid he tell you why my husband know from an organization and it was the good old boy\nI don't know knowing that doesn't make any sense oh what can\nI think he was going to take my ... everything and not let your children and what he had bad yeah\nOK well back a long story short I have to wait no problem that we know how to do what you wind up with it and I'll do what I Want what the other\nOkay that's after they die you said that\nHoney or you\nDie said that I'm a little confused here okay alright college I don't know what I Want to write so he took twenty five percent of the state and did what we look\nAt it in my family I\nKnow a lot you know kill or how did he leave it to your side of the family\nThat funny I got\nWhat instrument did he used to leave it\nUm I don't trust\nSo you do it so very vocal trust right in\nYeah OK well perhaps alright okay\nAll right so uh what's your question about the euro vocal part of their trust\nHe left my

average nine hundred thousand people disappear every year in the United states alone this does not include\nThose that are not reported or Americans have disappeared abroad that's just our country worldwide and the million and most of the people who disappear to show up sooner or later I mean people disappear for different reasons they get abducted their murdered\nOr they think they want to start a new life for home life is just too terrible to want to stay there anymore even fill that still have thousands and thousands who simply vanished for good\nAnd also there's another way you can disappear it can be murdered and my book deals with that and the actual disappeared themselves because they seem to be an awful lot of ... um\n[noise] you know research research that had been murdered

is shut the shelter lift that he got ... ... but the show the focus quite real so it's a problem\nWhere it's a huge problem or indeed what do you think is happening to them were were they going what are they doing with him\nWell if you're speaking of the ones that actually disappear completely in forever yeah and they never come back right there there are being taken this on purpose or if you go by the abductions it could be for experiment although abductees usually come back a but the other disappeared permanently\nThey must have some long term purpose for them and that's frightening possibility because the truth is they simply don't know what that is but it doesn't sound like it's a good\nThing you know the the food\n[noise] well there is one theory that they are food and uh but I Would find that\nIn a theory I mean yeah ...\nIt's possible I went into ... disappears it does make you wonder if they aren't cattle fodder for the Malian ... when they go ahead of the way to take people off of her front porch\nA as they did with the crippled man back in Seventy sixty three just disappeared completely never came back and he couldn't move under his own power or things like it it makes you wonder because you really go either way to ... the one person or a barbeque [noise]\nSo there has to be some other purpose what that purposes is\nProbably not a good one I suspect it\nMay be for a fitting that experimentation and maybe a body part [noise] or it could be forced labor they may have a population declined going on and they made needy slave labor\nPopulation pitch in ... um if you look at western civilizations every country that becomes industrialized population begins to fall in any way you can maintain is by immigration\nJapan's a good example this they don't have immigration their population is in is really crashing Russia's as crashing ours would be crashing if we didn't have immigration here so yes they can be slaves that could be any number of things\nI I think there's something very serious going on it's just either they're eating them or they're doing something now you know if they needed our DNA for example they held their civilizations\nYou know what they could come here make themselves known people would volunteer to help\nOr maybe maybe not I'm sure that would be something that I'm sure that would be something that wouldn't um they may be used for multiple purposes I mean yes it could\nBe used for food they could be from body parts or they can be nice Oregon banks or maybe that's why they might be trying to ... to be more like them\nSo that part's match better more genetically ...\nThey started on channel mutilation so now they moved up to wash\nExactly uh but it does seem strange that I mean they do from to pick on people that are isolated like the Clinton or aisles are disappearing or the to lead housekeepers or they just vantage tell me that she [laughter]\nWell it it happened in Nineteen hundred uh there were two housekeepers are managing a a station on a rock basically and they just suddenly vantage twin the or the relief came they didn't find them they found the closer food everything they didn't find them\nThey official explanation was they must have been swept away by a freak wave but further investigation showed clearly know freak wave could reach as high as where they would have been further ... both then wouldn't have left the White House at one through was once stayed one went out but you didn't have to together\nAnd evidence seems to show that they didn't go out together one did one didn't because of a missing rain gear so no one knows what happens from they've just absolutely vanished never found bodies and ever traced nothing\nYou've got the Bennington Triangle in Vermont between Nineteen twenty Nineteen fifty people kept disappearing they're one right off of a bus or it just it it goes on and on and on people just vanished here there and everywhere and they're never seen again no trace of them\nSometimes the clothing just left behind in the case of the uh the crippled man back in the Seventeen hundreds of but no sign of him there's no way he could have made it often is on the left them on the porch went out to get him later on and he was\nGone he's gone with is is ... is there but he was gone Nineteen Seventy five\nJackson writes in a a Lincoln tunnel in New York a condensation builds up his windshield they pull out of the time he pulls over his wife goes out to wipe it off she disappears never seen again nothing\nJust like that\nJust like that people and both parents are very famous person disappeared in Nineteen Thirteen December twenty six he was American editorialists a journalist and oddly he wrote a story about a man disappearing by walking across the field and witnesses seeing him simply disappear the story was fiction but then he disappeared no trace of him as ever been found\nNo what if these people are merely walking through some of the time warp and gone and they just can't get back\nWell that is one theory that may have been a time warp and maybe a dimensional wore a an issue here is\n... and ... and the fabric of space time yeah it's it's it's definitely possible but if you go by the number of disappearances [noise]\nAh there must be an awful lot of those terrorists and the fabric of space time and it must be everywhere around the planet which is possible but also you must have been cited in some cases with regard to these disappearances with the disappearance of the Chinese village\nIn um a China are\nYou telling me about that story\nOkay well this supposedly happened background than twenty ten and with the Chinese village it was in the ... forgive my pronunciation of of of the Chinese name or the ... mountains in the ... province and a ... had been cited there and then all of a sudden\nThe rumors started that an entire village of people that simply disappeared not the village but the people are witnesses said that the roads and the freeway near the village area or had military on it that uh there were tanks missiles transport vehicles covered with canvas some people think that might have been might have been a nuclear\nAccident there's a nuclear power plant near there but that wouldn't account for them bringing in military forces with missiles and tanks just doesn't make sense they disappeared and supposedly have never been found they're not the only ones who was a Canadian village Nineteen thirty that the population disappeared or\nHow many people they\nAre the accounts vary that something was thirty men or women and children other stay with as many as two thousand\nGone\nGone just vanished a another strange thing is it looked like several dogs had been chained up and has starved to death and yet\nWhen the first person who happened to the scene and Joel the bell he found fires still burning the amber is still there half cooked food burned in the pods as if they had just left there was no sign of anyone they left everything behind and the people were never found again\nThis was the an ad and Jacuzzi village\nIn the um who was the last ... village right\nIt was an ... yeah in a way maybe I might they might be called now but Ah yes and they um they simply couldn't find them they couldn't find anything they just completely gone and had left everything behind and oh by the way there is also varying accounts of the graves when it counts as one grave with Doug up\nAnd about who disappeared in Oakland said all the groups have been dug up and the students have been stacked into piles and yet the ground was frozen solid they\nWere there any reports of beautiful activity prior to these disappearances\nA searchers said that they noticed strange blue lights on the horizon one night and that these clearly were not the ... the northern lights they don't know what they were mounted supposedly also investigated this incident they went there are several hours later after ... had come back and it was his tail and telegraph\nThem and um they couldn't find anything either a one one mounted\nDid claimed to have seen an illuminated excuse me illuminated flying thing as he called it it was cylinder shaped a\nDisappearance is\nA this was after the disappearance while he was in the area searching after all and shortly after hours later\nWell you know no coincidence is so strange that crap would be in the area before or after\nSo many of the policies are safe and we see that whether it's Obama or George Bush wherever it is that they pursue fairly similar strategies and

which you can find a link up at coast to coast damn dot com let me read a little bit about the ... pass incident for everybody\nThe Diablo pass incident was an event that resulted in the death of nine ... years north of the Ural Mountains such in Russia on the night of February second to Nineteen fifty nine the incident happened on the eastern side of an area called cannot Shaquille\nWhose name is ... ... dead since then the mountain pass where the incident occurred is called the diet bluff past based on the name of the group's leader Gore\nDiet the absence of witnesses and the subsequent investigations concerning the debts the skiers inspired intense speculation\nInvestigators determine that the skiers toward their tent inside out\nLean on foot under heavy snow fall some without shoes although the bodies showed no signs of struggle to victims set fractured skull should too broken ribs Soviet authorities determined that an unknown compelling force\nThat caused the deaths access to the region was consequently blocked for hikers and adventurers for up to three years after the incident due to the lack of survivors the chronology of a bench remains on certain\nRob a bizarre story\nAn incredible story actually interpreting what did you investigated\nYes I did I went into some detail and I look at all the possible answers in detail and I think the only possible answer really if you vote I Know the Edie Henry with ... a prominent for a while but yeah\nIt doesn't seem to support that why would people in sub zero weather be intense without shoes on orange socks and then when they ran the when when they fled they fled in their beer feet or what's one sock on or something like that\nYes and they had all their winter weather here in the tent with them it would have been nothing to snatch up one of them actually ran out with his camera but not as close\nSome see a made them want to run and run so it wasn't just\nThat they didn't run out the entrance of the ten they clawed their way or cut their way through the sides of the tent that they were in such a panic to get out\nTo get on with their sense yeah\nYeah and and apparently they couldn't go out the anthrax so they went out another way and they literally ran to the snow or several refined than a ravine with ... with us you were talking about I'm also one woman had her tongue\nPulled out was or is that what does that remind you of anything like the animal mutilation\nExactly there was one person who left earlier she went back he wasn't feeling well or his name was Judy you didn't and he died just a few years ago\nOn but most of them were dressed were barely anything on\nThey ran in ... where you know normally when you sleep like that in sleeping bags especially at that time you didn't wear clothing uh was actually better not to if you were in the sleeping bags and that sort of thing [noise] kept your warmers so they were to the state of undress when it happened and they didn't take time to address nor did they go back to address one man was only in his underwear now they try to account for that\nBy saying that well if you have hypothermia and twenty five percent of cases you actually can feel too hot your body is giving a misreading\nOf your pocket close it doesn't explain the other people state of undress and why they didn't go back and get dressed it doesn't explain how they died and why they died it doesn't explain and they also come to die in two separate locations\nAnd the tongue being torn out is very strange they wanted to say well it was animals but again it doesn't look as if an animal in it\nThan some of them had fractures others did not\nAnd others did not and yet none of them seem to have the hemorrhaging or bruising one would associate with something that would cause which has to have cracked ribs\nOne of the Soviets the Russians what did they say\nWell the Russians that their answer a compelling force of nature they simply don't know they closed the case of ... at first they were examining it very carefully but then suddenly they just slammed the lid on it and that was it\nFor years didn't they are also a makes the the files so private\nOh the the the files were locked up during the entire time of the Soviet Empire it wasn't until after the fall that filed finally became available [noise] uh I mean it was absolutely sealed it was considered top secret and nothing was said about it you know frankly if they'd been one of their ICBM missiles or something like that\nProbably the uh why not just said there was a a test mishap and they were victims of the test that isn't true\nUm they would have been alone stretch so\nThey would have been blown to shreds or I mean it it and nothing crashed into the time and they haven't crashed right near them yes there were pieces of metal found and yes there was radioactivity on some of their clothing but not all that I mean how does one explain those\nShould be all or not\nIt shouldn't be or not right either you're irradiated or you or not but ah so ah ... there's the question so\nWay out number the answer and the only conclusion I can come to personally since none of the other explanation seem adequate [noise] is that something strange is going on there and it was probably extraterrestrial nature yeah for the more I think that area has separate from this for a very long time you have a mountain called mountain of the dead are dead mountain\nYou had the area that they were tracking to to get there called don't go there and the native local tribe and by the way this isn't the only place like that there are the places in the Siberian area where they have these um middle\nHalf a context um objects like a half domes and wherever they are nothing grows and people are warned us not to go near them because they will kill you and\nThose areas are named the same and those things have been there so long that the local tribes people have named one of the rivers was named for one of these things called they called them\nCome do they do talk about this case in Russia\n[noise] uh yes they do talk about it of course it's like here they don't talk about it officially but there is a a Fishell a museum and said I don't want even tried to pronounce the name but ah they have one and they are trying to um\nCome up with more information but they have whatever information they have is that the museum that they have access to and yes there are people still talking about people still investigating\nCatherine thank you that's a really high and that's where the foundation is right\nYeah yes it is yes and ah they they have a Memorial Day or two the nine of them so ah but to a Russian is difficult for me to pronounce that can do the Greek and Latin but the Russians typical for me\nYet you know\nI Know devout it's true and that's about it\n... or does well done yeah\nThose are the on yeah I Know that one as well and that's it that's my Russian so uh and of course or even the name you know do you pronounce that diet love ... love but ah yeah this is an interesting case and\nAgain Russia seems to have a long history of this especially in that region when you're a native tribes people are naming regions as dead mountain don't go there cauldron river\nIs a place of the dead this is not good [laughter] the fare\nWell in this little Canadian area that these people disappear that's fascinating too\nAnd it's very similar in a way isn't it except that you didn't find anybody they just completely vanished [noise] uh and and and it's strange because\nOne can only conclude that somehow without any proper clothing or weapons or supplies food water or whatever [noise] ah they managed to walk so far away that no one ever found\nYet what those citizens of Bruno colony remember that back in the Fifteen hundreds yeah they're missing teen eighty seven and they all thirty men and women and children vanished without a trace\nIncluding Virginia there yeah there's going\nTo end the only thing they found that might have a pertain to it is the word ... carved into a tree\nThe bark of the tree that's all they know and these people were never found again no trace of them or their belongings that they might have had with them wherever found nobody's no skeleton nothing they simply and utterly vanished [noise] so if the loss colony of Virginia Roanoke Rowan Oak island so\nWell and and obviously the fishing village this newest fishing village in Canada were all these people disappeared um something something's not right\nNow again and and and of course in my books that costs\nGoing on because something is going on\nNow it's ...\nAnd here's this ... the machine and missing Malaysia place plane are reselling lots of conclusions I'm writing a for a day but we're you know Richard elder comes out next month this matter of fact strongly Spanish but we kicked around various theories\nAnd you know watch something may have taken that to\nTo\nTrain it repealed\nDisappear let's take some calls Robin we come back and just a moment the phone call about the ADL or people who are simply to\nFind out more about tonight to log on to go to the coast am dot com\nIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEight hundred eight eight by twenty six hundred eight hundred eight eight by twenty six hundred\nEight hundred eight eight five to six zero zero [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOf everything you've investigated today Rob what is that one story that just sticks out in your mind is that the ... past what is it\nYes it is that one because the strangest used the term is are a lot when referring to that well yes you're absolutely\nRight it is the only turn that really fits that\nEven if it is an extraterrestrial even if it scared the heck I had to flee for the live what followed them in what killed them and why and how did it manage it they don't even know how they died this film hypothermia [noise]\nThe crack rich enough to kill the skull fracture wasn't enough to kill them with a bruise that are attendant with a crack rehab there weren't any but yeah that to me is probably stranger\nSomething's going on I mean this is a big planet it's a huge universe is there's so much going on\nBut when you think of genesis and you hear the story of the fallen angel ... do you tie in these extraterrestrials ... do you think that's possibly what they were talking about\nYes I Do and I do believe the uh [noise] there was one of them that was probably like for me it is because he appears\nRepeatedly throughout history and different forums if the guy to give us fire\nA serpent and the guard I mean what gave us the tree of knowledge and with punished for it repeatedly you have this this apparently were oh God if you want to call them that are extraterrestrial who hated us and was punished eternally for having\nDone that so yeah I Do think that definitely it dates back at the time of genesis\nAll right let's go to the polls now we'll go to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to get things wrong with Pete Pete or sorry about your Steelers but you're on the air\nNo problem we have the super bowl championship will be okay [laughter] oh sure your\nAh your guest tonight amazing and I want to come from everything that you believe in about the moon the alien then the ... the blue light cetera because it happened the may\nUh ten years ago I'd say in about twenty to thirty blue UFO do around the moon\nAnd that something might happen where they had to evacuate for a short period but I was one of the fortunate ones that say that about a month later I was confronted by which were dark and it said about three of them\nCould be aliens could be demonic because they were truly negative at you that they are\nThey attacked the may they tortured me I went through the process I even touch them they were trying to touch my kid need my liver I grab whatever they are at hand and I fought back I Want to know from you\nI did I Survived this that's what I've always was guy I said I Am with God and when I said that they talked into demonic voice and they said you know nothing about God and they were very insulted that I use that that I was\nLike why did I Survived and how did you get out of it you know what I mean did they leave you or did you run away from my room\nUm a lot of people talk about the black antipathy because it's so common they left my room\nThere were three of them they saw me looking at them leaving that offended them two of them laugh the other one went from about three and a half feet tall too about eight foot tall to intimidate me and I feel like a little kid\nWhat are you thinking about when Rob\nI think it's pretty terrible I'm Wondering do separate from any sort of post traumatic stress disorder as a result of all of this\nAfter all my research over the years I Would believe that my health I declined slightly the anxiety level is much higher but at the same time I have seen more UFOs I have seen balls of electricity the orange spheres\nI think I'm more in touch with that element now but why did I survive why why wasn't I ripped apart why wasn't I take it and why did I make it through\nWell my personal answer to that would be just lucky\nWhere we had some kind of guiding hand or help involved in some way either way it boils down to you're very lucky because a lot of people don't ah maybe there was something about you maybe this thing about your behavior or\nMaybe the maybe he's scared them\nThat could be maybe his attitude and behavior toys that was enough to make them decided to go somewhere else you know when people Rob homes they look for the easiest home to Rob not the ones with alarms\nOr going to be so that's right\nYeah so maybe he just decided to go elsewhere\nMatched up we go to rich in Los Angeles now hey Richard turn go ahead\nWonderful which ought to be on your show Jordan thank you\nUh yeah I was I was wondering about the plows Seventeen or the NASA photographs because like photographs with like a robot heads\nAnd like turkey machines that can combustion engines and you don't share the NASA photographs and um I always worry about that and then they had like a um\nSome people say that's why they they say that the moon missions or state because um [noise] it's like suddenly doctored the photos to like show people back on earth what the astronaut saw so\nI'm like a wonder like you know\nWhat do you think about all that\nWhat you're asking me I think that's what you're right I don't think that the NASA mission faked a we have too much evidence to show that it didn't I mean we weren't the only ones tracking the radio signals from that\nAre from those ships every country on earth with including the Soviets at the time and believe me if we had been faking it they would have now and\nAlso they are left asked myself things on the moon including the size and the graphs and things that we're still using to this day and a device that we can shoot him off to measure the distance from the earth to the moon and we know that the moon is getting a little further away as a result\nSo there's a lot of evidence to show that we actually did go there on a number of occasions where there in person [laughter]\nUm but I Do think that Dr King a picture is I think the evidence for that is overwhelming\nThere's a photograph from the ... Seventeen that's like it was wide it out the official NASA explanation but when you contrast that you see a pyramid\nAnd like the the contrast photo and you know so so you know I guess they had to people just couldn't accept it and they had a doctorate that used to the robot head of the little photo Rob I haven't seen the robot\nHad it looks like it looks like little ... pizzeria on something like that yeah\nWe do with like with like lipstick or whatever and then if you look at the outline you see the hit and it looks like the body exploded and I heard on the actual transmission from NASA on that flight\nThat they were in that they they are in the car and then they they were looking at this wreckage are like ... it was created with like orange color that's where they went to check it out for and then when they were looking at it they're like they turn they turn up the box or whatever it was\nAnd they're saying they they're like they're like whoa you know this is pretty bizarre stuff and then uh you know so that was it was a Buzz Aldrin he's the one that said that there is you know extra terrestrial life doesn't you know this or that guy like either he's old on either each crazy\nOr or order [laughter]\nI Love it and all you're going to do Rob Google Richard hold wound H. O. H. G.

the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind which is run by the SBC see\nGraham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the months for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful\nWelcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we describe this I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for\nThese people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him\nBut I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from\nThis guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know fake medium would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini and they pull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled or psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah\nThis writing on beating on Harry right about\nThat my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone call hey you know I mean so that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't add any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right which is I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive a the fact that area was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a and defining in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talk about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that\nGot so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she

discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nYears after this and he was in a really bad car accident he was with his to stir eyes car accident\nAnd his healing processes hated by painkillers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted them more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yes yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a stay on for pike now pikes son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret history is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a ... a a I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe okay that\nArea it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say that [laughter]\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the stance in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do the same answers high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nUm\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're\nInclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was ... she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nCheer 'em and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere in trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick the prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake tell all the last debate because of my

[laughter] it's not worth leaving it all makes them they were asked to go so far right\nNow in the case of FDR um you know this is [laughter] Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of the century and he was it or was it difficult at this stage in the game to to reopen this very very cold case\nThey're always difficult because I never want to know that there's a germ seed inside all of us like truth justice and you're not in a way and you don't want to think of anything sinister is going on a you know behind your back and so so they're all they're all\nThey're all I just I just mean finding the documents I'm Sorry say again\nI I just mean finding the documents or uncovering the the the real facts of the case after all this time\nWell what I did as a I went through those about mansion in upstate when Hyde Park New York which was a terrific place we have a chance to go and spend an hour or ... what\nA beautiful place in the Roosevelt mansions on your around all her overhead is the national archives\nShow I just want a tremendous amount of on the last ... or ... when we can use it with top secret previously\nAnd they're huge files there on the hour and a his wife Eleanor ... there's that's where you are filing cabinet right in the middle or the animal's struggle over actually that and I want to Roosevelt\nAnd actually the economy those when she was being investigated being investigated for being a comment so you know who you will never had that information years ago you know\nSo that's where the majority everyone promotional came from is from the original documents and I'm turned out to be a bit of what it was a great expires robbing people the wrong way\nI think everybody rubs some of the wrong way for doing something you know I don't really young I mean listen all\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes things [noise] um but you it needs to say\nYou don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned\nA communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalinist Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about\nA young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth a\nPaint me I'm a ... a portrait of a young FDR\n... you know yeah I was a I like I Would say he was beneficiary of the ... experiment well this guy\nWas born in any way\nWho [laughter] you know I mean there's ... they were just sitting in the news was old world well I mean there are only groundwork quarter mile down the road is the Vanderbilt match up\nThere on the same basic parcel of land I mean to say that this guy was ... and ... and had every single thing that we have which are over desired was an understatement um you know ... anyone people at nothing so\nUm he was a when I was ... was out around\nWith not establish student um sees all the way through school or you'd rather loop off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a ... and here's what was it I Want to use but he was a it was something was earlier and I was actually something\nI think that anyone was there for the ashtray\nHis political where it started out with the loss of Maine and seeing how the ... and they blossom them being the owner of you are a\nLot of people don't know what I was governor of New York after they forgot or they're just not talking about it any more or less you know he was ... the main now he just talked to him [laughter] older Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt biter Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got\nHit a change of the monitor grammar and part of life actually\n[laughter] no\nUm no I mean this is the evolution of the good person\nShould at least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was he a second or third cousin\nThinking it was a second ago right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\n\nThey got along really well I'm actually are stopping it wasn't too thrilled about what he does that let's just not the way but he was raised by that Roosevelt name off that was done anything differently if he was\nA ... a bowl on their special and like oh that's so\nA lot of things without unsavory ban some yourself marrying that's going on and they move in a number of tight rose up you know that name but it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the law as well\nAnd as well so right and he was also the governor of New York classic no he was he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through the history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have a\n... sort of I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy sock seem Kmart back in the er the member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks that k-mart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they live amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the printing and people who just the ... and they don't have any idea about us or what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's a ...\n[laughter] thank you so much on the phone with a loaded word\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days what you're seeing is being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nAbsolutely um it it's just a short\nChanged debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march ... children\nSo\nWe have been going back to watch over Ninety three which meant that rules or at a week or so this mystery under which don't judge or a hundred [noise] um [noise] I think those are all\nRighty at a forum had a four month a head start a list that will take a timeout will come back Steve and talk

your just to Richard Sayre is that's a pretty\nVersion of across the universe David Bowie [noise]\nI'm here to tell you folks are maps are all wrong all of the wrong and a a a scientist has created a representation of what the world really looks like\nA true map of the world and you can check it out it's a posted in the in the news section of the coast to coast am dot com or webmaster shot a store a tonight is all over that and he's a posted that there are many countries for example including Russia and Canada are are not nearly as big as we think\nAnd the problem is it's very difficult to portray the reality of a sphere or co world on a flat map and so you get this distortion\nIt's called their Mercator projection map\nOr the most commonly seen hanging in classrooms in textbooks it was created back in Fifteen Ninety six I think it's maybe time we have to wait and see what was it was designed to help sailors navigate the world the ... the Mercator projection buddy distorts seriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nMap also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India\nWhereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nLooks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is true Russia isn't as large as its depicted with Africa larger than Russia in reality\nSo if you want to see the world is it really is represented on a map\nYou want to check out this

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to get the last\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed and night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes and the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff\nSo um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way I'm anyway are we going into the war and we're we don't have anything to do with stolen at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing her island they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in weight on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the British\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course the two at my previously and I'm sure she really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because\nThey were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um church elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trust that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we\nWeren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about rape purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been history but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... million\nFDR it seemed a ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with style and I don't know if this was because he admired him or but that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us\nWe need it's balanced island in the U.S he was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack well ill or violated the pack and went after style in which completely\nSilence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable\nIt's completely unstoppable so of\nCourse we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and Hillary says well I don't\nCare I Want to go do it so styling is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a restaurant in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA skill at this point you know I I think she's Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know my my standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit Hemingway you\nAdd loudly so it was a fictitious pound it didn't exist that was made it hurt word basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sent all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their archery maybe our country into this one little new ideology they didn't know what you're talking about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in history going by stone stone is the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy when he managed to accomplish with his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the Bolshevik Revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of stone\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party journals are used to call them\nUm ribs or was it ... hundred index card it was to re we're used to make fun of them because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one knocked off every one of the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible ... what a what a ruthless maybe we'll maniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that it is a quote from one of those will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after ... death they they called him a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson it get taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who murdered FDR stay with us here in

I Believe in the seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this new information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my playing the idea that the pond originally made their money to the ... trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and a rocket that law uh\nStarted out lighting novels with kerosene but boy that combat stumble engine that kind of a ... like a byproduct than they can End Days ran down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mentioned mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to actually are quote unquote it takes a trip to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's old money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very well the east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I haven't heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what\nIf I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nBy the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach her name to wants to be as best they can you know

Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry who d'nese um how should we practice I mean he was\nNot just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all taking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think is ultimately got him killed because I ...\nThat the people these fake psychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um\nThat young student who had been on the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I Would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from\nThis guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh hell he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would\nFind a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know we say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and and uh you know the\nFake media wouldn't be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah\nThis writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems that makes sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right\nI thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circle sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a door oil was a prominent spiritual is so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... and ... in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talk about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that\nGot so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nOne of the last things he
