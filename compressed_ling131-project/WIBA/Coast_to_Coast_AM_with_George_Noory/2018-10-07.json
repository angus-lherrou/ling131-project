[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWill is here on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love so uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um\nInvestigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talked about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabbed her ... somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean I I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... from the conservative cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient the health I mean they they they they they worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they\n... if if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is coming to a team\nYou know ... not suffer which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a where'd you born or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the\nThe owners were so concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic polls whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nWill know about what it said what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the room you know sign this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know\nAdults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... motion that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that bill have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and they're like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest events like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was the wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrowed mine either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nThey were great under you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stopped because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I'm going to go after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face a lot fewer McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I Would probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nMember on all the producers were were watching that so I say hey you guys are going on there now\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff now another element\nAnd some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nThe biggest music festival of a year and it's coming to their CWC\nI already are using\nDon't miss the comic performance if\n[noise]\nAre you a man facing divorce if so listen carefully divorce affects all areas of your life financially emotionally and mentally it changes the relationship with your children\nPerhaps even more than you think my name is Joe ... and I know how hard divorces because I've been there myself are from work hard to protect the interests of man during the process we represent men like you want to protect their financial interests and the relationship that the air but their kid everyone involved in a divorce has affected by the breakup of the family\nCourt Alan ... try to help you through this tough time so that then you can move on with your life\nCall the domestic litigation for of course Dylan Cordell to schedule an appointment with one of our firms medicine attorneys ordinary men can count on six zero eight two three four four zero for for six zero eight two three four\nFour zero for four or visit online at Cordell Cordell dot com Cordell Cordell eight zero four zero it socio Dr sweet for zero three Madison, Wisconsin five three seven one son\n[noise] you know one [noise]\nAnd my wife [noise]\nShe [noise]\n\nMm\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nI Know we [noise]\n[noise] man\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nDo use coast to coast am now here's your guest host ...\nSuch cranberries\nAnd zombies on the coast to coast am tiny well let's hear on the wheel is would we knew oh\nMan I don't like hearing that when it's dark blue [noise]\n[noise] I shouldn't let a candle or something nice in them and spooky more a great spooky stuff to come here of course and by the way\nI Want to remind you of our annual goes to go shell that we will have here on Halloween Night on coast to coast that's a Wednesday night by the way October thirty first okay send us your best go story and we just might choose used to tell it live on coast to coast\nThat is so fun George nobody gets all the good shows darn it [laughter] it it's a you know I think this was a fun night so email your name your phone number and your best\nGo story to Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com give us your best stuff\nAnd if we like it then you get to tell it on the air was your story that I Love this it's an annual thing that we do it goes to show instead of coast to coast\nSo fun it's so fun so if you need more ... forgotten about that if you think oh I I'm kind of like you know it's late I'm not going to remember this I don't have anywhere write it down simply tomorrow I'll go back to our website and there's the information it's coast to coast A.

A.\n\n[noise]\nCoast to coast am Connie Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we're talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghosts and it's um\nSound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing audio waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we were all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghost because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... feel detectors\nAnd the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation but ... but there's no one has ever proved that you know that a location with high E. M. F. um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or\nA who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nIn ghost hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think coach awesome and if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one reason why I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know um I I don't know it goes or I mean that's that's a that's a million dollar question right I mean you even even among the the grossed hundreds unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nThen you know with some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and treat the the three played other people think that goes in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit of the day that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions\nIs problematic for ghost research right because\nGoats can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know a a an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I don't know what ghosts\nAre obviously they're not they have ... Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual but that that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for keeping his information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up we're going to be talking they werewolf in London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin 'cause all Sinclair he somebody you want to me out in the case and

on the left over the head ... he said\nHe thought he was a young hopes he meant halls so HBO the blessing 'cause I thought one of your ...\nSuccumb believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small town it or you you know your horse he said the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just let him that he said wait expects a horse to lend to move

well there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's not a lot of money and [laughter] right [laughter] and crow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not\nExactly you know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of a magazine a couple of inquire new things like that but I Am but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking focal point of view\nAnd so one so part of the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at ghosts again\nAll right you know they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so\nThat that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and

of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is an led goblins\nAnd and the theory bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think
