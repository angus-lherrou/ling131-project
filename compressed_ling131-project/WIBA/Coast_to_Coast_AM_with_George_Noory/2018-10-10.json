Eckhart\nTotally much cheaper you know wash 'em and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo would science back us up\nTo my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine where I talk about near death experiences [noise]\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just to hold his nation that happens when someone about to die like a evolutionary mechanism that allow people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched\nType of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all and even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am

work in into upside down thinking\nMarch ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise some\nGreat question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell like a cycle couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show video tapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired\nI I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work now psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote Ewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is\nPeople to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more want to hear us again what do we find is that there is a mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people that people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those mere perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the prison study where these machine the random number generators\nWere set up around the world that people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experimenter had done it looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event\nThat we know a producer heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a hunting trip basically at at at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone the focus their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the event\nWhat do we find that there was a bike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now

I've heard of of food and bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller back then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending within the context of remote viewing bellies and what they say in the direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo\nYou know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name mark over and they are K G.

this to move a little bit but thank lunchtime early afternoon when landfall will be going into a really become a reality flex\nYeah I'm Glad you brought up short they're really really important one because if if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was an Asian perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically don't even our eyes\nI I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest study is where people have their in cardiac arrest ... hate it and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to see it after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple Dr ... and ... from Stony Brook neither one we'll scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in\nYeah can rest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets than the area\nYou can't see those radio signals butts they're out there is that a little bit when we're dishes like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes Shoah a small sliver\nOf the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes\nI Am a rational atheist and immaterial west however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease and uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the Andy is now heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically a I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nFact chemically the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches but going back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively [laughter]\nThe mine that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain or does it affect the conscious is The Mind's a dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's type medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we\nCan't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise] imagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness\nYou damage the brain you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a\nFiltering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen ... what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nI'm In er sometimes there are five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nSo it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence\nAnd other ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for

there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work in my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on ... with water which\nIn yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then see the drillers calm and drill right to that same ... a debt and there it is on\nThe ... and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd then can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's pose that uh the Dow is er and I've seen that with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map\nOkay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all [laughter] that somebody could they could find water and yet there it is yeah up comes to water [laughter] so are is the Dow is there a particularly\nSensitive to the uh electromagnetic flux than the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows\nWhat she does have the scientists we need to we in science cannot ignore this cannot ignore\nThem going all the way back the your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started\nInto shall we say ... ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw two yeah\nYeah so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the\nRain comes within within just now maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that ... yeah\nThey can feel it it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to the to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field of physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one\nYou affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything to travel\nAnd yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles so there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive\nBut we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion of inter connectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again and one more time you bought your Web

talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the role of the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen she was introduced to a person who's studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which of Salem, Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift\nAt the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults say on says she's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me looking forward to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful woman when I was\nAt that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned in the city and she still is on she's known as you know the high priest is a famine and he'll often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's ... president of ... and ... at\nThe time to people welcome or with open arms should they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcome her with open arms but let's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was\nA little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right type of ... in it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town and\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the stability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up\nMy mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you want to scare me she gets you know my father though he thought the girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was saying and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh he has some holy water\nYou know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal um but\nShe didn't really disgusted with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but saying the metaphysical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her is she finally told me that he is you know what Marlene ... from my family for many many years\nLike her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and you're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people who I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the others that you could carry through\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and that she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her truth out she was very unique that what you're saying so the story thank God we're always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nNow you've been with the New England new goes project Maureen since two thousand one what is that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story after and uh near death experience\nUm and he had to work and do a um you know a special court a class that he took to try to keep busy when he was hailing from his illness um\nAnd basically he started doing a cable um you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to [noise] to want to look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation some people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using that\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\n[laughter] I'll show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigation is um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise] um\nSo if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think there are\n\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a\nYou know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the planes itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm yeah I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I say okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home to you know little ranch style house and we we get there and if that\nMeant to guys there want to they just look really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was ... and the big big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so why is just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the merits of shattered in glass table can busted and it just looked like someone went through the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know\nMy phone's been ringing with all the arrows on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling me all the things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes and thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to use them\nUs out of the house and went down thinking jeeze what do we get ourselves into right I'm\nElite run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any dragged me down on the driveway and he looks to me that I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome\nIn something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she and he said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to

White House so we do these hard to toys and one time we were in the um [noise]\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you\nAnd sees windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred sixty degrees and it was one daughter and an out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to him I'm doing my field and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the the side of the world you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came and they didn't want her to missing anything so I I just thought they waited for a night at CERN continually walk all the way to the door and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally I said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough\nThat ... is with the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base a coast guard report and she and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was\nKind of intriguing um perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes typed on uh\nWhat Iowa White House and a bit for pool meal main we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah\nBut I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no there\nWas no sounded out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman as she says why would you see that's that's our dog she says she described that's for sure absolutely yeah SARS clear as day\nLike described it thought she'd just stood there and shook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keeper here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island\nOr the dog wouldn't go so I Would die lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them to a dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses\nBecause she has a dog but that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me at the apple Russia\nWhen it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up at coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight's guess log onto coast to coast am dot com\n[laughter] Wednesday October dead wants new today on the free I her radio last\nFor decorating the house of just letting the scary movie [laughter]\n... and ... with labor in my life we've\nJoe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nA week in sports time capsule\nBefore Sandy Sandy Waxman I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history let's start off back in Nineteen teens where Woodrow Wilson becomes the first us presidents we tend to World Series game\nThis weekend Nineteen fifty the Cleveland Browns played Pittsburgh for the first time in the Steelers thirty Seventeen later this week in Nineteen fifty six Don Larsen of the New York Yankees speeches the personnel here in the history of the world series even better it was a perfect game\nTo this day no other teacher has had a no hitter in the world series\nThis week in Nineteen fifty seven the Brooklyn Dodgers announcer\nManhandled ...

chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron how're you doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] there you go so how often\nDo you get the calls were on for ghost investigations\nYou know it it's funny when we first started we we ... it was quite common but there are so many groups like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... to do it was it was like twenty four in the country knows like twenty four and a nice city but George I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael this just an image now that they are now go with it I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah it's pretty that's\nIt's our number is ... and started club but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring them down from a for doing nothing\nSo that would be good [laughter]\nI think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen\nDoesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know some would have voted for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location [noise] do have to know a where the concentrate you're you're a sophisticated for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recording serious\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the client is for lack of a better word\nFor you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for whom strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have um and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that goes out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us and\nUh and I very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's itself but we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else [noise] um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to the brandy and granted big California walking to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call ...\n... um [noise] yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year\nOf my life and and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see here next coming or being a lot better [laughter] hopefully\nThings starting to go more my way\nMarine this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes at what\nUm okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other kind of coal is no this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that\nFor you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that has taken place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but I'm pulling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying I'm\n... but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put it on a mask\nBut you're not feeling it is that correct or no [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise]\nYeah okay right so put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people that when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone always there yeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um comedy is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back um and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron Maureen the these investigations are more prevalent during Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] not that bad [laughter] it it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably Disney constantly\nMaureen what do you think we gee boards\n[laughter] funny you bring that up [noise] um [noise] you know I think that they're a tool I don't\nThink there's something to be afraid of them I just think it's at the intention that you use when you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because you're not really an open\nAnd you're not protecting yourself and um we've had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using a lead you board and I believe she lives on\nHaving you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited the spirit end and her how her whole life rather went into chaos her home and burnt down a shoe pretty much lost everything\nUh and we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in she was now losing that home\nUm so I don't know what do you think about it wrong\nYou know a a a by parish priest called in and asked me the same question what do you think about ... [laughter]\nI says I've got a collection of the the games [laughter]\nUh and uh I Do I have a ... different ones for use those most good parent how confess the kid is too [laughter] but ah I've got one too I always say though if you're not comfortable doing anything don't do it because you don't trust should go\nRight next up let's go to Matthew in Illinois first time caller he mapped go ahead\nOh I didn't want to George either um there are some of the show\nLike you ... idea of them I work at a nursing home okay and uh you know anything about nursing homes oh you see everything there\nI don't see everything but I have had a occurrence with one at one point um I work night shift\nAnd I was walking in one of the lobby area but there was nobody around but as a judge board and I walked in one day and the board was completely reset up there was one oh I went up to it you know\nJust in money and I I find them yeah I\nNot close to your radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen to my heart radio pick up the ...
