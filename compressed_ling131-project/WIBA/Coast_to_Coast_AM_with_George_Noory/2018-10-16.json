I'm sure that would be something that wouldn't um they may be used for multiple purposes I mean yes it could\nBe used for food they could be from body parts or they could be nice Oregon banks or maybe that's why they might be trying to ... to be more like them so that\nPart's match better more genetically\nMad they started on channel mutilation Chanel they moved up to wash\nExactly uh but it does seem strange that I mean they do seem to pick on\nPeople that are isolated like the Clinton a aisles are disappearing of the two lead housekeepers or they just manage to tell me that\nWell it it happened in Nineteen hundred uh there were two housekeepers uh managing uh a station on a rock basically and they just suddenly vanished when the uh the relief came they didn't find them they found the closer food everything they didn't find them\nThey official explanation was they must have been swept away by a freak wave but further investigation showed clearly know freak wave could reach as high as where they would have been further Martin both then wouldn't have left the lighthouse at once through was once stayed one went out but you didn't have to together\nAnd the evidence seems to show that they didn't go out together one did one didn't because of a missing rain gear so no one knows what happens when they've just absolutely vanished never found bodies in ever traced nothing\nYou've got the Bennington Triangle in Vermont between Nineteen twenty Nineteen fifty people kept disappearing they're one right off of a bus or it just it it goes on and on and on people just vanish here there and everywhere and they're never seen again no trace of them\nSometimes the clothing just left behind in the case of the uh the crippled man back in the Seventeen hundreds of but no sign of him there's no way he could have made it often is on the left him on the porch went out to get him later on and he was\nGone he's gone is is ... was there but he was gone Ninety\nFive Jackson writes in a a Lincoln tunnel in New York a condensation builds up his windshield they pull out the totally pulls over his wife goes out to wipe it off she disappears never seen again\nNothing just like just like that\nPeople ... three famous person disappeared in Nineteen Thirteen December twenty six he was American editorialists a journalist and oddly he wrote a story about a man disappearing by walking across the field and witnesses seeing him simply disappear the story was fiction but then he disappeared no trace of him as ever been found\nNo what if these people are merely walking through some of the time were gone and they just can't get back\nWell that is one theory that may have been a time warp and maybe a dimensional wore a\nAn issue here is\n... and ... and the fabric of space time yes it's it's it's definitely possible but if you go by the number of disappearances\nAre there must be an awful lot of those terrorists in the fabric of space time and it must be everywhere around the planet which is possible but also you know this had been cited in some cases with regard to these disappearances with the disappearance of the Chinese village\nIn um a China are\nYou telling that story\nOkay well this is supposedly happened back around and twenty ten and it was a Chinese village it was in the you know forgive my pronunciation of of the Chinese name or the ... mountains in the ... province and a useful as had been cited there and then all of a sudden\nThey\nRumors started that an entire village of people that simply disappeared and not the village but the people are witnesses said that the roads and the freeway near the village area uh had military on it that uh there were tanks missiles transport vehicles covered with Candace some people think that might have been might have been a nuclear accident is a nuclear power plant here there\nBut that would not count for them bringing in military forces with missiles in tanks just doesn't make sense they disappeared and supposedly have never been found they're not the only ones who was a Canadian village Nineteen thirty that the population disappeared or\nHow many they\nAre the accounts vary this Sunday with thirty men or women and children are the same as many as two thousand\nGone\nGone just vanished the another strange thing is it looked like several dogs had been chained up and has starved to death and yet\nWhen the first person who happened to the scene and Joel the bell he found fires still burning the amber still there half cooked food burnt and the pods as if they had just left there was no sign of anyone they had left everything behind and the people were never found again\nThis was the er an ad and Jacuzzi village\nIn the um who was an Eskimo village right\nIt was an ... yeah in ... maybe I might they might be called now but Ah yes and they um they simply couldn't find them they couldn't find anything they just completely gone and had left everything behind and oh by the way there is also varying accounts of the graves when that counts as one grave was dug up\nAnd about who disappeared in Oakland said all the good for them to go up and the students have been stacked into piles and yet the ground was frozen solid they don't mind\nThat were there any reports of beautiful activity prior to these disappearances\nA search has said that they noticed

are several hours later after ... had come back with his tail and telegraph\nThem and um they couldn't find anything either a one\nOne mounted claimed to have seen an illuminated excuse me illuminated flying thing as he called it it was cylinder shaped a\nDisappearances\nOh this was after the disappearance while he was in the research in a circle and shortly after hours later\nWell you know no coincidence is so strange that crap would be in the area before or after\nWell the ah the blue lights on the horizon this other report of a cylinder logic that was illuminated from within yeah it's a

dot com let me read a little bit about the so yep love pass incident for everybody\nThe diet loved pass incident was an event that resulted in the death of nine ... years north of the Ural Mountains such in Russia on the night of February second to Nineteen fifty nine the incident happened on the eastern side of an area called collapse Shaquille\nWhose name is ... ... dead since then the mountain pass where the incident occurred is called the diet bluff past based on the name of the group's leader\nYour diet the absence of witnesses and the subsequent investigations concerning the deaths of the skiers inspired intense speculation\nInvestigators determine the skiers toward their tent inside out\nLean on foot under heavy snow fall some without shoes although the bodies showed no signs of struggle to victims of fractured skills to broken ribs Soviet authorities determined that an unknown compelling force\nThat caused the deaths access to the region was consequently blocked for hikers adventures from the three years after the incident due to the lack of survivors the chronology bench remains on certain\nRob a bizarre story\nAn incredible story actually and a frightening what did you investigated\n[noise] Ah yes I did I went into some detail and I looked at all the possible answers in detail [noise] and I think the only plausible answer really if you have those I Know the ... with ...\nA prominent for a while but the evidence doesn't seem to support\nThat why would people in sub zero weather be intense without shoes on orange socks and then one day in Iran they when when they fled they fled in their beer feet or what's one sock on or something like that\nYeah so they had all their winter weather here in the tent with them it would have been nothing to snatch it up one of them actually went out with his camera but not as close\nSome things are made them want to run and run so it wasn't just\nThat they didn't run out the entrance of the ten they clogged their way or cut their way through the sides of the tent they were in such a panic to get out\nTo get on with their sense yeah\nYeah and and apparently they couldn't go out the Android so they went out another way and they literally ran through the snow or several were found in a ravine with ... with us you were talking about I'm also one woman had her tongue\nPulled out was are is that what does that reminds you of anything like the animal mutilation\nExactly there was one person who left earlier he went back he wasn't feeling well or his name was Judy you didn't and he died just a few years ago\nBut the he was the last he was the only person who basically got out of that situation and again he left before the incident occurred uh he was one of the lucky ones\nBy saying that well if you have hypothermia and twenty five percent of the cases you actually can feel too hot your body is giving a misleading\nRip off your clothes it doesn't explain the other people state of undress and why they didn't go back and get dressed it doesn't explain how they died and why they died it doesn't explain it and they also seem to die in two separate locations\nAnd the tongue being torn out is very strange they wanted to say that with animals but again it doesn't look as if an animal didn't\nThan some of them had fractures others did not\nAnd others did not and yet none of them seem to have the hemorrhaging or bruising one would associate with something that would cause which has to have cracked ribs\nOne of the Soviets the Russians what do they say\nWell the Russians that their answer a compelling force of nature they simply don't know they closed the case abruptly at first they were examining it very carefully but then suddenly they just slammed the lid on it and that was it\nFor years didn't they are also a makes the the file suit\nPrivate\nOh the the the files are locked up during the entire time of the Soviet Empire it wasn't until after the fall that filed finally became available or I mean it was absolutely sealed it was considered top secret and nothing was said about it\nYou know frankly if they'd been one of their ICBM missiles or something like that probably the why not just sit there with a a test misshapen they were victims of the test that isn't\nSure how they would have been alone stretch though\nThey would have been blown to shreds or I mean it and nothing crashed in those type of thing having crashed right near them yes there were pieces and that'll found and yes it was radioactivity on some of their clothing but not all that I mean how does one explained live\nYou should be all or not\nIt shouldn't be or not right either you're irradiated or you or not but ah so ah ... there's\nThe questions that way outnumber the answer and the only conclusion I can come to personally it's none of the other explanation seem adequate [noise] is that something strange going on there and it was probably extraterrestrial nature yeah for the more I think that area has separate from this for a very long time you have a mountain called mountain of the dead are dead mountain\nYou had the area that they were tracking to to get there called don't go there and the native local tribe and by the way this isn't the only place like that there are other places and the Siberian area where they have these um\nMiddle half a context um objects like a half domes and wherever they are nothing grows and people are warned not to go near them because they will kill you and\nThose areas are named the same and those things have been there so long that the local tribes people have named one of the rivers was named for one of these things called they called them\nCall them do they do talk about this case in Russia\n[noise] uh yeah they do talk about it of course it's like here they don't talk about it officially but there is a a Fishell a museum and said I don't want even try to pronounce the name but ah they have one and they are trying to um\nCome up with more information but they have whatever information they have is that museum that they have access to\nAnd yet there are people still talking about people still investigating\nYet Catherine thank you that's really high and that's where the foundation is right\nYeah yes it is yes and ah they they have a Memorial Day or two the nine of them so ah but to a Russian is difficult for me to pronounce that can do the Greek and Latin but the Russians have been hard for me\nYeah yeah\nI Know devoted to it and that's about it\n... does well done yeah\nThose that don't you I Know that one as well and that's it that's my Russian so [noise] uh and of course uh even the name you know you pronounce that diet love ... love but uh\nYeah this is an interesting case and again Russia seems to have a long history of this especially in that region when you native tribes people are naming regions as debt mountain don't go there cauldron river\nThe place of the dead this is not good [laughter] the fare\nWell in this little Canadian area that these people disappear that's fascinating too\nAnd it's very similar in a way isn't it except that you didn't find any body they just completely vanished [noise] uh and and and it's strange because one can only conclude\n[noise] ... or whatever [noise] too far away they\nAre citizens of Roanoke Colony remember that back in the Fifteen hundred or the rest of the teen eighty seven and they all thirty men and women and children vanished without a trace\nIncluding yeah just crying\nAnd the only thing they were ... into a tree\nThe bar and these people were never again or the ... and early ...\nWhile I Am and obviously this fishing village this ah in the fishing village in Canada where all these people disappeared um something something's not right\nNow again and and it looks like something is going on because I think it's going on and it's not a good you\nKnow it was our ... it\nDidn't use this other thing the machine missing Malaysia place a plane or three Seventy lots of conclusions I'm writing a for a day but Wayne and Richard elder comes out next month and a matter of fact some all Spanish but we kicked around various theories

historian longtime friend the coast to coast am a porch and Mitch has a very\nPopular Boyce of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back much George great to be here I always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've cross this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already [laughter]\nYou know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City and the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was tried that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members that caught [laughter]\nThat was probably about five of them they were just a little group side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting with San says and medium ship and\nTalking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds\nIt's it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things than they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this offensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as\nWell as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist\nAnd they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that\nHowever we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events mentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf other ... before you came on and use that he was in Israel and of course great Mentalist\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved it and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've been expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know ... Michel delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class and the ... or or type pin and he lost it and you couldn't find it\nAnd he was telling a story about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tide class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it\nWas in ... ice cream [laughter]\nYellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing they're living there for that [laughter]\nJust amazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like to people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but nothing too but\nYou know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people and in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are positive and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to great teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project negatives spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there's an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I thought they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nDon't forget to watch our TV show beyond belief with George Mallory just log onto beyond belief dot com [noise]\nGoing to go to the white guy don't matter morning this morning by on your team and why da\n... strain weekday and eleven or to be laughing about what a what do we do hear their intangible why BA\nThat's real family care dot com ... three three four six seven eight to five nights for Medicaid plans from optimal health\nFree from forty years earlier mass killer Michael Meyers escapes Laurie in a local cops came up to capture him and\nProtect your family from his raft Judy career will patent Virginia gardener and Mick casual also star and there's horror sequel\nBased on the twenty seventh ... same name as a gift from the director of barber shop in Seoul for\nStars a girl who lives in a poor neighborhood but in terms of fancy prep school rather easy balance of distinct worlds collapses when one of her close friends or shot beverage effects reverberate through both communities ...

mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold affirmation in mind or silently\nRepeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night that he is an exquisitely unusual\nSupple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experienced it just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIn seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my ... is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nAnd what are some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it\nBecause once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning\nNoon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to you quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent\nBecause sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that's a method we can all do and it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television then narrating and and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics\nIn the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family\nOr things that have road tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do the patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing we're kind of people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that is true everybody who's listening is automatically a member of the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in the miracle club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it in my website and my email email me and I will send you your own\nMembership card to be in the miracle club you can sign that you can fold it laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts steady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get a miracle club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories it is ... you know\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable circumstance\nSo that it will come back with calls next on coast to coast they\nFind out more about tonight just log on to go to go day in ...\nThink we just\nThey're rock

Vicki McKenna for your drive home on Thirteen tin WMBA [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat might come back to the coast to coast George story with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down a goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity and the one hand and he behind every health health program with it\nSomething will work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus\nIs the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your own\nToll on my own you know this was really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental hearing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are strive for is all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our minds\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle what I had a friend in New England who is recovering from a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nHis name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you are very deeply the magic of believe\nYeah and loved though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents his old boss had to have you looked at it\nThere's over fifty thousand\nDollars ... ... ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's ... with the experience and it was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know\nYes yes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take and as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take and twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou

really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple thing and then run that seeing through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple thing in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders\nAnd you always need to bring it back if you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you you've got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality
