the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day as good as my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in elite group\nOf science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know and I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff a ... or packing for Mars and was she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great\nGift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it is interesting is like and you know I spent fourteen years that\nUh ABC News you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I credit cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the story that I Walk with me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back alive the head being the most important part because they carry\nOur memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I get in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious you\nKnow in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving dinner essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise] what I think we need now because we are at the threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an eight it's in the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an expert in the wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I like ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it it's so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my age very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist debates system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next pitch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list [noise]\nNext on coast to coast am ...

News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were defined the natural order of thing and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice ... nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about\nSome of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about [noise] and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide when\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing that he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be\nMost complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I play in every once in a while you\nWrite in artificial intelligence now can beat the pants off her you know the the goat champion and so it's pretty that writing is on the wall man I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no they're no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at yeah well you know like you they're ... they're putting it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment IQ you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are the Jewish it ... the equation is which used it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be like we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly the imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy up yeah yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or the last ... you'd walk in the spinal injuries and\nAnd that this to them is a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three ... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess\nA but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about\n... humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement called the trans human movement where as you said the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that they usable a trend human augmentation there so there is usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely cripple\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neural off the prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that required you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his car that they're they're wired to\nMind that I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you name it even in\nEven in a military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there you know where you know write it get it get it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I'm fifty six pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella got what kind of take some of that load up their own yell at them but I think that uh\nI think it would be a threat to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I\nThink that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to um [noise] that idea about uh about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried\nMaybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one [laughter] and and that leads a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon uh using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are\nRobot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words do give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago you\nWere going to be now and another escalating arms race right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know so oh our faults in our ... our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum is not the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla and this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nEr and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hand on the new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween\nYou kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in the pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nBy that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are uh her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it\nAnd they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so I think that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that that kind of a ... year treasury rate or your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than eight billion\nOf things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show the thing\nIn whether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch [noise]\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join the mystery\nThe end of life as we know it

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the least looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the what the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit\nOne of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah yeah\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right in right after\nYou read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time so bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA that when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] and now they're I think the question you\nWere talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God it's\nWork out a upon and find it said that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone it come down and in and cover them up and are they talking about this this theory that you're talking where we've achieved getting more\nAloe this is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian\nI'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference the revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ...\n... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server\nOr in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the sky net running it's like running\nOn on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or for the\nCrush souls of the people it's dumped son and you know getting ... getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right happy I haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nKnown hey my question for your Stovall and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion yeah or if they do we just lose him\nWe just lost [laughter] oh\nNo Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but uh I've\nBeen on and kicking machine going on forty five years yes or a bank or do generation I'd like to know from your guest or when we feel that the shoe will be overcome through Chris or or\nA maybe a ... either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air and\nHang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides they're already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second\nGeneration ah that will help actually restore\nSight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful but\nThat's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest no thank you so much for your time and through your joyful spirits and looking

I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but I did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about\nUm about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told [noise]\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible and that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that\nIt starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murders stories still do what I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot\nWhen we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did the ...\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why do you uh from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and

I couldn't remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exist out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years\nI'm ... because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covered right here I'm a good one at a wrap it up quickly a lot I could go into about her book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier could affect color you\nAre talking about live along the lines of\nIt you you appreciate the freedom we have\nA we we all worship something you know whether it's money or her metabolism or whether it's got him or her so\nUm that we really appreciate that great and it's just that you should stay there for you to worship your way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that for sure but I did it because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have a buddy ... individually or can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about each the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's at the border that makes me in Arizona in right or it shouldn't be a a a cans and it's like we didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds us together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think\nThat's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot ah\nFor people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for jumping\nIn an open lines and a look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case [noise]\nGlitter make that decision I Want to think uh George Norris Chris boroughs I Want to thank Lisa lion I Want to think Tom Dana is or who just called TD\nUp for a give me this opportunity to continue to come back and I'm looking forward to the same thing in November picks them dates to coming up and in December so it looks like a couple of times a month\nAll of a chance to host coast to coast that you only because of all the kind words that you pass along so thank you very much until tomorrow night when Halloween tradition will continue on coast to coast\nGave him a and I do too [noise]\nA couple of quick hits on what's coming up later on for open lines and Michael Steele and coming up next an coast to coast am in for George Nouri this is Ian ... on it [noise]\nMy ... you could try this kind of stuff so I had I lodged condition he's also a killer how to stop talking kinda boring it was just incredible feeling so I feel that you can rent my when I had the auditor and flight or\nSomething I might see in which case while I was actually a contract staggering at least one thing that you can check out soft I could kind of way that might result started coming Kurt\nIt kind of ... excuse well I\nThink that works beautifully owner Richard astro here we're talking about the power waking up your immune system which has hail this gentleman's heart perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies\nFears this powers to he'll visit C.

and we will not disappoint both tomorrow night and tonight or coming up uh again tomorrow night the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nAs scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects that some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen will ... joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment that coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the full right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to coast am dot com and that's this struggle to play a little bit of it here give you a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on in the show rolled in\nDowntown Oregon City there are there to at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a candidates dispensary\nWhole if you dare they surveillance video from August watched the glass tipped John on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy going that's next to it\nAs okay positive here for a new we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to come\nAnd look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on\nOkay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils or I don't know your ... believe me there's there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous\nNews from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard and I was going to have my son was born in ... a year and I don't know I'm kinda caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that and that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and\nPlay you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in the few huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots\nThat third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[laughter] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described\nA fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series\nYou know the facts ma'am right Andrew I that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand what notes that you can imagine\nOh no ... I read through to you you're very very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServed this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are brilliant a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise] what I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA than on the Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into the wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it ... it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nWe then that's where we'll go with the next pitch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list [noise]\nNext on coast to coast am this is the\nWorst that no one to go when you want to be a\nYou our hero someone committed to sing that our veterans get the benefits they've earned in this or\nGo

physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nTrying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's\nIt's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's nice that does not nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none I I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now I own a margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according\nTo science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking\nThey are yeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right or we have a a a a juicy or peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about\nSome of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide when\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so on but he\nRecently applied to the area and was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if\nWe continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot\nHoward by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because he did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that they you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you\nKnow ...\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or her you\nKnow the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... they're putting it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average you know accusing it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy ... ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that the you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like\nLike marriages like democracy like friendship [noise]\nI think

video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar it'd be didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City here are very funny at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witnessed that science erode treat a can of this dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nAs it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody who is like right here\nSuddenly the jar bombs on the level surface that just happens then Andy remembered the surveillance handling salvage I\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly the pans begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... states certified many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a form of ... to ... and so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's a real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but what if you go and look at if you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nAnything good morning hours y'all\n[laughter] we're good thank you\n[laughter] yeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run the reports of animal or children\n[laughter] yes well anyway I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's not going to be a good to be in the Eighteenth inning for those games world series or the question of being whether this show ends before the game ends but where do you want to take all\nOh about ... oh sure\nWell everything was fine and the trailer talked about a floating there's not a supercomputer are occurring live forever ... blah blah and one problem\nDownload memory and download horses could download mannerisms can download action match by robots now but it won't be Larry King because you\nCan't show [laughter] so I guess some of the feelings and the personality of the callers I\nI'm with you in your it I mean within ... in a\nRow the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's growing up I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\nWhy wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because I used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I'm In a world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a revival manner or would it have anything to eat ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and that says firemen now and furthermore\nIt our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival
