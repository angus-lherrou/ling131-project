I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that is kind of you if you can test and said yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get that I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them did anyone\nI didn't write that at all that new wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's critical if it's a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some of the some of his only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really they've been getting\nMore and more a year round kind of tourist and not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and throw happens their biggest one is October which\nWill never go well\nI Do it really is I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the tapes as open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but but other than what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now is certainly open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem would it ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people aren't you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as\nFiguring that especially in the air around you and the other time of year there's not that many curb but in October\nFor instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar and federal party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over start start heading to the train and start having your cars\nSo there that's really good at ten pm yeah\nI Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yet they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad that they got to get them up\nBefore the ... or maybe they're doing the real which happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things are and have a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween of sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast day I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next and coast to coast am\n... years ago making a murderer became let the TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan nasty trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of rebuilding a murderer\nReminding a murderer is now in the ... I have a radio address has to win the up and have fun\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the ...\nEleven counts of murder crime Del Walters Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Rob Bowers faces the forty six year old charred was opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this is what it sounded like on police radio\nPlace it is that those narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I studied\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks rattling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is it allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before her death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer worked a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nThat not run for your life [noise] uh all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nAnd the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting and do a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rest some the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up\nOnly a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about uh\nPeople who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though

I had\nTold my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur in the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last ... last murders and the series\nSo ah we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc typed crime just for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then ... excessively after that um it\nIs is

favorite happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was a a a ... his great great\nAunt had been was one of the victims of the crime that he had always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book that uh um\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a shy who said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that ban hadn't actually gotten away with it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know if there's a lot of different but are you still have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think we can\nAhead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all ... all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that these ... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was really a whether you are or what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live a ...\nPeople\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happen to you and me and people have our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death for that's a terrible picture because they look bad parable bath I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for\nThe um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\n... ... what is it that always sticks with me that trait that party or the bank thing and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invent that it uh one of them I think it would suck co were had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he\nHad a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors\nIn a tally and community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would write with not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the tally in American communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nExcept that it's important in a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYeah but I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa I'm ended the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a a a killer on the railway tickets take us through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nSuspect so let's let's go through that [noise] let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train [noise] does he have a name [noise] next coast to coast am this is the opponent [noise]\n\nWhat are you doing whether whether they\nTell me why [noise]\nBurials many common Linda ...

co author of the men from the train to the research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you show sorry I got the wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work to you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove it\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nSometimes I think ... ship rocks from side to side and when you\nKnow you you walk from side to side for a day or two before you start walking oh interesting you're a sailor for years and years\nThen you never get over it you always walk inside rocks from side to side issue [noise]\nInteresting I never knew that um and so you have you ever heard of some called fractal theory\nOr the name is a little familiar but I couldn't tell you what it is\nSo is there is a math fractals theory but there's also this other theory about um how fractals theory relates to us personally and psychologically people will talk about fractals in terms of that we we we have a tendency to replicate\nUm circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship they know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the uh that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was or his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity ... along\nSo that you know the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first ... ... exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was that that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look at that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense of justification for what he did that but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nAnd the the pedophilia peace uh ... especially abusing the corps if that's what happened\nUm speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because\nIs an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the event live I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and he said he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time with the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a tanker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through and about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm a nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know they it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut uh it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was ... a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken\nTruly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of over ... you know norm had do not have normal fear and one thing that the parent about this the ... the ... and the training that from his crime that he it was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller and Matt from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and going to say well\nHere's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity is totally new dawn and printed the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really you take some questions for sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer for you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also does quite a bit of a to\nA and I may throw in a strange question about the Boston springs I mean that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give you the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today it's ... am done\n\nBut while your child may suffer from asthma\nIt's among doesn't have to make your child suffer there are simple ways you can prevent your child's next attack\nTo learn more log on to W.

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nWe're talking about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know the until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was I tend to rent longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this we will just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are looking to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by coincidence where I'll be driving leaks hum\nIll I've got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer only again ever seen any evidence from a ... like one of the ...\n... what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand they act with which the less murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and uh has been presented with a guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have a lot of it and so\nAll right uh you know what they call will buried by nature\nWell we don't it disappeared we've never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured he might have worked for the road it how it got to every place but it did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a ticket for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might appreciate that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal record and murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self employed the\nPerhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that a lot of stocking but uh the just war game itself into the frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen\nA ... and ... and he came into town\nMay no contact with anyone spoke to no one and ... that was part of his criminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his first crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight\nEight did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and the the lead to a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he had gone on the train a for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad he always tells you that the intersection to railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance that year\nThere'll be there'll be stranded waiting for trying to\nCompare yeah that's a question that really forgot what it was you\nKnow that's an

piece about the experiments that inspired Frankenstein\nSo as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way\nThis is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story that people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling science fiction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like I\nWas like a I robot both the\n... version and then the robot that came before as a most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in that very first\nVersion of a robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding of life\nAfterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense\nInsider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then\nYou know they would it would become the new Roswell I'm kind of happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just Halloween itself it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course of the month it's it's an a quarter million though the masses of people that small city to have that its borders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative but we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout ... and the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... ... ... there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nI always try to tell people that federal isn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one that was shot and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which has killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed country there's still winter being being scared for being with you but the strange thing about that to me of course see the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nThat's which city usa so we'll get to that uh she's with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nAnd the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am this is the impact\n\n\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aid companies need most around here there's a shortage of nurses computer engineers in cybersecurity experts guess who's feeling these jobs no regrets\nIn fact many often get to pick from multiple job offers do think you're settling with no education\nOver two hundred and sixty years later with a little resourcefulness\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy whenever they\nWant you to your desk and they have to worry about why the talk on the word\nThe fly\nRaw statue bowl\n\nWell\nNo\nNo\nThis is coast to coast am we input on it\nSo plain that bumper on purpose it doesn't sound\nLike you would be Halloween bumper but it is for anybody who's seen the Netflix series the hunting of hill house [laughter] because that's been the theme they play a kind of a slowdown spooky version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was\nUm Stephen King praised at a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ended deserves it it's just your great great story and it's told really well it has nothing to do with the book\nRight as very little to do with any of the other versions of the ... house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions were these slightly changed the title\nA but it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's that good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky\nMore in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of he'll house on Netflix\nIs is just a one of the rare or Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie\nIs that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see it I I don't know if I could have handled it if I had seen it so take a look for that
