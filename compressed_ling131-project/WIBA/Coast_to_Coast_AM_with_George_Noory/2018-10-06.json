experience at a local like I'm not far from where I live probably rather than an hour has friends come over that person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to like you want to go\nUh well I just had a scan acts that my niece was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people but little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how no maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like well whatever and I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a\nWintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a ... right and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so\nThey they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean\nThis was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this by then it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air and\nUh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known him because I worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven I was in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no moment um so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk\nSo I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in\nThe evening and the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh are farther out and have an hour it'd be named\nLeaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this do that I went up her where

later here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we are in a car pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept

others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know it may be\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and ah I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the slaughter right and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place and then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was\nAn old dad gummed seating bar yeah and I went in there with them and to this\nBy then it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air\nAnd I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three
