have improved\nBut according to the Gallup poll Trump's approval rating as up his six hundred and thirty second day in office was forty four percent as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now

four percent and above both Clinton at forty one percent and Reagan forty two percent at this same stretch and the presidency\nDid you know that higher approval rating at this point than both Clinton

together some information try see what's really going on out there\nAmong likely voters you average out likely voters Donald Trump's approval ratings right now is four points higher among likely

scared\nThe heck out of it when they had to flee for the live what followed them in what killed them and why and how did it manage it they don't seem to even know how they died they assume hypothermia [noise]\nLet the crack ribs weren't enough to kill the skull fracture wasn't enough to kill them a with a bruise that are attendant with a crack ribs there weren't any so yeah that to me is probably the strangest\nSomething's going on I mean this was a big planet it's a huge universe is there's so much going on but when you think of genesis and you hear\nThe story of the fallen angels do you tie in these extraterrestrials without do you think that's possibly what they were talking about\nYes I Do and I do believe the uh [noise] there was one of them that was probably like ... because he appears\nRepeatedly throughout history and different forums for me it's just the guy who gave us fire\nOr the serpent and the garden of Eden who gave us food from the tree of knowledge and was punished for it or repeatedly you have this this apparently rogue God if you want to call them that are extraterrestrial who hated us and was punished eternally for having done that\nSo yeah I Do think that definitely it dates back to the time of genesis\nAll right let's go to the polls now we'll go to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to get things wrong with the St Peter sorry about your Steelers when you're on the air\nNo problem we have six Super Bowl championships there will be okay\n[laughter] oh sure your\nAh your guest tonight amazing and I want to come from everything that you believe in about the moon and the alien then the moon the blue light six cetera because it happened to me\nUh ten years ago I seen about twenty to thirty blue UFOs around the moon\nAnd that something might have happened where they had to evacuate for a short period but I was one of the fortunate ones to say this event about a month later I was confronted by what's the word dark hoarded entities about three of them\nCould be aliens could be demonic because they were truly negative ads you said they are they attacked\nThe may they tortured me I went through the process I even touch them they were trying to touch my kid needs my liver I grab whatever they are at hand and I fought back I Want to know from you\nWhy did I Survived this that's what I've always was guy I said I Am with God and when I said that they talked into demonic voice and they said you know nothing about God and they were very insulted that I use that that I was\nOn why did I Survived and how did you get out of it you know what I mean did they leave you or did you run away from my room\nUm a lot of people talk about these hundred black entities because it's so common they left my room\nThere were three of them they saw me looking at them believing that offended them two of them laugh the other one went from about three and a half feet tall too about eight foot tall to intimidate me and I feel like a little kid\nWhat are you thinking about when Rob\nI think it's pretty a terrible I'm I'm Wondering do suffer from any sort of post traumatic stress disorder as a result of all of this\nAfter all my research over the years I Would believe that my health\nI declined slightly the anxiety level is much higher but at the same time I have seen more you have a I have seen balls of electricity the orange spheres I think I'm more in touch with that element now but why did I survive why why wasn't I ripped apart why wasn't I take it and why did I make it through\nWell my personal answer to that would be just lucky where we had some kind of guiding\nHand or help involved in some way either way it boils down to you're very lucky because a lot of people don't ah maybe there was something about you maybe this thing about your behavior or\nMaybe the maybe she's scared them\nThat could be maybe his attitude and behavior toys that was enough to make them decided to go somewhere else you know when people Rob homes they look for the easiest home to Rob not the ones with alarms\nOr going to be so that's right\nYeah so maybe just decided to go elsewhere\nMatched up we go to rich in Los Angeles now hey Richard turn go ahead\nWonderful which ought to be on your show Jordan thank you\nUm yeah I was always wondering about um the plows Seventeen or the NASA photographs\nBecause there's like photographs with like robot heads and like turkey machine that can combustion engines [noise] and you don't share the NASA photographs and um I always worry about that and then they had like a um\nSome people say that's why they they say that the moon missions or states because um [noise] it's like suddenly doctored the photos to like show people back on earth what astronaut saw so\nI'm like a wonder like you know what do you think about all the\nLiquor asking me I think you're absolutely right I don't think the NASA missions were faked a we have too much evidence to show that it didn't I mean we weren't the only ones tracking the radio signals from that\nAre from those ships every country on earth with including the Soviets at the time and believe me if we had been faking it they would have now\nAlso they are left asked myself things including the size and the graphs and things that we're still using to this day and a device that we can shoot him off to measure distance from the earth to the moon and we know the moon is getting a little further away as a result\nSo there's a lot of evidence to show that we actually did go there on a number of occasions where there in person [laughter]\nUm but I Do think they're talking a pictures I think the evidence for that is overwhelming\nThere's a photograph from the ... Seventeen that's like it was why it out the official NASA explanation but when you contrast that you see a pyramid\nAnd like the the contrast photo and you know so so you know I guess they had to people just couldn't accept it and they had a doctorate that used to that robot head of the photo Rob I haven't seen the robot\nHad it looks like it looks like little ... pizzeria on something like that\nYeah we ... with ... with like lipstick or whatever and then you look at the outline you see the head and it looks like a body exploded and I heard on the actual transmission from NASA on that flight\nThat they were in there and the car and then they they were looking at this wreckage or like there was a it was created with like an orange color that's what they went to check it out for and then when they were looking at it they're like they turn they turn up the box or whatever it was\nThey're saying because they're like they're like whoa you know this is pretty bizarre stuff and then uh you know so that you know what was it was a Buzz Aldrin he's the one that said that there is you know extra terrestrial life doesn't you know this or that guy like either he's old on either each crazy or\nOr\nOrder [laughter]\nI Love and then all you're going to do Rob Google Richard hold Lund H. O. H. G. L. E. N. D. comma data and da da da and you see the images come up in ... it's weird it doesn't look like a rock to me it looks like December and head of a robot\nI haven't seen that one I have seen the Richard ... pictures and I have to see the ones like of the paper clip the tower the chard all of those\nYou know just when you're going to win it's really strange\nI I have to check that one out because that one I haven't seen and I thought\nI'd seen them all by now to be honest with you [noise] uh but they are really I think they're doctoring these pictures I think there are brushing them I think the evidence is there for absolutely\nAnd I think there are things on the moon and accounted for it you were mentioning the Apollo missions I think things we've seen by the astronaut see them um I Believe it was a the original site puddle eleven where they said that they saw an area that had a strange glittering pattern to the\nWell there's always going to talk to an old ... and Neil

democracy and we begin to understand why it is and whether we have a Republican or a Democrat in the White House\nSo many of the policies are safe\nAnd we see that whether it's Obama or it's a Bush or whoever it is that they pursue fairly similar strategies and we say who really runs this country and I think that it's crucial that we explore the Kennedy assassination to figure out what happened to

you think about living in a mobile home for a year's save up for a down payment on myself [noise]\nWouldn't be a problem or if you're reading it I wouldn't buy a mobile home [noise]\nMobile homes go down in value is the only thing you know that you live in that goes down in value even\nIf you buy dirt under it goes up and value more than it goes down in value so it appears you didn't lose money lost money your buck fifty thousand dollar mobile home in a few years or ten thousand dollar mobile I'm about fifty thousand dollar house in a few years it's a hundred thousand dollar house ...\nThe show you just don't want I mean cars go down in value mobile homes go down in value it's a car you sleep in\nI mean that's what you're dealing with so if you want to rent one that's fine I've had a few people over the years that have called me that went and bought a five thousand dollar mobile home put it on a piece of ground pay cash for it\nKnowing that the ... of our mobile home gonna be worth three thousand dollars but they're gonna lose ... a and R sir form of rent while they save up money and pay cash to build a house on that when\nPeople do stuff like that that's fine but there is out there you go about Seventy five eighty a hundred thousand dollar fifty thousand or a mobile home and call that a good long term bland no it's not a good long term plan it goes down and value the simple\nArt a buddy of mine owns a huge mobile home operation and he's always give me a hard time would you do when I said well they want to what's being true of which we've got some that go up in value on it when when when I see that as an across the board thing you\nKnow I Will tell you this manufactured housing is what they always call it's around one way or the other there's all kinds of manufacturing housing sometimes that means mobile home sometimes that means the wall system for building a factory there stood 'em up and it basically looks like a stick built a house\nAnd so it's treated by the purchasing public\nLike a traditional home\nWhatever you're buying why don't care what words you use to describe but the question you ask yourself is when I woke up in front of a door I say\nA ball or do I say house if you walk up in front of it and you say how ugly house pretty health but it's a house right then then that's going to go up in value\nIn a mobile home with the wheels off sitting on a concrete foundation that looks all permanent still looks and feels like a mobile home when you walk into it and as long as people think it was that it's not a house it's not going to go up in value because that's how the market perceives it\nAnd that's what you got to look at so whatever you're putting into that you're throwing the money away\n... ... what do you think about living in a mobile home for a year to say for a down payment if you're doing that five thousand are mobile home ... bike export and lived there for a year while I save up some money that's fine because you're just given up you know some of the five thousand dollars\nNot turning not allowing fifty thousand on something that's now worth thirty\nWere you upside down and the thing um or if

right now and that is not a lot of good for the blind and for a students who need scholarships yeah\nIt sure does how did you get involved in the collectibles\nWell I got involved in and take away a lot of people do I just felt that everything else [laughter] not really\nBut you know I I was a middle aged guy in a restaurant business I was a stock market or caster I used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I work at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out [noise] things usually work and life\n... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties\nI don't know where they are I've asked my mother who is eighty nine years old mom checked the attic where are they she says George ... we gave them away what I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle Kurd pose a whiz in great good shape your real good shape right what would you suppose your it attacks yeah All right you're running around out there in the city angels\nCome across and all I don't know how the Hundred Years' old big coup all out there and as a farmer and I just sold the house I'm just getting rid of this stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit\nEgg cell or some facts you guys can outsmart right right you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years\nThe fifty two man told Aaron excellent condition ask him a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that's where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for it by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth ... somewhere in the neighborhood of you know two hundred thousand dollars you know yeah oh\nI had al ... lines I had mental sigh of Willie Mays I had him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicate ths remember\nWith the duplicates in generally your head like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie card artist so\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much uh probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly a now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little\nThe money right there everybody's on the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nPlaying football ... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete had Michael Jordan rookie Kurds that before they cut the cards it's called the big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be buying if you get yourself like addict by his rookie come the bike discard right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think

to make money in antiques just adjust instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old doesn't\nLook at how does the it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's gonna buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican to love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right\nBy the name id they named beautiful
