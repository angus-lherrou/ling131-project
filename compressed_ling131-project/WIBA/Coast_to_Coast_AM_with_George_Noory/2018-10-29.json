WMBA [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back we're talking with Dick Redfern um you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it sort of the the the inspiration for this new book of yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou're talking about the the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] yeah and of course you know subsequent generations growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm In\nFavor of the night before the Internet age will remember it was not that sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and um\nYou know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations it's gonna be helping normal thing for probably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of\nThe fear that people used to have that maybe the government is going to talk us into getting a computer chip\nStuck on to our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and all kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance device that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually facial vacation guide to the first to November people can already got it\nBut the reason I wrote top secret abduction falls is because over the years I collect a number of official documents on abductions which are painting ... during the famous from ice\nAn act in the u._k. um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where I could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy to showing how falls would be put together now I start the book actually with the contract to a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomena by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them how to FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI\nBut yes like climate I have these experiences with aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had\nA governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file um he's extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he was the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when John full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow gee what's intriguing is that they they\nAh British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the ... it talks about how the they ... they promised in the security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of by this encounter with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know Boatright completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realized that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA sciences studied UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge Vegas gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments that communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the\nThat they're probably already plain Clinton now to

[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back Christopher white received his PHD in religious studies from Harvard University where he studied religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality and ... church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural\nStudies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this movement and new direction by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... ah around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or even increased\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess would be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and try to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real young kind of like a science nerd and and the fence and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multiverse for thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and brace with ... with a sense of a mystery and and the longer\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for a new spiritual conception and I and I I'm not that I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time relating normally Georgia\nThrough that [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm I it it's it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of\nWhy those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of ...\nThe book I I you know I asked the question well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to another to ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that ... after all I mean we have\nWe know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with and\nThen you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction\nUm or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be a you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and the the something else as the drinking part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox but at the square character did have these wild ... and even at the visionary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking about our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea are very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment we're talking with\nChristopher white about other world spirituality and the search for

there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people have a false picture of the universe and

the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other world Janelle developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles ... is one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah\nYeah yeah yeah he was his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious and a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes to Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make a right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him but I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nOf scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see see I'm into the future and you write these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time\nThe book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that your explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations on her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss depending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of blocking universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYou're right you're right they waste it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on hum so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did\nAs they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that you know the facts\nIn the future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more possible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should start ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one ... dimension dreaming and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd don't believe that um you know using a bit of aren't buying here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space law or is there um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming conscious of had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom\nBut that's what he thought and he's you know everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and you also believe that everyone if they haven't got the journal by their bed of their dreams and when they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and how that I'm sort of mixed up together [noise] well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science as a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program

sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even see if we talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as being that come down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the fear that that and and the un Abbott's book a flat land so\nYeah people definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher realms or or spiritual being for angels or whatever I'm Out higher dimensional hum and have a kind of hard eventually object but then on top entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality yeah\nI think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nYou know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like an ... um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and a skeptic so I have different voices in the book um\nYou know talking about what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is are these people who have these kinds of
