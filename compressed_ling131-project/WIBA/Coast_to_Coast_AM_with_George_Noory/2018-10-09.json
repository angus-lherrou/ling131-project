book the fourth age if I were an Ilan mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was ... we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are\nUm I find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um well my probably cost about a I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nThat that may be more that that may do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggests the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because\nThe single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um\nIf you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\n... he is at the humane\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find out what the intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it can it if you out of business that can make probably any department in your business and ten percent faster ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advanced ... and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nA it's a fantastic question um\n\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty\nPounds explode that's a very rudimentary very rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or carrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniffer gunpowder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we are going to make a ton of killings systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun tour it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions have require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a a weapon systems it's good to have\nWell for for three or various reasons you can argue the uh\nThe the better the more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will be saving lives a soldier ... ... ... and ... and whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the political cost going to war which is there's no not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if there's no cost a then perhaps it's entered into irrationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour show

automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ... percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years off of the job Spanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ...\nYears right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to\nDo it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody she says it and says I'm going to use this to increase by on productivity so what ever if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's ... billion people are gonna use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to bed and she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents at the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you what does he ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air being be remember\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nThey if you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip it I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know they you you still a drink you know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you are the special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the Russians were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has tend to\nI was in skills than thousand things you can do and then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots they can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes other batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come a people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house silver figures out where to punch your wall out\nTo run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that um but like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain basement Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book to for the age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we\nLearned something so big and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is it you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant sort of sanctions emerge ... America and just go over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what's gonna what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with a mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bond will be er a by the thousands in the bottles\nHumans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that's the only official intelligent and it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nThe Nineteen eighty nine people in Nineteen Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nTheir relationship to damage her kids everyone involved in a divorce has affected by the breakup of the family court Allen Cornell tries to help you to this tough time so that then you can move on with your last call that domestic\nLitigation from of course down in Cornell to schedule an appointment with one of our firms medicine attorneys a partner men can count on six zero eight two three four four zero for for that six zero eight two three four\nFour zero for for what reason on line and Cornell Cornell dot com Cordell in Cordell zero four zero in ...

GDP did go on a fault just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet medical insurance no higher education do they can grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine the machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine a\nFix by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faith than being a wife hand now can pay for and and ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... and ... get faster than our ...\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're the guest barb is entirely right uh we are using a ton of his weapons were killed decision of course we've done that\nSince landmines wheat crop would drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and they will go and decide that's a non combat vets combative I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nThe fourth age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble a decision by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out\nJune June very simple things one uh individual worldwide average income per capita\nThe last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ seventeenth fifty nothing happened flat if you look starting Seventeen fifty is shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all the hungry people\nIn the world no question that the world strains to feed them\nOr we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer next\nNow you can get show updates and connect with other coast fans when you joined that goes to stay in the book they just go to Facebook dot com slash ... him and the like button [noise]\nTime indeed the Steelers thirty Seventeen last week in Nineteen fifty six Don\nLarsen in the New York Yankees speeches personnel hearing the history of the\nWorld Series even better it was a perfect game\nDid they say no teacher has had a no hitter in the world series\nThis week in Nineteen sixty seven the Brooklyn Dodgers denouncing moved to Los Angeles Los Angeles agreed to build a new stadium something to Brooklyn wouldn't agree to the Dodgers played their first four seasons in Los Angeles memorial coliseum see for opening Dodger Stadium\nOn April ...

James Cameron on a year and a half ago talking about some of his work and what a genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to man I I have some great stories about him where he is just allowed me and to\nUm like the the theater where they record all the music and he said Julie stand here this is where the director stands and they you know it's the best place to here they get every beat and I'm like oh I Love this guy you agreed back room by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly rates in Oklahoma talking about my day job your\nDay job we haven't done the Oklahoma new Bill Bill we do [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nAnd knew how did you end up in Los Angeles ... the the truck work for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma and I made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco and\nThen maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who calls their book that goes photographer\nWhat some of your peers said about the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executives doing some ... work and now you're writing a story about the goals we'll talk for\n[noise] you know this it's it's a it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is rooted in data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization is being in a very direct on us kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence 'cause they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff [laughter] and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent\nUm you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our nine that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of those things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go so we're almost the majority\nAttorney were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this\nAnd every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is going to bring the word ghost that are saying\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is is listening um but they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey either way\nI barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now you have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... started for you because of a personal situation\nYes totally did did you know if this started from me I'm I'm I mean the\nBook really is a journey and develop transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph and at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so\nEverything in my life I think about it and forget exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes well hold her guys what am I done 'em and\nThen I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with if\nYou have been doing several things what kind of camera do you [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Samsung camera not have found but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um or or not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire dirty looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry the even get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted investigating these strange things\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky\nI um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas\nThrough this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood and um so ...\nSo I had some guides I ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um\nI I started you know and then after I saw the first coast and a photograph I um you know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before skeptic as in it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know much\nRight right I it it was in a this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos\nAnd when you're in chaos\nUm you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this I'm with a lot of ease because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it and I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some

of course is interested in ... were you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world will make believe [laughter] it's coming true isn't it\nBut what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right 'cause they'll see this kinda shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake\nAnd and then one man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBashing the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the astro planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think it's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain it's just a theory\nThat's pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it are bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't\nReally want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm a of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could but you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um\nOh let me just tell them so I just tell your audience what happened what I'll do it if you want me to George like All right I'll tell them or do we have a couple of minutes yeah oh\nAbsolutely that's the blackout oh I'm Sorry you know when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes so I yeah so I I so how how about I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw the ... man again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what he said how her by name as wrong as I Know the the the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not\nVery nice cheese and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was my extent that but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who was the antagonist and this person's life and mine\nIs my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening\n[laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel is is your in control of what's

[noise] I Do have a picture of my mother whose path um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the book or do um but other than that I don't recognize a
