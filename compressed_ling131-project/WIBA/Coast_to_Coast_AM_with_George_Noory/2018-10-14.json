friend\nAnd you are a lot tonight to try to make sense of just what happened in Michigan yeah I'm not sure that I can but we'll give it a shot\nUh it was not pretty tonight hum and you know what I think both of us if if we're if we're going to be honest with each other and to the audience it's not unexpected yeah you know the score\nAnd score than the fact that they lost ... tried to define this right I I think the score with the way it ended up to me was I was hoping are often to control a Baltimore keep ... off the field all the things you need to have happened to young secondary\nGuys banged up right Scott Nelson sitting out for the first half comes back in and gets hurt pretty much right away other guys getting up but\nWe really needed a strong sense of performance tonight and obviously that didn't happen\nAnd the interesting thing about it too was that the concern from Wisconsin going into this game was not on the defensive side of the ball ... it was on the defensive side of the blog especially when the back again where we had so much inexperienced dealing with the injuries but yet the thirty eight points is that indicative on how well this defense play tonight\nI couldn't get any help from the offer more so in the first half way they get their ... against the wall they held them to a couple of feel goals uh one missed field goal\nAnd you're sitting right in the game and then the second half I think they just started to wear down Michigan got a little journal and go and they got\nFlooded out there running backs based on some of the past routes and receivers that made it a nice job mixing things around but that often so I go on those running back to go into an ... content when they're up that way just to keep pounded at you and that's what we're used to seeing from Wisconsin and [noise]\nAnd we talked about this a little bit during the game but we haven't had that good feeling that we've had control of games uh even from the start with guys healthy so\nThere's a lot of things that they need to be worked on that there are some good things certainly that happened in the game and you can build off of but there was a lot of mistakes and things that need to get corrected Illinois need they play a bit against today like they they will next week is Illinois and and you see that back to back weeks now there's some serious concern with how these guys are progressing\nAnd then you look a little bit further in the schedule they've got a game we know about the Penn State oh yeah that's been circled all your although they lost at home today to Michigan State but you know what now based upon this performance today that road game at West Lafayette against Purdue\nVia scares you as well yeah there there is not from what I saw that there is not an easy game on the rest of the schedule right then and and our guys\nI really thought they made a big jump at the Iowa games the way they finished that game on the road tough environment night game so and so forth I thought they took a big step and today they took it would be going backwards [noise]\nCertainly did so a lot of stuff to get to ... we love to hear from you might calories

or at a chance to talk to one PJ Edwards\nLet's start with knowing that you would be a short handed from a personal standpoint coming into the game tonight in that regard you knew you had to rally in that group work in that regard\nI thought um I thought it back and was just a heck of a job um veggie piercing Eric Brown a wild goose I mean they were all of a show tonight I was really you know happy with how they plan and I thought they had ... and\nJust like all of us and then even when you get a guy back like Scott Nelson early in the second he wasn't a knack for a long and yet so you you guys out there that just hadn't been out there money um and you were talking about they they acquitted themselves pretty well\nYeah I thought like I said before I mean I'm actually losing Scotty as soon as he comes back it's tough for him you know I felt for him with that but um I mean those guys are ready to play and they they knew what was going on\nReally excited for the future for those guys\n... turning points TJ one on ... we assume it's Boston the long run from the quarterback the eighty one yard run um those are momentum changer and what did you see yeah um\n[noise] good scheme

hurts but what what kind of tomorrow will get better so we can do\nEarly third quarter you get a stop in fact you get to stop some of the same dry and they actually punt the ball the way you know those are awful I mean those are killers you have to come back on the field and it's not individual blame but having to come back on on the field when you get a stop is a big deal\nI yeah those things

the\nUh it's it's tough man I think uh\nI don't think it was one of those games where they just flat out beat us is one of those games to where we kinda hurt ourselves and those ones I was in office um but they did a heck of a job of taking advantage of those opportunities but I think the message is is pretty clear you know just look at the film and I'm the only way to go forward you know our sun will rise tomorrow so we have to just keep getting better\nAnd they're truly haven't been many of these ... point differential as one of the rare ones where a fourth quarter you're not really in

the mineral Institute surveyed over sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the ... e training at than than real Institute Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with the the ease remembers wondering if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying\nNursing practice in it for forty or just to go on my website ... dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nThey're kind of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise] a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring fountains as a as a prelude normally\nTo the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent ... hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through colors dial it if you're seeing through your clothes diluted at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you've actually that your body but it'd be injured in the process\nBut most people don't notice because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that\nAre for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that's the dance on it because that happens if I'm over tired I Will switch and I think it's just muscles nerves you're saying\nNow the tiny thing\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\n... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch in animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream began or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc\nIt temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's\nOne of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people\nAre aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and it will be and that question and have you ever tried Dennis and I'm curious how did you hear me now to me\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance\nI had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning\nAnd I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander\nIn these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical\nWorld and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a pass lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say\nEducational lines and\n[noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything like a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe that you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're had\nBeen programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real\nAnd look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience\nSome people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had long lines where I went it was a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he'd written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took on their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone did I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle\nAnd it was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nLooks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nWe can't each other yeah I'd I don't know if that's an adult locked out of body travel less likely mhm\nWell it could have banned but it was it a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there's consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right is to gravity we're used to error you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is actually info dot org you'll find out about all of

love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the ... out of it was lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really they pee owners is is that there's any way to go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much\nAnd um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it was so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere\nBut where did you what was your first experience where we are normal well this is this\nI've been seeing go since I was neat a knee high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not\nMy goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also\nDo some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend ...\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm\nAnd so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community\nNow we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year\nWe tried to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history\nSo even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened and I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do\nAnd interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually published my last book ghosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to die of cancer and how you how you reconnected your life with goats what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nOn ... like humans to my examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while\nAnd about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nHe'd you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is the way through I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything and at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying\nSo she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I feel that a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast that for cell and uh if you that you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first or\nBut her of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you\nWell after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd I'm an artist you know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about it just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest as fate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike wow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on all that just state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know things fall out literally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nSacred places and in these places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious but the hair on my back of my arms and my neck will go up and ... um you can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that\nBecause these magnetic anomaly um Nikola Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as the bird um we're

Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um I think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because\nOriginally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nThey know that all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] needing\nNow had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book yes\nOh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said\nHer job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team because this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes you seem to be the you know like the public is for these ghost\nOf the main thing is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live ... ...\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goals but like other little girls that bounce the ball isn't she do I'm like no\nLeave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you that you've tricks to improve their it's here they are in prison here\nBy their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely big believer in that\nDo you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\n... it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and the oil painter\nHitting lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now haunted or did you met with non hunters salute lead the gas goes follow you\nRight yes they do on like two words it's very funny the I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter] but\nUm that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would go on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them and the streetlights will flash this this

Institute in Virginia and William sounds as they set aside that there is any guide you\nDo these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience it love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the shadow [laughter] thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you still and have a good side he'll\nTell me first of all what led you to even create centrist is ten sets in and out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so\nExplored um and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience\nAnd it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life or the whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience which sounds India's it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a ...\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm now\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that\nWhat I had first stepped into here and ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around if you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you\nTo realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was or not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the [noise] in a sense of ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or a belief system\nMhm I always think you know incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is and apps and he is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was playing because usually not a language
