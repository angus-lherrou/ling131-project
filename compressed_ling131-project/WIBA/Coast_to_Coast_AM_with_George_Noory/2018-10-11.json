Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases\nDifferent parts of the brain are randomly or more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on a different part of the brain this horse really affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors were those diagnosed with Parkinson's easier essential tremors an matter billionaires

great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way to the power of age\nLimit is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn won't come back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading towards the Carolinas or they could see it as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about six piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri\nJesse ... and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor of statistics look at it from the University of California and she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up\nWent up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent ... before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field and what seems to be the case is we can\nShift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make page grow faster\nTo purify water healing somebody of ... to lowering violence and you know of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmacy has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case is thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\n[noise] yeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations [laughter]\nAnd we had the cameras in eight Arab country I was working with a guy like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait\nAnd then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jew\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live\nOver my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world that we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the fate of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arab we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play in in this if you're upbeat and positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide\nAnd so forth of forty foot structure after is he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better you go to the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated\nBut here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid it weren't for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica too is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them\nSo it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to\nTo do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will tell me really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments\nI wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop\nAnd what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes they\nWould have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity so these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctors said step me so that um we looked at other things like\nUh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static prayer they had an identical brainwaves signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sushi master sure my guys were total novices they were students who never even done meditation\nAnd all they had was a twelve minute video for me\nTo do when we're gonna take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of age and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable Lynn Mick Jagger ... linked up for you that coast to coast day uh ... dot com sober other books the bond the intention experiment and\nSign up no go zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com\nWhen you keep us in your play list you stay in control of\nState why be a\n\nWhat's going on rock and roll lovers this anti western I'm going to take you on a journey back to this week in rock 'n' roll history start back in Nineteen fifty seven were Jerry Lee Lewis records great falls a fire in the now famous have hours into the great falls a fire recording sessions\nJerry leave began arguing with stand still of the songs too simple for him to record it's the talk loudly over each other so pleaded with Louis to believe that his knees that could actually be a force awards hot two hundred album charts after record breaking seven hundred and forty one week\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety any better flies from his home in San Diego to Seattle\nWhere he meets his Pearl Jam band mates for the first time it starts a week of recording to become the bulk of their debut album and\nBetter was chosen based on local the added two or three songs instrumental demos that the ban may\nAnd this week in twenty twelve record label bosses at ... am I recall the vinyl anniversary edition of the Beatles single love do after discovering they had accidentally press a version that includes session musician any white plains rounds Ringo Starr copies of the disc featuring the wrong person her report at least\nThe long lines\nWouldn't know rumors\nI Know even in\nOr not and then there\nAre new well on one hand lying in June ...

exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and one in ... and was wanting to do a Web

not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other\nUm mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise] um but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism\nWas the University of California Berkeley\nWho did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve\nIt's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why the middle\nEastern experiment came down and the Arab started you know sending loved to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group\nThat Vegas you're often makes us more tolerant more tolerant people not like a ... so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together when that\nOh that would be ... to ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violent but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a\nBig way next next spring um we're we want people you know of a different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nUs talked about a mirror affect what is that\nWell the mere fact to me with the biggest\nPiece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receiver of the big intention experiment you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiment so when we started giving these teeth experiment I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that [noise] um I felt like I was part of the higher network it my body was shivering and I was you know\nShaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment\nTheir line became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiment we had loads of healing\nWhen we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people make changes their lives being part of that\nLynn we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more

you can even ten for yourself no question and you can\nHave you know you can manifest things definitely I'm not certainly have seen that in my own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my land but the bond about how we are really need the part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were only meant to be in groups we were never\nAnd we were always part but it can be part of the greater home we would never be alone\nAnd I think there's something about that group poured that group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health fear happiness or something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases wait my master classes for instance when I put people in group they're total strangers and they don't meet in person\nThey're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that many of them end up feeling like this is\nA batch of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person and that's the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know\nPraying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities\nWill work for people\nOf certain age brackets assured sections or just a few anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older you\nKnow I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people\nAnd it it works for them I think it's all about using the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things to intend for and how to do it but it also being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called a Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of his in his depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is who worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working\nAnd he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened\nOver the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss wait the it got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung ... better he got a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm\nA special kind of technique and\nEverything in his life with getting better and even his training you know his his um his trainer at the gym and said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know I had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[laughter] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it\nOr ... or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having you know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought\nIs the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear but\nUm as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so we we have this one little power thought saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no we can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it\nAnd so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity but probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about it being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a charge don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe fulfilling the gap and that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes land the gap in a really negative way\nYou know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was a pull McCartney is a second wife um she was he had lost his love of his life Linda his first wife and he was mourning her and he met Heather\nWho had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was the model\nAnd she was the glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost her leg below the knee one of her legs but she's very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who have lost limbs\nAnd that's when Paul McCartney met her now\nHeather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly after pull married her and it fell in love and marriage her you know she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle\nBut I think you know\nWhat ended up happening is as the marriage got sour um\nShe they the British press started digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn um photos and things like this and says simply Heather from being very famous and kind of revered with him and this\nAnd so I look at that case and I think her big problem was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so suddenly\nUnintended consequences that they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so\nIt's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they write a lead of a story they write in an intro they have to do\nWho what when where and why and how\nAnd and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nIf a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want you know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having load\nOh are you in law and that's why you radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen to I hard
