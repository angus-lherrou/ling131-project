share his thoughts with you and uh I understand is going to happen a more frequently you over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be\nThere will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nOr by the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty they will not come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer thing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS\nListening Leslie stall on sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run and I can dent in twenty sixteen the only Democrat\nThat Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now it is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races\nThat will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate just think about two to six years having no federal judge has confirmed anywhere\nIf the Democratic party takes the U.S Senate they will shut down completely\nThey will not work with this president to get anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful\nCompared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight coal and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs saying the ss trunk\nAnd you know and I know and so if you're in one of those contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is\nGo out and vote Republican to keep\nThe house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive ... like in Nevada\nOr Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer

it's the great pyramid all might be more we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream still or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dreams del up a ... most of the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things is there\nIt's like on my news website over a ... goes to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with the your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation\nWhich is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah [noise] um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these are you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker corps\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty three so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these\n... courses and that was it uh it was not supposed to interpret it what does it mean a it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until\nI took a look at it again now how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear\nAnd you know the one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will go out and the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cause me gloom ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is it every ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately it\nUnfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nBecause you know you were you just you know simple mind that I thought that they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed to appear with something called they called ... which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how it conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course no I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that are decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that a bill ... to ... I'm sure a shock to an ... effect create published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in the big tipper it was a star Morocco so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and\nBecause of that because that constellation big secret was so important to chip shows that\nThe authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and we try to preserve it ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the coast to coast and we got to take a break my new is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily Show updates writes your inbox for free was the ... letter signed up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWell I'm Glad I did [noise]\n[laughter] I'm On a October Fifteen what's new today on the free our radio our heart radio\nFor decorating the house or just letting this Gehry move\nPumpkins might be platelets has ... with labor in my life so we've\nTalking about like the fantasy football or soccer jak Joe Rogan experience all your music all your favorite stations\nNext Monday raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male max patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater in\n...

you need to have if you are going to a ... these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right\nBut then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface area that is a round fraction of twenty fifth Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know ...\nAh that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nUh so it is in other words it's associate with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are ... there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yeah yeah of\nCourse we don't know exactly we just it's kind of a the image so I just kind of like you know paint it that into this illustrations just to give up off guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does by news see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back to lead tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the they used the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land a ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go Beckley tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yeah which makes go back leads happy not an accident\nWell within references of course uh with the lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak what authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding

Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question the as we have the supply toe and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original pouring a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that you could\nBring in architects archaeologist perhaps what special theme sub remote viewing him to an intuition and actually reconstruct temples repair the temples have spent discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked\n'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern construction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do as fiction and then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this was on the direction of Peter my new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to\nAh descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel that you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHigh a I had a quick question about the uh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and\nApparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with that I saw you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I have a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do well\nDo you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... while she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the ah the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of a mixed bag\nYou know there's the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then probably there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of sort it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and I\nTo be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monuments so I'm\nWell you're being you're being shaped him political right now we're not I understand that I knew it and I respect that\nYeah I mean there's the other part of this where we had been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction says why are they gonna have to open up are they going to have to back that'll\nYeah so it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot than those Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed a sort of a you know people are even each opposes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA say and they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this is coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\n\nKnees\n\nIn cheese\n[laughter] I've never been seen one new day on the free I our radio we\nThing for decorating the house and we're just letting the theory moon\nMy deeply and you'll drags wouldn't believe or in my life and we've\nDog\nAnd then you'll really an experience all your music all your favorite dishes\nAnd now the hard radio weekends for a time capsule\nSports fans in the last one we can get back to this week in sports history started way back in the ... the first professional golf\nField though one plus one equals boomer effective superb each call one eight hundred five one five zero zero five three or go to ... beach dot com today\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask home advisor home one\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with ... that can do the job nice but how much does it cost ... home advisors totally free to use plus you can reach customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free what's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor at [noise]\nHere's the story of Laura who always wants to play the love of the game\nOr pro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nWas never that good at the bull by the time we go to college but he also learn how to conceive them a lot of money on ... so he didn't say\nThis your story has a happy\nEnding after all\nNews on the WNBA W.

Kush which which is of course ... ... to ... years ago yeah ... ... ... the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago\n... older than any other language you can put a little bowl opponent show ... which was of people who is just big well it's a cush people still you know which ... which of from the coach\nWhich is do you think like who knows what a late it was people along the pilot or\n... ... ... ... ... or ... or ... well\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call\nA minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't buy some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are things that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I sweat I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bummer when we're going back to um meant as a um and the\nFirst and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right\nLike ... and men is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight\nAnd now there's another uh uh uh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now\nI'm more more workers or\nPossibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different title\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse armor and hors ... ... or so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a ... you know the designation\nA net soon vet which is basically referring to operate in Egypt and then came the two lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh as you're just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like ... the is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies or just go to Jay out here in Los Angeles and Jay you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing hello how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um eat chips and on my mom's side [noise] and um growing up as a kid I Would always here [noise]\nMy grandmother said at least they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets or the um the great pyramid has secrets to there's tunnels here oh there you know there's always stories\nGraham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say the one that always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening or any access\nBehind this thing here or on top of the head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw and the back\nSomewhere like that that has access to an insight chamber of this ... of the things that I'm holds or something very dear to humanity that we are uh [noise]\nWe're not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell gee you're in luck because [laughter] man who's been researching some bad ... paper about it so I'm going to it now my new before we get to what's underneath the now the left to front the love from palm\nUh there has been photographs of the top of the banks fried in the ground up or what appears to be I had to roll flight and I have also read a lot of research about\nThe right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this thing's first and possible entrances\nYes so there is a there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a ... there was a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Robert de ... was telling me about this I think or you can there's you can stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the yoga roasted ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charter under the ... and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nLet's go to the international line Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have per minute\nAbsolute owners Richard guys really quickly a notion struck me when you talk to her structured space a look or make it quick a couple of quick jumps laundry\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the trauma ... super big John talking but tempers a farming old knowledge building big golfers structures\nOr who's to say I mean it'd be good to you know I guess people assume that the parents will be a periods are solid but could they not maybe just or just say it's structured spaces be should we be able to look forward\nTo ...\nAnd everything you know arches inside because nobody is like a temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's a jak lead the conclusions that by news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there\nBe more yeah\nSo I I have to you know I've been I Need to have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be the logical and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your review to paper uh but he still thinks it's possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe pyramid of course who it's it's it's hot spaces inside researchers in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know what was your image but in ...

been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nA numerically that is not not in writing but in the in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the months in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monument\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the chickens\nTraits meaning but it's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah\nUm\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north and maybe a something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWe'll let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but there'll be a chamber\nOr something and the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that they could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to our media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in ... uh an and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so\nHow big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big the chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by in height I'm thing right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year scan was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one can show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up\nUm they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph gun to bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that notch\nAnd we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and fire investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYeah the northeast
