{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "Pulling strings and it's just it's stunning how this could have and fall but it probably happened small that by small that it started more simple than that of course but these extra manipulations helped the fungus probably get it how to write into more and that's what led to develop but it's extremely complex\nManipulation but nevertheless is happening\nI can guarantee you that that's happening it's ... it's happening out there and ...\nNow it's kinda crazy it takes about three weeks for the fungus to grow with inside the end and you talk about how I mean it's so crazy how delicate this procedure is because you know aunts live in this colony when they noticed something is amiss in another end sicker stumbling are acting weird\nAnother ... will literally come and take it pick it up and throw it down to its death you know away from the colony protecting the colony\nSo the fungus has to be very careful that it doesn't trigger something weird in the end that it it's going to trigger one of the other answer and suspected of being some type of intruder\nSo how does that work how does the funniest delicately move around this because at the very end as you said when it makes it go by the leaf or the tree branches something that's the point that takes over the brain kind of but before that the end is still operating normally it within the colony yeah\nThat's a really kind of thinking about and you know I don't want to to to short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happened\nTo be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals before they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyway that a path to the end of the fungus or some other sort of disease but the thing that has evolved over many millions of years in ads which then as you mentioned the fungus faster\nThan Kurt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around get somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume when smell a little different than a typical and so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of missing out bad actors\nIn the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get a found out and that would get dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article chew it has to drive the host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms and the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree so you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex because the ant colony is it south extremely complex and able to sniff out this sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball\nTo avoid detection and really pull off this\nStunningly complex devious manipulation\nThat's how we get the zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process in infiltrating the colonies and even half the time it right the you know the fungus as a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colonies that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think uh we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ... to bite onto the pain of ally that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened\nHere in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is the fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the ban of relief but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch\nThat it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a purge it's easier to get a purchase on\nThe vein of elite biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states is as the fungus there's ordering the aunt to bite onto the flag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that stamp and that's just\nAll the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because\nIn the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually develops over the course of a year and it will over winter just sitting there on the stem biding his time and then once the spring comes around it will then finally arrived at the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin that day you have the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the\nMany many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species so worms do it to crickets their war or to the crickets the jump into water which is not of course great for the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then made\nAt a particular kind of manipulation rabies actually is a very well known\nParasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so\nThe book is about the wide range of parasites the\nReally incredible range of parasites more than you'd ever imagine that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique ways whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering\nStructures in the brain so it's called by living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration hope is very strange kingdom species that are really ruining the days of their house\nJust reading about the ants in of itself is so interesting so thank you very much Matt Simon staff writer at wired author of plight of the living dead check out the book thank you for

with the latest\nWith a retirement plan or and I'm not talking about the broker that got you to retirement a most brokers are just focused on growing your assets and selling you investments\nA retirement plan or on the other hand is going to take a holistic picture of where you're at and teach you how to transition into retirement and the very first step is just that first appointment and for the first ten callers today\nWe're going to walk you through what we call the Madison money guy five steps worry free retirement analysis which is really that check up if you will normally I charge a fee for that but if you're one of the first ten colors that six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred there'll be no cost\nBut in order to qualify for our offer you have to be one of the first ten callers and you must have accumulated two hundred fifty thousand dollars or more now if this was you please pick up the phone call six zero eight\nTwo zero eight Eighteen hundred again we call it the Madison money guy five staff worry free retirements analysis first time caller is right now it's six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred\nChristian we're talking about this risk of out living your savings and just making a point that\nPlanning is really the factor here I mean ... planning is the difference between having to rely on friends and family members or whomever to help you get through retirement and having insurance of getting it on your own any it really that significant difference would you say\nYeah absolutely no listen when times are good and they've been really good for the last nine years in fact argue believe we've never had a better nine year period of time and it seems like the markets are going to keep going up there is a lot of really positive things happening economically but there's also an extrovert\nMary danger of having another big recession in fact you know we all know what goes up must come down and the reality is this in the most to refund really significant market corrections obviously the most recent one being two thousand and eight and nine and then prior to that was nearly two thousands\nYes the market recovered in fact historically the market always recovers\nKnowing the most to recent corrections it took five years for that recovery but but think about this\nYou were working during those five years and most of you hopefully did the right thing and that is don't sell at the bottom of the problems and there's a lot of do it yourself people are acting emotionally and selling it the wrong time but most importantly you kept making contributions\nAnd so the difference now is you're much closer to retirement for some of you you're already retired so if we have a significant pulled back like that again you're not taking advantage of buying those stocks at a discount\nAnd even more importantly many of you are dependent on the income from your portfolio so you're forced to take distributions all the way down\nSo yes it is that significant having a retirement plan or\nCan be the difference to success or failure as it relates to you in ever running out of money and a significant risk of market pullback\nMight not be any greater than it is today now I Am absolutely not saying to take all of your money out of the market in fact we help our clients well with a lot of money in the market but what we want to help you understand is how much risk\nCan you afford to take what kinds of calculations and what would the impact to be if we experienced a condition like that\nAnd I don't even believe Jen I'm actually quite optimistic on the economy I don't think we're going to see a fifty percent pulled back like we did in two thousand and eight but even at twenty percent a correction today and then on top of that if you think about the balance of your accounts\nThere's more four O. one K. millionaires today than ever before and chances are if you did the right thing during the last correction\nYou have more money today than you've ever had so a twenty percent correction today would cause a much larger dollar amount last minute twenty percent loss in the future and then what would the rebound look like how long will it take\nAnd so it is absolutely vital that if you were at or near retirement planning in fact if you're five maybe ten years away from retirement or perhaps you recently retired here within five to ten years of that retirement date\nOn the other side is absolutely important that you get a second opinion on your portfolio and this should be by somebody that focuses a hundred percent of their efforts on retirement income planning\nAnd for the first ten callers on today's show as long as you have accumulated two hundred fifty thousand dollars or more all you have to do is be one of the first ten callers at six zero eight\nTwo zero eight Eighteen hundred against six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred now here's what's gonna happen if you call my team today somebody's going to take your name and number if you're one of the first ten people and then a member of my team will follow up on Monday morning\nAnd we will then connecting and figure out how to get you in to see me so

staff will call you Monday morning and get you all lined up to come in for the Madison money guy five step worry free retirement analysis again the number to call it six zero eight two zero eight

I I'm Jen read alongside Christian ... he's the founder of retirement income strategies\nThey're located in Evansville but they do have a couple of satellite locations in Madison in Brookfield as well Madison money guy dot com is the website if you'd like to learn more and also encourage you to check out the events tab on the website they always have something going on and you can find out what's next by checking at that\nEvent tab on Madison money guy dot com\nChristian we're talking about the risks to your retirement income today there are a lot of them some of them seem very obvious stock market risk losing money and our investments but some of them do you sneak up on us a little bit more maybe we don't realize\nThe tax implications or what we will oh on taxes and are different accounts that one of those risks\nYeah I think tax risk is one of the most significant risks going forward and for the future and for a lot of reasons number one we have a deficit that is just absolutely out of control and the government just keeps extending that and really kicking the liability down the road in fact\nThere is some argument today that our deficit is twenty times greater than the next closest country ... and our deficit is now a grown farther it's growing faster than our GDP is and so\nIt is an extraordinarily risk and when we add on top of that the danger that exist within Social Security and Medicare ... in my opinion is just a tax torpedo waiting to happen\nAnd many families that I sit with Jen they've really quite frankly they've done it the wrong way now no fault of their own they did what you know the so called experts told them to do but when I think about tax planning\nI'm always trying to talk to people about the three tax buckets and if you think about your money or your life savings or your investments they can fall into one of three tax buckets there's the tax now bucket this is your taxable accounts anything that you receive a ten Ninety nine for every year this is typically the money in your bank accounts\nAny CDs and a taxable mutual fund account perhaps you inherited some bonds from your grandma you've got some stocks again anything you're paying taxes on every year\nI'm also a member of an organization called the American tax planning Institute and they focus specifically on how to legally ethically morally this inherent the IRS from your life savings and many times it's by being very charitable with your money or a structure and your assets just a little different than you may have thought\nI'm constantly out there ... trying to keep my finger on the pulse of what's happening in the not only the environment and the landscape of the investing world but what are the products and solutions but also what does the IRS tax code look like today\nAnd we've just taken a different approach her retirement come strategies not only do we customize the plant to the client but we do comprehensive planning and that means that we have to understand the estate planning world and partner with attorneys and\nUnderstand the tax planning world a partner with CPAs and understand income world and understand the income products available and the risk world and use different tools that in a life that so it makes my job extraordinarily challenging but it's what I Love to do with my passion is my purpose\nI Would say if you were at or near retirement planning age\nYou probably need a new advisors somebody that focuses on retirement as opposed to growth and accumulation and the good news for you is if you're one of the first ten callers today it won't cost you a single penny to come in and get a portfolio analysis we call it of course the Madison money guy five step worry free retirement analysis\nAnd for the first ten cars today at six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred there'll be no cost\nNow you must have accumulated two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more to take advantage of this offering call my office right now six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred\nChristian ... is the founder of retirement income strategies in Evansville I'm generally jak alongside an idiot to another re\nRetirement income than he has the money I returned\nYou could still again from the gardening company where you are in one day roofing company\nThat's right when they call the troop professionals at the guy company today's age three for ... for eight or find this on line and the gardener code that time\nWere thanks for being with us today that his retirement in ... and the money I mean\nYou're alongside Christian ... most of you know the drill when you go to the doctor you know the kinds of questions they're going to be asking you understand some of the different health risks and health\nConditions that are out there and you might have some\nCommonsense ways to address them but so few of us have that when it comes to our money Christian we're talking about some of these different financial risks as part of our financial checkup what about inflation to me that seems like one that just doesn't matter a whole lot that maybe that's just my stage of life\nNo I think you are I wouldn't say it's a state of life I think it's the common perception from everybody because it's it's the invisible killer it's the silent killer we can't see it\nBut again as I talked about earlier Gen if we go back in time and think about how much things cost us you know I like to call it the good old days and so you know often in fact I'll I'll ask our listeners how much with gasoline in Nineteen Seventy think for a second and remember when you pull up in Nineteen Seventy somebody who maybe it was your first car even driving for a while well the answer\nIs it was twenty seven cents a gallon according to the department of energy a Nineteen Seventy gasoline was twenty seven cents a gallon but they'd run out of the the filling station they pump it for you [laughter] they wash your windows they Arab your tires and life was good in fact I have a client that I remember years ago I used to go back in the olden days when I Would go to clients' home\nShe shared with me a plate collection or where she she got a gift for filling up and all that many of my listeners today can relate to this and so how much of gasoline today just gasoline alone right it's about two dollars and thirty four cents a gallon or or think about your first house how much did you pay\nFor your first home right in Nineteen Seventy two the average home was thirty two thousand dollars oh\nChristian I'll deal on better my grandparents their first home costs twelve thousand\nDollar on believable again it's often like a game of prices right right and you start thinking about what we play and and so often I'll have clients that you know have a price for him so I I Would be willing to bet many of our listeners today you paid more for the car you're driving in right now\nThan you did your first home and so so things are getting more expensive all we have to do is think about what are things going to cost in the future\nAnd the unfortunate reality as for the last ten years or so inflation has been artificially low in fact if we look at the statistics it's been about one and a half to two percent now historically over the last hundred and four years inflation of average about three and a half percent\nAnd so just at that normalized inflation rate the cost of living will double\nEvery twenty three years and the reason this is a big deal Jen is that many people will live longer than twenty three years in retirement ... and so that means that if it costs you if you could get by today on a half a million dollar portfolio if that would satisfy your income needs\nIt'd be a million dollars to do the same thing twenty three years from now and so one of the fears for retirees Gen as they want to take all of their money out of the market they want to go right from the market to safety and the answer is probably not to do that we have to think about diversification\nKnow diversification is not the end all get all it's not the permanent solution to everything but it is a great way to not only has risk but to help you uh keep pace with the cost of living going forward\nChristian as we talk about inflation and how to plan for it and prepare for it and there's something we can out save or do we really need to consider some other strategies\nYou know listen I Would love for somebody to come in here and be able to tell them you've just saved twice as much money if you're ever going on I don't normally see it I think overwhelmingly Americans are under prepared for retirement actually\nI pulled up some statistics are for the show today Jen in one of the statistics that I read said that the average\nAmerican retirement account\nIs only about five thousand dollars\nYou know think about that the average American retirement account is only five thousand dollars now we've got to be careful with this statistic because this is counting every single retirement account whether you're Eighteen or Seventy but I Would say some some better statistics that I remember reading says that it's around fifty thousand when whether it's five thousand or fifty thousand\nMost people are going to need more than a million dollars and so saving is probably not the best way to do this but if you think about diversification\nNow we've all heard the term diversification and it it's very basic core it simply means don't put all of your eggs in one basket\nBut I Want to take that a little bit further certainly there's asset diversification and historically most of you if you look at your portfolio this is what you think you've been doing in fact you meet with your broker and she tells you hey we're really diversified right we've got stocks bonds and cash maybe they threw in a variable annuity maybe there's some missile bonds and the portfolio\nBut at the end of the day you for the most part have stocks bonds and cash you've got some mutual funds are in fact most people that's all you have is mutual funds and so even if you have bonds there bond mutual funds which are traded in the equity market\nBut I'm saying let's take this a step further even if we want to talk about an asset diversification there's more assets than just stocks bonds and cash in fact there's an entire universe\nOf what we would call alternative investments and that's when we get into things like commercial real estate floating fixed income a bank loans natural resource expiration private equity there's an entire universe of additional assets that are typically only restricted and reserved for the ultra wealthy\nAnd I'll listen to some of these aspect classes you do have to be a millionaire to get access to that but but on many of them as long as you have at least\nTwo hundred fifty thousand dollars we can at least explore the world of alternative investments in alternative investments are certainly not perfect in fact every single asset\nHas advantages disadvantage as an strings attached and oftentimes with an alternative investments we might be giving up liquidity and that's why you need to work with a skilled advisor that knows everything\nAbout your financial situation so they can recommend the exact amount so you're not over allocated and you don't have concerns about liquidity needs if things don't go that well\nBut there's additional options for investments or an inflation or diversification it's not just asset diversification we also talked about bucket diversification what bucket of money is doing what\nAgain most people just don't know what they don't know in the very first step is meeting down with a skilled license financial planner that focuses primarily on retirement income planning\nAnd so for the first time caller is on the today show as long as you have accumulated two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more all you have to do is be one of the first ten callers at six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred against six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred\nIf you're one of the first time caller today we're going to give you the Madison money guy five step worry free retirement analysis that's my proprietary process to analyze everything that you've done and help us identify any potential problems based on what you\nWant to accomplish in retirement\nAgain all you have to do is be one of the first ten callers at six zero eight two zero eight Eighteen hundred\nChristian what about increases and volatility and the potential of some sort of downturn that's another one that just seemed out of our control\nYeah absolutely and again another reason diversification is so important now we talk a lot about the stock market and the stock market is certainly important we believe some of your assets should be in the stock market uh for many people that number it's it's very different it's unique to your own situation it's based on your age\nIt's based on your risk level it's based on when you're going to retire how long you expect your retirement to last\nIt's based on so many different things but there are other assets that are what we call non correlated assets meaning they're not necessarily dependent", "show_name": "Madison Money Guy", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "06"}
