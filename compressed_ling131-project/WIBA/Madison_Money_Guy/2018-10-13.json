I have four kids of course you know the same parents but\nTheir personalities their insurance just everything about them is so different and easier for people who live in the same house and\nYou know ... it just makes me think about how so many different and unique people are coming to you and\nThis is why you spend the time you spend it getting to know all of your clients and getting to know what they want to do because I have four kids you have two kids who are in the same household and they have such different needs is right that's why you can't do this one size fits All right\nNo no it's so true and that you're you're and you're always you have a knack of these analogy [laughter] it's in it's in a you know it's it's funny 'cause that that really is my message to people as well so when I'm you know I'm Talking to prospective clients I'm saying there there is no one size fits all you know they yeah that's exactly right and people often ask me you know like\nI I speak a lot of my church and so and I've I've created sort of a financial ministry\nIn my church and and part of me doing that as saying I respectfully ask that these families do not become clients because I Want them to have the opportunity to get education for me with with literally no strings attached I Want this just to be true financial education so I get all kinds of crazy questions\nAnd often it's you know what should I be investing in and and how much do I need to retire in and and the reality is it it really does depend everybody's situation is so drastically different\nAnd that's why we believe so strongly here at retirement income strategies on comprehensive retirement planning and and that's what makes us unique in fact there's there's three things that really make us unique\nThe first thing is that we work with people that are at or near retirement right and we're we're no longer generalists we work specifically with people who are within five to ten years of retirement than they are now mostly focused on preservation and income\nAnd the second thing that makes us unique is that we do customized planning so it's it's cost them to your situation we spend time with you learning what you want to accomplish what what are your concerns how much income do you need specifically ah how long does that half the last what are your biggest goals objectives and mostly concerns\nAnd then the third thing that makes us different is that we don't have to answer to any one\nCompany or anyone brokerage firm or any one insurance company I don't have a sales manager telling me\nWhat tools I have to use for my clients so I'm I'm legitimately looking at my client's situation and then looking at the entire universe of available options\nAnd so uh if if you if our listeners if you find yourself in that category if you're at or near retirement planning agent and now's the time for you to get a second opinion or somebody to look at your portfolio and say\nYou know are you ready is this what you had the thought that was going to be happening and and if you're already retired is this going to last you if we experienced another two thousand and eight type stock market correction\nAnd if the answer is ah you're ready for that second opinion I Would encourage you to take advantage of my offer a and that is if you're one of the first ten callers on the today show or to call my office I'm

through linked in also lots of great information that Christian and his team are sharing\nDue to social media outlets as well a Christian and what what I Want to talk about in this part of the show is\nReally just getting the most bang for your buck um it's it's one of those things I I don't know if you're a big you know coupon person or wish I\nWas you know I I sometimes I just don't like messing with it I'm just like it's too much trouble for fifty cents or whatever but but you know when we are looking at something bigger it something like our savings something like our investments\nWe can miss out on some value if if we don't know really what we're doing or we don't fully understand the fine print right that's\nRight that's right no so it's like that conversation we just had a about tools and under saying there's a lot of tools and and I'm back to that saving money category I I actually wish I took the time and I was organized enough to clip coupons [laughter] here here in Evansville which is where my main offices that we've got to pay quickly\nAnd they have what they call the pig weekly card and I never have my card but I always give 'em my phone number and it seems like every time\nI save a few bucks and ... yeah I always get excited like I like saving money\nWhen it comes to retirement planning it it can be thousands of dollars quite frankly it can be tens of thousands of dollars and not only savings on the internal fee structure once you fully understand what the actual cost\nOf but most importantly it can be tens of thousands of dollars of income right in some scenario it can be hundreds of thousands of dollars in income over your lifetime wow they if you don't if you don't have the right tools or maximize these tools are most importantly put all of these tools together\nIn a comprehensive plan and that's the benefit of having a plan that we've talked about and so it's the drawback of thinking specific\nAbout a tool and one of the most widely miss understood tools are annuities yes right maybe maybe one of the most popular retirement tools for obvious reasons that we can discuss but certainly one of them were misunderstood and\nAnd I'm not certain exactly where the misunderstanding come from I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that most annuities are being sold by salespeople and typically they working in the company that only has one a lot of times it's a really expensive really risky one type of an annuity and so people they automatically generalize\nAnd as you and I talked earlier Gen we talked about our children and how different they are and in my family I have two daughters and they came from the exact same parents they live in the same household\nYet they're drastically different people and so if if people here in town all they thought about was the ... and they they categorize the ... one way of all they knew was my oldest daughter\nWho they're going to be shocked when they meet my youngest daughter because they had either completely different\nUh in the same is true in the in the financial planning world and specific tools and mostly with annuities because the complication with annuities Janice there's over five different types of annuities\nAnd there's hundreds of insurance companies that manufacture these annuities and typically they're being sold for some of these bells and whistles that in most circumstances really don't provide a lot of value to the client anyways but they cost a lot of money to get them\nAnd so one of the benefits of working with an independent financial planner that doesn't work for any one company or maybe more importantly any one world of money being the insurance world or the wall street world or the banking world\nIs that advisor certainly what we do hear a retirement income strategies is we are going to create a financial plan first and then we're going to talk about potential tools and in if we discuss annuities\nWe're going to talk about the five different types of annuities we're going to talk about the advantages of each of those five types of annuities and we're going to talk about the disadvantages\nMost importantly we're going to talk about the strings attached\nBut when we talk about an annuity we are going to tell you specifically why this particular one is a fit for your plan and only if it is because ... the reality is for many people in annuity might not be a good fit it all well\nAnd and that's what's so many people don't always understand and and the other thing Christian as as you were talking about some of the assumptions maybe people make especially as it relates to oh these are all the same\nI think that sometimes the more expensive\nSomething is you just assume it's a better age is running the quality is better and that that might be the case in some things but that doesn't mean we want to go for the most expensive higher fee type products because that doesn't necessarily make it better for us right\nNow no end in in in many cases certainly in the world of annuities it it not only does it make it better it could potentially make it worse because of lack of performance but but on that same topic of what's really interesting is is many of us do think that the more expensive something is the better it must be but for some reason\nI think as society in general and consumers a consumer behavior has shifted so much in the last five and ten years you know I mean think about the way we buy things most people want it as fast as possible and it's cheapest possible\nAnd so when it comes to retirement planning that's another really broad categorization I think people get as they always want to know what's the cost\nAnd it's too generic to answer because at this point I have no idea what we're going to use yeah and every single too has an option but but I always try to focus on the fact that price is only the issue absent value\nAnd so if you have a customized plan that drive an enormous amount of value that accomplishes every goal that you hope to have happened were able to get you the income you need and want to retirement you're able to pass a inheritance to your children at a tax efficient manner were able to eliminate probate concerns and tax issues upon death\nOr in some cases I Would suggest what what does it matter what the prices but as an independent plan or we want you to know the price but most importantly we want you to be able to make a determination on value and understanding even again as it goes back to the world of product and as we're talking about annuities\nA lot of them have no cost but maybe not a lot of value some of them have cost and it might have value maybe maybe it has value for particular scenario I find this a lot especially in the world of annuities in fact I just met with a couple this last week my first face to face visit\nAnd they had three variable annuities and their understanding\nOf what these variable annuities did was very different than the reality of what they did in fact we called the company together during our first meet him because I knew that what they thought was going to happen with these products was not possible\nTalking today with Christian ... he's the founder of retirement income strategies I'm generally jak along side in the studio Madison
