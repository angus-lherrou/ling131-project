{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "Touched so many lives so many families so many neighborhoods that are this letter sort of for me this stills and says better than what I could say because\nThankfully blood I Am not a father who has lost a child to this insidious addiction and yet Chris has an a gift a blessing if you will that he can articulate\nWhat that meant to him and his family's journey in dealing with someone who has this malady and for that\nI Am determined to be the Johnny Appleseed for those who don't have a bully pulpit like I Do to say that for those who say we should sort of let Darwin's survival of the fittest that somehow we should be more efficient\nAnd let those who make bad choices or die by those natural consequences of their actions\nI say no a thousand times you know we cannot go to that dark place with that sort of callousness and insensitivity\nFor the fragility of life that all of us know and all of us have with some member of our family and this is just one context where I'm pushing back in with versus a kindness allowing me to use Molly vicariously as a mechanism for hopefully others well you know and I\nWhen when the chief read the letter I mean I've never heard or read before but I Know and I I read it this morning I haven't read it since I gave it to him in that letter I foreshadowed exactly what we did two weeks ago and and and I can say that\nWith some composure today and I'm just saying because I'm a person to face and I believe that that whatever the lord has in mind whatever as well as a accepted but anybody who's listening this isn't a religious program but if you read loop twelve twelve you know I didn't write that\nIf I can express it in a way that helps achieve help other officers understand was compassion\nThe struggles of the people that they might just want to say forget it I'm just gonna go clock out and get a coffee okay I'm ... and for city council members we have great city council and county people they have funded a lot of this but but when we took this on this past two weeks has passed Fortnite\nIn her obituary it's sort of a\n... it's the next stage and and the chief has my permission I don't think I've told them and still now he can now user net and you can talk about her because a lot of people know the name van Wagner probably some don't speak as nicely about that now that she has um I'm sure there are some people who would like to see my obituary\nUm I've ... I've gotten those emails chief so have you come on and I you know we we all love it but we we do this for a reason and I I this is not my job I'm a lawyer and and I'm also a father and I'm also a husband and I'm serving a God and it is my hope\nThat by telling the story candidly that how person don't don't fool yourself don't say oh they're looking good they are doing better don't believe them\nGet them help talk to them tell them you love them draw hard lines but get them help and tell them there's help available in this county more than anywhere Madison could be the model for the country maybe it is but they at least here that and they have a chance and this save in twenty fourteen and then another one last November third\nI heard of gratitude and I heard also that that was heartbreaking for me and hearing that I heard hope\nWell ... ... the case\nAnd I I could almost you know feel your whoa they saved her and the you gave us our crew and it's frustrating that but you got to keep ... keep on with\nYou know two women don't get out to women friends of Mali in main message me and said Molly talked openly if we struggle with heroin and it helped me get sober and even though she didn't make it\nThe fact that she stayed alive helped to people whose names I'll leave out of this discussion they're still here and they're beating her addiction so it that's all we want that's all I Want to do\nWell and also in your also another thing you're doing here Chris you and your family I'm ah in the obituary for my instead of a ... in lieu of flowers yes for donations to help pay for ... for Madison lease and that has been well received hasn't not\nWell it has almost as to tell you a I mean I I Wish I could have a call your campaign show for that [laughter] goodness gracious the largest of the donors are already in the thousands and that's going to make an impact and God Bless the that in the throes of a death\nThat somehow that will create a legacy of life for others to get that second or third or fourth chance whatever\nWell chief somebody went and got money for three hundred doses of nasal narcan twenty fourteen and somebody spent six weeks training sergeant Jeff ill notice how to use it and I understand that the cost of adults today to the city of Madison is thirty seven dollars and fifty cents I Know that in excess of six thousand dollars has been donated and\nYou know some people might say well that's not a whole lot of money and they might use the same you might use that on one person in a week no ... is that tells me that ... that this hit a nerve people do understand that and they do see a donation of twenty five or fifty dollars to this particular\nCause as a way to well I guess you know officer Aubrey put it best she's such a life affirming choice as to those donations and then we from the three and a half almost four years we had was Molly because of the narcan and again last fall which\nI'm was that you know difficult but not shocking and and maybe another family loved ones will have three or four more years with them or maybe beat it and you in last week's program asked me you know when you reach your should reach thirty you start sink or out of the woods yeah well you know\nSomebody might get out of the watch because of somebody's fifty dollar donation and if that happens as a whole lot better than a set of wilted flowers and so if that helps that's great\nThat's going to tell you that just knowing the Chris is families Peggy and and other lovely children I'll I'll tell you though it it certainly stands as a very clear unequivocal message\nIf it can happen to this literally this I still like family has everything all the opportunities all the upside all the trajectory for success none of us are him you none of us and that's why we have to take this is our teachable moment\n... ... I Want to say that but I also you know I Want to tell the chief said that everybody presents on Facebook on the show show media and in life the way to put your best foot forward you don't lead with your problems nobody wants to live with Debbie Downer but\nThe idea like family that he described I Will tell you we're so dysfunctional as [laughter] that there are friends of my children who offered to pay a monthly basis to join our family group text but in that group text we address this I don't\nKnow you have to and the friends we occasionally do let them in there on it they know and we hope that somebody's inspired to confront their loved one and say\nI Love you I don't want to get you help to only can hundreds no there's no shame [noise]\nThere is no shame in addiction I Wish I could call to joke from George Carlin and my wife always says the George Carlin citizen funny that you tell somebody of cancer and I feel sorry for him to passionate about give you a hug and you tell them you have an addiction and they punch in the nose or that's not the joke is much better than that but that's it people need to remember that it's not always the choice when you're addicted\nAnd I get that but you know just a ... critics say well it should be ashamed because we don't want to encourage that behavior\nI again there will always be those advocates of believing in the public shaming if you will\nI'm a ... that would assume that you have the intent the will and the sort of looking at the statutory elements of a crime that your pre meditating too are predisposed to make victims around you\nAnd I think what that fails to embrace the fact that when you have an addiction you're not making those rational choices of pre meditation and intend to do harm to people\nYou're harming yourself and certainly you're going to ultimately harm others if you get behind the wheel of a car or whatever\nBut they're facing the natural consequences and quite frankly if we hope to stem the tide\nI Know it's a little unconventional for police chief to say this but I really think we have to think as a community about a paradigm shift\nAnd that if we think we're going to lock up these people\nAs a mechanism for keeping them out of sight out of mind out of harm's way and make them be punished were not ever going to get to the root cause\nAt the jail can't treat him they're not equipped to deal with these addictions we have to look at these as a disease model and with a disease model you don't continue the punitive sanctions you had those natural consequences which flow\nBut I really think it has to be a sense of shifting our focus to a treatment modality rather than only worrying about extracting a punishment\nAll right and uh our our time is gone and I thank you both so much uh especially uh Chris for sharing your story and to the loss of Mali\nA thank you for letting me Robin yes a added that to part program we've had here on Madison for men of course chief that's always the planes rabbit and joins ... thank you Chris you've been listening to Madison\nThought were the stories of\nSell you why BA in my heart radio station\n[noise]\nFlight caravans I'm Pam who sell Fox News that charge from\nPresident Trump who says Democrats are openly inviting illegal immigrants to violate our borders they as as a caravan of about two thousand migrants crosses into Mexico from Guatemala\nIs within a designated patrolling area\nNight scope or the makers of the road but they say that\nThe data secure and it's only seen by the security controlling the robot they're able to stop it and tell us what to look for but nice scape says they can't follow a specific person [laughter] yeah right okay the company says it caused between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just stripped down for parts\n[noise] or when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers\nNow have a drone accessible to them that's right and twenty sixteen drone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX\nBut what does that collision has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer that he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of loony am twenty plane and then a drone\nWas a DJ I've fandom to quad copped or it's two point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could actually handle so the banter wasn't certain to forty foot cannon relieved at a speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour\nIt hit point zero three seconds later and although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoons for chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video can actually see\nThe drone go into the aircrafts wing explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the wing to damage its\nMain weight bearing spar and other words the aircraft would crash\nAnd let's now turn to something even more frightening yes Facebook that's right I told you last week about the new Facebook video camera and microphone\nIt looks like like a mini tablet it's a a home assistant they say it's going to compete against Google Home apples home pot and Amazon elects and Facebook called their hardware the Porto ... why would anyone\nTrust Facebook enough to put a Facebook powered microphone and video camera in their living room or kitchen I mean you just look at Facebook's history of lack of privacy they don't care anything about our security so the Web site Recode actually wrote that on their site I'm going to read it to you\nKnow data collected through Porto even called log dead or app usage data like the fact that you listen to spot a fight will be used to target users with ads on Facebook\nA year right okay they say they wrote that because that's what they were told by Facebook executives are you ready here's the shocker\nThe data about who you call the data about which apps you use what you do on this portal\nWill be used to target you with ads on Facebook and other Facebook own property so yes Facebook yet another data stream where it's advertising targeting business which is where you again or the product\nYou buy this and as I like to say you really are a schmuck her Burke\n[noise]

to waste you either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but\nYou didn't I didn't\nHave an acquaintance chew recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in the very when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born in ... and the people in his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she was like a no avail I failed miserably\nOh man so you're gonna wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old so she's Twenty years old and that's right 'cause you said Nineteen Ninety eight um\nYou couldn't really find anything about her leg on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a a Facebook account that looked like it had ... origins a January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social you know not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your\nFriend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or actually is going to scam ham or what all\nAll of the above okay uh she does it for for money or they're not rich by any means ah ah the family just ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family\nSo I'm sure and then all of a sudden you have kids coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I don't just a bystander and all that [noise] [noise] well here are good friend I mean you're worried about

lot but I used to ... dot com yeah ... ... [noise] uh and I'm coming up with\nIt you know there's also family tree now where okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad\nSo you really need to keep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer a glass of wine okay this is Jeremy click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to attract but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman\nIs that you know I'm ...\nIs that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you can then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start stupid around and see if there's anything else out there\nYeah I don't think he wants anybody ... oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that the that she is his daughter and I don't think she's got a very good background and I think she's just to get which it can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know or whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nA and maybe you know he needs to text you every

the podcast that we put together this week it's called DNA detective maybe wondering what the heck of a DNA detective\nWell if you or someone you know there were diagnosed with cancer you know you you

doing I'm good what's going on for a well a\nFirst before you the question I shall which you know I wouldn't say thank you for keeping company and my drive home from work you're all she has a big question is whether they just went through a pretty nasty divorce and he's got a young son who as men were thrown my brother is an apple we'd actually knew Android in\nThe ... research a good track or so he knows where his son is when he doesn't have custody\nUm 'cause he's he's ... he's a little concerned that his white white before the\nI don't know do various ... okay I get what you want your website and there's a tracker on there it's a free one that it\nIt's sort of the website it up to ... hours and there was a notation saying that if you wanted to you know paper one there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might recommend well here's easy\nOh no it's just that you know so here's the deal is that you know he the the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] I mean that's another issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending upon the carriers of ... do you know who the carrier is a believe that she came all okay if the mobile has a to 'em because he's probably play paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if you pay for the kids phone okay\nIs that the carriers they also they have something like family located or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\nTen okay and if the if he had you know his grandparents\nWhere he want to even uh normally you can have up to ten people on a plan or a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y.\nM. P. S. say glimpse and Clinton glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the tea mobile website looked at their family ... like I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly and paying somebody and it's not look at that glimpse program that claim sap rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for your call Chris and\nThanks for letting me keep company there on the way home stay right where you are we going to talk about how you can get copies of all the data that apple and Google has on you you're on the Kim commando show\nOver the years that apps and has earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean when you experience the economical absent eco tank forty seven fifty this is a fantastic wireless all in one printer it's my partner choice because it's cartridge free\nAnd comes up to two years I think right in the box enough to print up to eleven thousand counter pages\nThat's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge set the bar and a run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that it would cost me around Fifteen hundred dollars was ego tank you easily refill the printers ain't tanks and second\nTank is a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free it's available everywhere more information at ... dot com slash eco tank camp and for a limited time through November first\nGet free overnight shipping when you use to promote called eco tank came I check out when you buy any eco tank printer\nOffer valid within the forty a contiguous states exclusion supplies subject to availability\n... ... don't weigh register online at only ... minutes\nFrom my family planning part of a lesson for five of them some of that on top of your life so\nAnd so hard or at a start up with money from Tokyo showed off a robot that can pick up toys and can pick up close up the floor and put them in their proper places yes\nThey're going to sell these robots I could clean up the dirty plays the dishwasher these objects through built in ...\nFarmers overtime at wanders around the house takes an inventory of all the household possessions\nOr they say maybe all these robots could help keep the kids entertain so they wouldn't be on the X. box or the pet anymore and I know what you're thinking sure I mean I could totally arid without screen time I could also turned my own butter but let's not get crazier [noise]\nAll right if you or someone you know as a reader there's a new kitten do paper white that's out of the big deals as you can now take your Kindle and you can read when you're taking a bath that's right so if you drop it in the motor it still works Amazon says the new readers the fitness lightest Kendall paper way to ever\nSix inches three hundred people by where free display or the lighting now ten percent brighter than before and as I mentioned it's waterproof\nIt can be in water for up to an hour at six and a half feet deep at I.

simple to find an easy charging station or electric charging station well things have changed Google Maps now in Iowa as the Android you can now have the nearest fill up spots show up on a map if you need an ... charge those things show you buy the station would type of plugs charging speeds other business details\nA and so if a business has a charging station available by the way that's going to be lifted too so again if you need and ... they charge you want to update Google Maps\nOn Iowa west an Android [laughter] All right I ran across an interesting\nStory over at the wall Street Journal this past week\nAnd the title was you want twenty percent for handing me a muffin the awkward\nEtiquette of I had a thing and I don't\nKnow if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their eye pad or on their phone\nIs that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I don't want to name a possible I don't out if possible sponsor a future sponsor so I'll just say there's a place it is called but narrow Brett [laughter]\nTalking and code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of ... era I developed the seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you well if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going\nTo do that if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay ... pay a farmer's market\nI bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for business and what I Love about in the coal is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age to have this type of business at command as something\nShe uses square okay [noise] and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put it in the middle that's what people are going to tip\nAnd there'll be a certain percentage\nThat will that you can guilt them into going to you know the third call it which is really the goal of all business foods that people have more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so\nYou know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and they you know and they're trying to get they need new you know they're getting ready for college and they're cheekbones looking really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be I said seriously\nResearch has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty per cent on just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nAnd see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are going like thirty percent\nBut the ... isn't that different though because that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great so when you're at the narrow do you tip\nYeah really\nI Do that where they keep asking 'cause people like you keep thinking well here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston click and when you\nWill eat table and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at that so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register\nOh of course you want but a bad but at ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires in it and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's and I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something and they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they

something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband ... just because we have\nThat's it and they\nAre they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is helping with us\nForty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car and\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you've got everything in this way everybody has the picture\nAnd um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half\nYear and so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been serving\nThe great things I mean every day's an adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have\nA full size of a refrigerator Airbus and\nIf you decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we're going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard or was that we have to take out the side when does it take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it off and it\nWas it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question that I bet you're you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids grow up and some of my early days ranchers which I don't know if I Want everybody to see what we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stir obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F.

for anybody in the area to get a hold a bus to come on and see us\nOn the show we focus on retirement retirement planning Jeff that your dish that's what you do but under that umbrella as they call it there's so much to talk about four one K. plans of obviously taxes are rollovers we talk about Social Security in your retirement\nHow much social service is Social Security enough to get people by no way we'll never was intended that we either no nope somewhere along the line Jeff the debt or people thinking that that's going to be enough for them I mean do you run into clients that say well I got Social Security\nI think they don't think about it they ... and it goes both sides won some will say oh some will say that\nYou make your foot is attacking you it is [laughter] a some will say there are\nSocial Security is going to be there are so you know they're not planning for it but it will be there uh with ... ... coming up next week and she's got to talk more about that she'll talk more about Social Security next week\nBecause as you mentioned that um when she's on and we were inundated with ... of the big question usually as you know what age is best for me to retire\nAnd I've got a couple of things on that today too but the other side is that you know they don't pay attention to their own retirement planning and pick the Social Security and their pensions are going to take care of them and some of them don't even have pensions so those are a little bit frustrating but you have to start planning early start to take responsibility for your own retirement planning\nOn the show we take phone calls we want to open up lines right now and get some questions on board got wide open phones\nOr you can join us at seven nine nine eleven thirty Abby windows in serious toll free number eight hundred eight three eight W I said a three eight nine four seven six or I get seven nine eleven thirty any question\nAnd on retirement your plan do you have enough are you on the right track the stats show Jeff I mentioned this often about half of America has some sort of plan in the other half as zero to little saving right\nA lot of statistics show that they've left it's ... it's up on our website they have less than twenty five thousand dollars saved by the time they reach age fifty that's not a good thing you can aggressively save after eight fifty but you want to\nMake sure that you plan before then and it's not a panic situation there are a lot of things again you're way between now and then um babies as we were just talking about mortgages ... education funding all those types of things getting medical bill medical bills yeah and those are the types of things also that could derail a successful plan medical bills and\nA kids and grandkids education so you have to be careful with that they have to take control of your own retirement planning\nAll right well uh the plan for the rest of the show besides phone calls we have a few segments that we get to every week\nThe boss minute a I Believe ... ... with us today for the boss a minute that's business owners savings and security the acronym so that's for business owners later in the show the sexy segment about wealth management\nAnd preservation and in throughout the show Jeff\nYou mix in some stories from the week that pertain to retirement let's start out with your first\nYeah I think it's a good one I thought I'm especially a timely it's just a USA Today article Dolan money worries triumph\nAre stressed about find that Robert Powell writes a column for USA Today and I really liked the way he writes and a lot of his emphasis is on retirement planning this one happens to be about money worries he says stressed about finances you're not alone workers of all ages\nAre concerned about money according to a pi Wu see us a employ financial wellness survey\nThey read about the lack of emergency savings not being able to retire when they want to how to cover health care costs retirement and how the financial support parents adult children and more\nAnd the steps that you can take in and Robert Powell goes into this I thought it was pretty good so I Want to highlight a couple of 'em once the first one says uh build an emergency fund not surprising\nNot having emergency savings is most frequently cited financial concern for millennia on genetics employees one proven way to build up that ... that fund\nAnd by the way it is true for those close to retirement as well a lot of our clients will see them that they'll have seven hundred and fifty thousand a million million and a half in savings and ... and a retirement plan and their retirement plans and have less than twenty thousand dollars in savings\nSo if they want to go on vacation or something else they may have to take a distribution from their retirement plan so it's not just for millennials and Gen x there's\nSo many things can happen in the first can you know fall apart\nYeah ... you're right not just a vacation but it could be ... or ... or something else [noise] why is that on your mind\n[laughter] you know as a matter of fact yes I think we're going through the crowd hard [laughter]\n... [laughter] they're not giving away free last time I checked the rest of your dad would say that given it away for free [noise]\nNow that I'm going to favor I write wanting it in a growing [laughter] is pretty transparent ball [laughter] as I just wanted to add that\nLie furnace okay it wasn't proven way to build that up as a make automatic savings and I think that's perfect ... just like you do with your four one K. plans have set among could take him directly out of your paycheck or I don't know if you're saving out of your check it out\nThey have a direct deposit into an investment accounts I think that's the best way to do it because it's like kind of gets automatic you don't think about it what kind of account what I put my emergency the individual or joined account with your wife focus I mean the interest bearing we're not going to not necessarily see you have savings for that\nFor ... for emergency fund for a larger thing it for for travel ... 'cause a lot of times the stuff that you put into an irregular savings account doesn't stick that's why people have\nNo less than twenty thousand dollars in savings so if you put into an investment accounts um that will be invested in the balance funds or or even stock funds\nIt all depends on your risk tolerance um then you're able to let that accumulates you don't watch it as as often so you're not as tempting and once you have several thousand dollars built up in there\nYou are less tempted to tap into it as well right so that's the type of thing that that you want to keep separate from your regular savings\nAnd we certainly don't want to tap into our four one K. for something like a furnace that's\nNumber two you read my notes Paul [laughter] the second thing is\nDon't raise your four one K. yeah you're ... it's a piggy bank it's designed for a long term retirement savings I you yet many plant participants borrowers drawn money from their four one K. for emergencies and that can be costly according to hypothetical scenario from J. P. Morgan uh four one K. plant participant\nWho contributed regular to regularly to four one K.\nWould have a balance a one point seven million they don't give any of the specifics in the article [noise]\nWhile a participant was four one K. loans had just one point one million so it's the difference is six hundred thousand dollars because one taps into it\nI'm new to the pursuit takes one four one K. loan officer takes multiple loans out because they say it's an easy way to access capital the difference in this one poll was\nA one four one K. putting putting them on and ends up with one point seven million the other one ends up with one point one nine 'cause he regularly borrowed from itself so don't do that stop it\nStop that that that's a good can we take our first call before we were just going to get a lot more coming up in the retirement clinic including your questions welcome all the wait till the end of the hour so you've got till eleven o'clock written W. I. B. Madison W. I. S. and Milwaukee Oak Creek and Dave good morning sir Hi Dave\nHey got a question about Social Security and Medicare so we can apply for Medicare when we're sixty five\nAnd Medicare covers hospital Medicare hard covers\nRight ... yeah ... care Medicare part D covers dental\nAnd well prescription prescription I Know the truth I'm Glad to see I think part of the is this prescription drugs I think you're right not not that simple\nAnd a medic gap for 'em out of pocket expenses\n... question is how much does all this or is it affordable this was stuff that people should know\nWell it's it it varies it also varies gets a actually a pretty good question what can we bring that up to\nUm next week I'm there early uncovered since here uh she's a a a expert from Social Security retired from Social Security but you still keeps in touch with them keeps up to date with that a Medicare premiums go up based on your income\nSo it can be relatively low a or can be up to five hundred dollars a month um let me just see if I can pop them up but it's based on your income\nUh I think it starts around well let's see\nLet me look at the chef is furiously typing I can I can get it or if you make any five thousand dollars or less I Can't tell if this is the joint uh the payments a hundred and thirty four dollars if it's among one thirty ... thirty four dollars a month eighty five a hundred and seven thousand here you go junk return\nAfter a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars or less you pay a hundred and thirty one hundred thirty four dollars a month for a premium for your Medicare\nFrom the fraudsters are in freezing your credit or if we all remember about I think it was about a year ago or so we had the big ah credit breach at Equifax and a lot of hackers had access to I think I mean I forgot what the numbers were here but it's something like a um\nA more than a hundred and forty five million people were affected by the hack\nI'm you know things like that come and go to publicize a lot you know you see a lot of it in the news but then we tend to forget about things pretty quickly\nI'm so there is a ride home of forgot about that and in ... and then you know something will pop up again as some you know major department store their credit cards will get hacked and all the information will get leak then\nAnd then I'll hit the headlines again so I figured I'd be a good time to talk about it hasn't happened in a while and there's also a new law that passed 'em and went into effect here on the twenty first of September that allows you to now freeze your credit report at no cost\nA prior to this it would cost probably about ten to Fifteen bucks\nA to freeze your credit report or and then if your credit report or your credit ... yeah so what the three different agencies yeah you'd have to call each one and freeze your information so what that does that sense it is to ah\nIt really locks up that information so nobody can take out a loan or credit card and your name\nI'm so again prior to this going into effect you'd have to call each one you'd have to freeze your information it'd be ten to Fifteen bucks\nA PR agency and then if you want to go buy a car you'd have to call them all again it'd be another ten to Fifteen dollars to ... to ... you know whatever word you want to use their um so President Trump or if they pass this legislation and I as or the twenty first now it's free for everybody I'm so it's\nMore dig deregulation from Trump he likes getting ready to get rid of the regulations and I like this yeah isn't that great hassle free\nYeah and well it is hassle free I mean there's a lot of people but when I got kind of\nUpset about the process you know some people think it should be frozen automatically um and then you would have to lift it in order to you know if you knew you were going to buy a car or take out a credit card or something like that are right by home\nBut unfortunately it's it's always available I until you actually freeze it if the goal here to eliminate as much hacking as possible yeah and in that that's the other thing is you see the commercials for things like life lock\nA you hear about credit freezes and and people ask which is the best to do uh I think it's good you know if you want to\nUse both a what a credit freeze will do is if somebody has your information\nIt either unable to take a loan out you know fraudulently a light what life lock would do would be um make you aware that your information is being used or somebody has attempted to open up a credit card or something in your name sure um so it one way of\nLife lock will kind of actively monitor it and and actively monitoring information on what they call it the dark Web uh whereas the credit freeze will actually prevent anything from happening so\nI'm most fascinated by the dark Web how do you get there [laughter] you they have a bar there [laughter]\nIt's very good I get to the ... the dark Web as a but that's that's ... I mean there's people out there and programs used to do just that hack into our accounts\n[noise] yeah and and unfortunately uh\nYou know nobody really freezes their credit uh I think the numbers are let's see here the an A. R.
