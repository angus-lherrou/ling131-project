{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "You know it's probably mind boggling to think if if you go like downtown Madison just a you know every few people you could probably point out and get them for possession\nOf a big question yeah I mean it was interesting in Washington DC you just walk down the street in parts of DC is legal there um nation's capital and you can smell it [laughter] you're supposed to smoke and I believe in your house but still I think you some\nTime yeah that's that's another whole aspect of these laws authentic sided can't imagine that\nWe don't allow you know LA just wildly consuming alcohol in the middle destroy Sienna Madison that you can be out in fact ... you can't hardly even smoke a smoke a cigarette\nOr ... you know in a in a lot of places you have to be so many feet from businesses so I imagine there are those sorts of restrictions that every state has different\nYeah I think that's the thing is every state is there\nWere not are not going to turn into Amsterdam you don't think\nNo no I think I think that's really important is that the uh Wisconsin statute you know should meet Wisconsin needs and I think that there's a lot of experience where they've been able to like really ensure that it doesn't impact and other people so\nYeah I'm ... now so in Wisconsin or the Wisconsin justice initiative is working to repeal I guess I didn't realize um [noise] we have a state law makes it a second offense of personal possession is a felony\nI Believe so yeah wow that's pretty significant yeah\nThat would be like a a second offense of the youth underage drinking or open and toxic hands you know if you look at it like that becoming a felony what what at one time was a very minor either a tick tick it offensive or a misdemeanor yeah and you jump to a felony\nYeah I mean it's and again like you could choose to prosecute somebody for that felony or not\nAnd so when you say in Milwaukee County this was quite a problem\nI'm just saying that this this report that was down by the ACLU and twenty Thirteen looking nationally they found that African Americans were prosecute almost four times more frequently for possession than whites in ... Manhattan New York city or the New York times did a\nStudy a police reports and found it after Americans were Fifteen times more likely to be arrested for possession so\nIs that they they find it in conjunction with another crime or is that their primary enforcement I guess I'm Wondering I'm not I'm not sure about that\nBut I it just it just really is speaks to the fact that this disproportionately affects people of color in terms of how people arrested in and they're treated\nAnd well and then that goes for for the people that are arrested and charged with these uh offenses um a lot of them don't have money to pay legal fees and so I see a initiative here is looking a working on um\nPublic defender yeah yeah so that's very important I Can't really speak to that because I I'm not working with him on that issue but that is something that I Do know they're very active on\nYeah fix the forty so they're trying to I guess I didn't realize that that Wisconsin has the lowest in the nation um hourly rate for public defenders forty dollars per hour which are for you or me or Joe blow sounds like a pretty good hourly rate I mean forty bucks an hour but I suppose in legal circles that peanuts\n[laughter] I actually went to law school I don't practice but yeah it's it's you should start practicing Andrew [laughter] I think there's money there been any that I mean I Do\nI Do think that that's a real issue is ensuring the public defenders are adequately resourced so they can provide adequate defense of um indigent um folks who've been charged with something so yeah I mean that's that's something I'm not directly working on that for them but it's definitely an important issue\n[noise] so um between now and the the times are coming up quickly here November sex ed Tuesday election day or what do you do from now until then is there any more you can do has had the successes in other states are kind of\nDone your job for you or are you still need convincing out there that are the should be approved\nI think the big thing is people should be aware it's on the ballot because I think because it's so strongly supported by the public across all age groups across all ethnicities men and women there's no gender gap it all on this issue\nThe key is that people know about it that that's why I'm actually talking to you today I'm Robin is just to get the word out because I think if people know about it there'll be sure to vote for it they'll be sure to show up and vote\n'em and there's a vote candidate is twenty eight seem dot com is a website we've created I'm just a chance you can go on there see some of the ... the studies or see some of the people Wisconsin ides who really benefited from it is how cannabis but yeah that's ... it's just really about raising awareness that's kind of what we're we're all about\nHave you heard some uh some of the allegations or a conspiracy theories from opponents claiming now that ... you're just using this issue not you personally [noise] but uh this issue is being put out there to dangle in front of young likely democratic voters to get them to the polls\nWhich is the even if that was the case has had a bad thing [laughter]\nI mean again like this issue is important for everyone um even people over sixty five according to this poll I cited earlier support\n... full campus legalization um so I think this is important for every single voter to hear about him for them all to come out and vote I think democracy works best when people vote\nAnd if and if it takes an issue to get someone to vote more power to them I mean again like I think it appeals to everyone so\nYeah and the ... so if this is the issue that motivates you to vote I guess so Soviet I don't I don't see what the harm is with that I I'm just playing devil's advocate with some of the stuff that you know you're a politics is a really silly business as you are well aware\nAnd get some of these ah these claims and yeah well yeah I'm sure you guys didn't just come up with is to coincide with a hotly contested gubernatorial race right\nExactly and considering that thirty one states already done it it's like this is some new ideas\nYeah somebody came up with ... exactly yeah and what and what happens if you don't see the the support that you thought you would you know voters always surprised though yeah I just never say never you get back at it again or what happens\nI mean that's the thing is I'm an attorney optimist I Believe that people I mean based on what I saw at the county level meetings people really want this\nThere's a desire that their legislate their legislative leaders listen to them and provide this legislation so I firmly believe that we're going to see good results from these referendum I mean the reason they're on the ballot is this was like a grassroots movement I mean literally\nThe word got out about Milwaukee we provided some educational information but like these county supervisors were highly motivated and you've got when he got places like um\nBecause we all need to wear cameras on our faces right will get this a new line of high tech eye glasses something called ...\nIt's actually hoping to be the glasses that you'll light to where first they actually look\nNot too bad I mean they don't look like nerdy glasses like Google Glass did\nAh there's you can have a classic

they're paid users will be eligible for twenty five percent refund for any fees paid during that time\nSo here's the deal I was going to pay up to eighty five million dollars to settle this class action lawsuit that includes fifty million for compensation for up to two hundred million affected folks plus another thirty five million for the lawyers are so the lawyers are getting thirty five million\nOr the two hundred million effective users are getting five hundred million so uh to the lawyers that means millions to you is probably worth about a hundred bucks and we have the link over a

funny and I'll send you something funny and I said\nYou know what do you think about that this was a tweet that kind of search the Internet on fire [laughter] as her name was Alyssa Alyssa and I I

you get a blank feeding and just put songs on it and the Internet went crazy like how did that ever where did the blank CDs come from first of all I'm very impressed that she tweeted the like she

for crow is it what is it is a two thousand five two thousand seven then or an ... where it ends as to thousands OK arrive\nSo generate millennials or anyone to Ninety six K.\nAnd the millennials were the ones that were responding to this thing in mind that old generation already has moved past all of my technology when one person responded with a tree just saying I'm a billion years old and they

thinking about other things that millennials and\nGenerations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct\nAnd the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now is television commercials my son watches everything on YouTube right he doesn't know what cable television is it's all you too but then we hook up the ... and we're gonna

absolutely right because in and you know where\nHe has never really had to be a commercial for if he does see a commercial and only Fifteen seconds yes it's more than ... and a half minute commercial there is a skip right once he watches five seconds of it\nRight I'm In fact when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going\nHow do you

about my son is she'll say I want to watch a movie and you know renting it is I bet we have a sixty five inch television in our living I'm not bragging it's huge he doesn't want to watch it he wants to end his lap and his hand on a small little eye pad\nIt's so interesting to me and you know what though\nThat it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it versus how you might use\nIt and I want bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five insurance but they have a friend is like trying from drew in over\nThe now in

[noise]\nUm I read some faraway case Sarah llamas similarities they both retirement plans they both can help you lower your tax bill today provide taxi for girls and help provide an income source retirement that said there are many differences and let's just take a look at some of that in mind oh explorer five things you can do with an irate that you\nWith a four one K. first may qualify charitable donations distributions qualified charitable distributions or two CDs for short allow IRA owners\nAnd Irene beneficiaries it's eight Seventy and a half or older to send up to a hundred thousand dollars from the IRA directly to a charity without including that amount of ... in your income so if you make that\nA qualified charitable distribution you won't get a charity deduction\nBut by never ending income tax return the first place not still results a lower tax bill if you took your normal irate distribution required minimum distribution at Seventy and a half so that's why I make a qualified charitable distribution to just take the town penalty free distribution for higher education in general\nDistribution ticket from retirement ... prior to eight fifty nine and a half our subject income tax an additional ten percent early penalty in this day in Wisconsin is a three point three three percent state penalty\nLaw does however for ... for a number of exceptions one such such exception is available if you use your IRA to pay for higher education expenses and again a lot of times you can't do it with your four one K. if you try to do the same thing with your four one K. you might end up with a bigger tax build a new plan to\nTake a distribution whenever you want to call the retirement account for reasons supposed to be for your retirement that sad life happens and sometimes people need to access\nTo fund sooner yeah still working for me four one K. you may not be able to do it different rules apply to for one can't taking money out there but access to your funds may be extremely limited especially if you're still under fifty nine and a half\nWe talked about this before just borrowing money or taken alone on of your own four one K. some people say but that's my money I I put that money in their ... year penalized for that you\nAre penalize for taking it out early in many cases sometimes you have to pay the taxes and the penalties do you have a double whammy there um if you need to it may make sense it may be easier and may make sense to take it out of Iran set of your four one K.\nAnd otherwise aggregate are MDs once you hit Seventy and a half you have to take a record minimum distributions ah you have to aggregate among all a IRAs but you can take the distribution of one\nAnd the last one is avoid withholding if you take money out of four one K. most plans was happy with a a twenty percent federal withholding right away it was an IRA that's not the case if you've already had distribution or taxes paid from Social Security or from a pension that you get\nAnd you're taking the IRA required meant distribution you they will withhold twenty percent automatically you know that said you have to watch out for Texas anyway\nTo me a couple of points sure sure well a couple of things in a emphasize too in that with the you talked about the art making terrible arm de contributions and that's one of the things that we always had to wait on for years and years that the Congress would pass it because one of those things every year thing when they there's no money to to allow\nA tax return will contributions from unarmed de normally pass you know a week before the end of the year or sometimes the following year after that they are yeah\nAny done last year those count to which people aren't you know moral kind of do it but one thing when the person my personal opinion of the few things they got rid of this budget deal the less while they made that permanent yep I'm also you mentioned ... the last ones you mentioned was you aggregate that are the\nUm the arm did you take from all the ... I raise that you have if you have a new ... is also helpful\nI I Want to make sure I get the details writes a seal you started life on the writer along with being a turn of the financial consultant an ear nose all stuffed wildlife insurance to a but at any rate a hundred thousand dollar policy you're paying a hundred and twenty five dollars a month and they told you was paid up if it's paid up why would you still be paying premiums into a\nWell I I guess what I'm a firm critical the Lakers are covered employees ... sixty thousand\nYeah that's well that's kind of confusing to me because they say you reduce the coverage is sixty thousand but then you pay a hundred and ten dollars a month and then how long have you been something's not paid up because you're still paying into it so maybe the terminologies off a little bit\nIt sounds like it's it's a policy that's probably worth keeping if you've had it for a long time you paid a hundred twenty five dollars a month into it depends what companies with two if it was a good company has a great ratings you know you want to\nMake sure that your insurance company is going to be around\nUm I Would I Would have to get a better I'm an explanation as to what's going on with that because the pay the policy means you don't pay more into it and\nYou keep a death benefit to\nKeep the desk at that level or or or less they reduce the debt spends about sixty thousand and your options to have a paid up at sixty thousand then not pay any more premiums but to pay sixty to the lower to sixty thousand dollars\nAnd pay a hundred and ten dollars leads me to believe that probably it's a universal life type of policy where the interest rate on the policy drop so now you have to either reduced the amount of death benefit or put more money into it and so what they said is that if you reduce the amount of insurance to sixty thousand a hundred and ten dollars a month carried a policy for a little bit longer\nThat's what I'm thinking probably is happening that the interest rate probably went down the policies unraveling a little bit not paid up probably just the opposite\nAnd so that you know the twenty thousand dollars cash value won't be enough to support the policy forever I take a look and maybe get a more detailed\nReview on that I'm I'm nearly sure that it's not pay up and I'd be a little bit more careful with that\nBy having said that you've already paid the acquisition costs you paid to agents commission on it so you if you can modify that policy problem would be better off doing that but there are some new policies out that may be able to to guarantee the coverage to a hundred and five as an example of that may be a good option for you as well\nJohn if you've got more quite go ahead you\nKnow what the but the problem is you know with with your age or older it's harder to get like a\nLot to a good point especially if you have a health issue that there might be a trouble getting but I think it's at least worth looking at because some of those policies will take the twenty ... twenty thousand dollars that you have\nAnd you may end up with the being able to stretch a death benefit out a lot longer I Would take a look at that ... thing John thanks for the call Joe yeah we can help give me give me a call if we can help\nSway he did he made a point at the end that then I never really thought of I have had life insurance forever but as you age if you're looking for a new policy or when range it your your health certainly plays into that\nOr else as an issue but also the mortality tables people are living longer and also some of the fees are lower even if you do have a health issue\nJohn thank you so much for the question we go next to pee walking Mike you're on the retirement clinic which Justin Aaron call my good morning my morning\nOr good might call a credit card to\nWatch that and in a way ... rock or my wife and I are both retired a year or two colleges all ... ... ... wrote that\nGreat we got about five hundred thousand Cold War in Iraq and Iran regular IRA money and our current through it\nYou're working on a grand a year my thought we were like oh my word I think\nWe're not rich with my wife never tell your life right you don't get\nYour requirement is what you're\nGetting your head we live on your show where I could go on for a period of ... of a draw for work or white or or one of them are with your primary care\nAre cool or will come around grand on her and my group\nI think you're thinking right about that I Would put a pencil to it I wouldn't just wing it her eyeballs that would make sure to put a pencil to it I'd also look at what the options might be now you're right if you take the money I teach sixty two most a lot of people will think\nThat that's better option a ticket sixty two because you'd have to be guaranteed that you're gonna live 'til about eight Seventy eight or eighty and that is to break period that's just to break even Iraq\nOr some some might make sense and you preserve the for the four one K. R. I. R. if you ultimately roll into an irate\nYou know another thing to consider too and I'm not sure if you did this when you when you plan to sell out you need to live off of fifty thousand a year\nIs that grocers that net taxes have to come out of the what you don't pull out of your IRA also and your pension hole yes all that's\nAll tax but again the tax rate is lower the obviously the lets you can't live ... ... ... ... what about thirty thirty three thousand a year that's why\nAfter taxes yeah it is lower your also alone you have less deductions and stuff too in retirement\nTo make sure that you are a and inflation and that question too and that was something if you screw up and live a long time then inflation could really up until ... it into your\nRetirement and if you have a fixed pension it isn't linked to an index Social Security will be but the pension will not be you want to make sure that you have an inflation factor in there as well they might get the beginning of the call you said no debt so he said everything's all good yeah that's outstanding yeah yeah that's a big loss\nGot Seventy thousand just what would know that I Know no more no more no car payments or college\nAt ... I Want to be like Mike\nWhat are your age your order one years but I don't know what I'm going to do something that just you know I just really not much I just enjoy\nEnjoy retirement yeah yeah but I Would be for a boy and I\nI Would just say before you pull dependent and makes you make sure you put a pencil to adapt to not just eyeball it\nSo do the math they might get good quite understood at home a lot of good calls today we thank you for the question is what we do have plenty of time twenty minutes left in the program for you to call into the retirement clinic at seven nine nine eleven thirty some lines are open still in eight hundred three eight nine four seven six point no debt at all how often do you guys\nYeah and that's exactly the type of person we talked to a lot you know people like Mike is you know who well okay I Want a workout should for pencil and paper you know that's why people talk to us that you know hopefully retirements only something that they do once and you know it's always something to do once and I had to go back to something\nThat we help people with every day and so it can help to get the un experts opinion on that too you're not going to do your own heart surgery a few [laughter] years anyway I learned about it and I can probably figure out how to do the doctor doesn't perform hearts right and that's why people come to us to a specialist you'll go to your family doctor if you have heart issues you come you go to a cardiologist myth us\nUh also knowing what you need dollar wise to live on annually what's your comfort level she had a number in mind for everybody it's different most people I Would think air and would want to maintain their quality of life that standard of living that they're cussing too and keep that going into retirement right", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "28"}
