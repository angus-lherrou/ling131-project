{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WIBA", "content": "And um and and so he was out of the building um and and had been dragged towards um the residents and hotel where people most people seem to um to go towards a before our first officer got there and in our first officer was there and three minutes and Seventeen Seconds so\nUm and that's the first thing he saw was that\nNaturally [noise] what do you think that he share with you what his thoughts do you know see somebody you know the um\nOne of the things I'm hearing from our folks is um there were like what are we don't want to drill for today and that's not that doesn't seem that way you would do a drill is to have the dispatcher hit the alert on and say we've got an active shooter so a little bit of disbelief on their part to\nI can tell ya and media park too because he came over the scanner um when the first calls and and I looked at a co worker and said oh no it's strange yeah\nAnd um but um they knew pretty quickly that wasn't a drill or or or somebody exaggerating for instance because of the multiple calls that were coming in but again that first officer who saw several people down\nI'm a you know officers that arrived there about the same time could see that the uh door was shot out the glass door I'm and I'm and again people streaming out and um they talked it was almost eerie that people were standing along the sidewalk in the street you know as they were\nScreaming out as they are going in\nSo they know pretty quickly that this was no drill and this was no exaggeration um you know obviously we knew it wasn't a drill um but\nYou know some people can make mistakes say oh I think there's an active shooter and you know exactly yeah you know but no they knew pretty quickly this was the real deal\nWith or the government wearing any protective body armor yeah those are details that I Can't get an idea right now but it happened um yeah it happened or just just before ten thirty is and he had he had been at work for a little bit yes yeah and then just um hey can you share what did he just stand up and that's\nThat's my understanding there was no confrontation with anybody there is no yelling everybody there is no pre warning um that is my understanding is that and just started shooting and people you know just had no clue what was going on but\nYou know I mean at any one in particular in such a staff and again I don't\nKnow that I think the mass of people there are a hundred and five people in that office yeah about five hundred in the total building complex or so if he was specifically aiming at somebody or was he you know just shooting at a mass of people I can tell you the you know\nEspecially you know you you just look at all I got shot ten times I must have been directed towards him they had no relationship they didn't work in the same team so you know I don't think he was targeted and and I think it was just general shooting as opposed to I'm picking out specific people\n... as as as you mentioned in a you know just trying to visualize or emphasize these people at work hearing this gunfire going under their dad did he go up under desks\nNot aware of that now um I I Know you know the the reaction that people had was some fled\nSome did get up under their desks some were able to get into rooms and you know kind of a barricade themselves in the rooms I think the majority probably ran out um but you know that was their their reactions of what they could do to keep themselves safe and they did a great job they all survived\nYeah yeah and uh\nYou know because the day after there was the one out east for three of them die exactly yep and sell how this how fortunate I guess I don't have to tell you you know that and that and that the officers were unharmed as well\nAnd he did show that the officers he'd get the ... and um and they\nTraded if he was he just a bad\nLast a touch [laughter] [noise] um but so they tried to maybe even for a minute they tried that they had him um cornered they had a rifles and and they tried to negotiate his surrender at at heat 'em dropped his weapon they would have taken him into custody but when he shot at them then they had to use deadly force\nYou think at that point it was probably a kiss I top situation that\nUh that yeah I Do yes\nYeah\nI'm a yeah I had a hundred and five people in this office setting these eat like your typical office with partitions ingest state we're not talking now it's big open room right well\nIt's kinda both and this is one of those um hip a work places\nThat you and I probably not very good looking around and that's not hip here so they did have\nThe the uh classic um to farms if you will hear from yeah I think they also had a wide open area you know\nLike a big say cafeteria and you know coffee shop and things like that I'm so he was in both those areas both in the cube farm\nAnd like any open area he didn't just stay put he actually walked around yes and and get some of\nThat yeah wow [noise] and um I I\nDon't they are offering counseling ... some of them are back at work right at\nSo WTO paradigm and again I I cannot um commend them enough on early recognition on how this affected their employees and what to do with it do about it um I've met with um their\nUm workforce on two occasions as have I'm a chef Mahoney and myself and the second time they they rented space downtown at the overture center and bread and both of not only their employees but there are significant others they brought in trauma psychologist\nOr from the area or they had a breakfast we brought in our first responders they were able to meet them\nAnd then um the continued on for the rest of the day they have sense rented a office space and the west side of Madison um to temporarily go into and they're in the process of remodeling um their current facility Middleton\nUm because they didn't want it to look exactly the same as it looked on that Wednesday so again they're um they're really looking at all the different angles and trying to take care of their their people but it sounds like they're coming back to meddle in and we want him back\nYeah but I yeah obviously you'd want to get that ... is always the first stepping back me and that it that it's an man\nWell there's gonna be a lot of different things that trigger the trauma so one of the things was when we knew we didn't know any other way to do it in a situation like that people just run\nRight so they leave their purses they leave their cell phones you know imagine getting along without your cell phone I mean I heard the stories of a guy didn't know how to call his wife because he didn't remember telephone [laughter] uh yeah I Know um people were running on issues um\nTheir car keys were left at their desk you know all their cars were in the parking lot for the next day we tried to reunify them with their property\nAnd them coming back that quickly was a ... a a traumatic experience for many of them some of them couldn't do it had to send other folks to do that or certainly um when they went back to work even though it wasn't a different location or last week traumatic when the um [noise]\nThe report is released you know there's going to be some dramatic video dramatic audio um that they're going to see and that's gonna traumatize I'm also so there's going to be different steps\nAre that are going to a traumatized them in different ways and again I Know the uh the CIA has access to both Dane County victim witness people in the state has their own people and they're going to meet with them beforehand and meet with our police officers beforehand let them know exactly what information will be released let them look at\nAll right I just love technology when he can have a positive effect on our lives and heart disease and stroke a church two of the biggest causes of death worldwide now imagine for a moment\nThat you can get a warning that you are going to have a heart attack years before the event\nEver occurred that's right well thanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hard scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently these T. T. scans tell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed\nBy plaque well that's the problem they say now that they can figure this out even before develop they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's going to be going on five years down the line that you should start preventive measures right now to avoid the platform for me so you can start singing are you ready don't go bake\nIn my heart [laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the came commando show time for them to cover their ears or you wanna mute the television if you're watching the game commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room\nAs long as they're clear we're good to go All right you're ready good there's a dark side of technology that a lot of folks are brushing off it's the use of robots for use in how do you say intimate situation [noise] things that happened\nBetween two people just like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a pole dance and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal\nThe city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with a company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a love dollars brothel in his shoe soon so that people would be able to use its human like dolls\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie Westworld Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visiting location then they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits [noise]\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device that resembles a human being\n[noise] okay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the ... commando show a we have come up with the perfect name for that how about a Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck [noise] yes [noise] okay [noise]\nOkay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise an average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies since the year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe study shows that men account for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the death so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so it's right ...\nYou're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall buildings are us woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nOr a tie woman was hit and killed by a trained this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the real tracks\nBritish woman Luis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach wall so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we were speaking\nThat's it but if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a refund had shot for the funeral mhm and finally be careful what you search for online we were talking about this before the show\nBecause I read the headline and it said ruby rose is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online and I had to sit there and said you know what it might just out of it 'cause\nI don't know who ruby rose is okay and I even watch orange is the new black\nShe must have a great publicist because\nShe was only on aren't as new black just a few times but according to McAfee they measure how many search results featuring of celebrities name contains linked to militias website is when it happens a criminal they they say are a somebody's searching for her also on the list is are the original one or woman Linda Carter\nA Debra Messing Courtney Kurdish she in amber heard a Kelly rip a bread William hanky or they're also they're on the list of the most dangerous celebrities to look for on line here in the United states now meanwhile if you look at the list in the u._k. ... who do you think is number\nOne on the top of that list if you had to guess who do you think is number one on that list Andrew you've just put your head up and she liked to guess Megan Merkel\nKamkar dash here in the u._k. really AS number one the u._k.

from Google this past week that you need to know about it if you haven't used Google Translate it's really slick or use a lot when I was in Europe over the summer I Love it especially when\nI was in a restaurant and I look at the menu and I didn't know any French and I could say definitely don't want the snails until now Google Translate on your phone listening to the same pronunciation this is really amazing technology dumped brushes up\nGoogle Translate has added speech output local version English French Spanish been golly you can hear English results for example with a Spanish accent or with a French accent or an Indian accent or listen to French Canadian spent really something\nAnd this next Google update is one that you might want to pass along to your family members and friends who say they've been working on a brand new product at let's Android users control their device using only their voice\nIt's been in beta a really long time two years but this past week Google started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice oh so you can click buttons and other things just with your boys\nOne's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd say like click seven for example\nYou can go back home you can tell the device to turn on the wife fire Bluetooth adjust to a ball you open the app basically what ever you would want to do on your Android device you can now do with only your voice you can download boys to access through Google Play [noise]\nEvan right up and just a few moments where it's five route or security settings to turn on before it's too late and then later on\nThis hour the things that you should not be even thinking about buying as far as technology goes in the month of October but back to the phones me go with Nick and Oakville, Washington\nEditor Nick how are you I'm good what's going on [noise] um\nI've been looking into some a money making it up um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate apps or if they are are you a maybe inviting trouble phone New Delhi and possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good questions um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA\nLiving you know on a bus extra months\nHere it's it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars for two thousand dollars for anything that you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks who's the one that led to watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I pull this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion ab that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to Costco came up and says hey you know we have a task Korea and so I figured you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right and so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Cosco\nSo I took a picture and sent it off through the ... and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like once called folk ... pie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various\nUm agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way there's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise]\nUh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right or you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff\nAnd but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat calling for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coin that will be translated into like an apple gift card their surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my website does that help you out\nAnd cook something a little confused that's\nOh it does and then when you and like most people nobody reads the terms and conditions on any of this stuff so opposed to link to it over a commando dot com and speaking about making money coming up in the third our of this week show you don't want to miss it because I have even more ways that I didn't mention here\nAnd that's like one of the actually lower points but then you build up

phone\nRang and it was available to first class passengers\nAnd German train route now Twenty years later Nineteen forty six in America\nWe had the first car phones that were available publicly oh I remember having a car fine so for cool that was like there was like the nineties yeah in the forties thinking pretty sick they were using radio waves but since the ban with was so limited\nThey had got their first couple of customers and everything was filled up there was no more room for anyone to make phone that many customers and they have under a hundred I Know in Sweden at the same time their car foreign service was available and they have maxed out at a hundred and twenty five customers\nSee I yeah that that's crazy I didn't ...\nIs that it went that far back I had no idea I would've guessed the late seventies most yeah I would've said the seventies in the seventies Motorola they came out\nWith their first ever put public cell phone that was available and they made their first ever public cell phone call on a device that weighed two and a half pounds that's a big phone\nThat's a heavy phone imagine a cell phone if the technology did not advance and we were still
