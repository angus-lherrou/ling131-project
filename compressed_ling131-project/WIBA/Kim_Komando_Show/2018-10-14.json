four hours later she was back and she was a holy terror\nShe threatened a roommate she threaten the cops um this is the problem with addiction and mental health she wanted to die that day so we at that point emptied her apartment 'cause we had arranged for although she was supposed to pay for and we actually cut her out of her life and we told her if you come to the house will call the police and we did\nWe said you need to find your own what you need to figure out what are you gonna live she was she was arrested at my request for the heroin that I found that our apartment and into the cops that some people ... my name over that\nBut I knew that she we were trying to force when we were out of options Robin we tried every treatment option under the sun ones where she would go ones where we would take her ones were and we ended up I mean she'd been through Roger she'd been through hazel then she'd been through a new start a locally\nWe ended up saying you're on your own don't come near us until you're sober\nAnd we wouldn't know where she was for days or weeks at a time but she continue to survive\nHow well it doesn't take much imagination to figure out how a person gets by she couldn't hold a job she was still using for the next six months she used whenever she could and she flopped here and flop there and we'd occasionally seer would occasionally bring her some uh some food and coffee\nWouldn't give her cash anybody who gives their kid money or doesn't watch their possessions if they're an addict is probably full\nBut eventually we had to throw out of her life and that was when the financial support came to near end now ... you know we we do we're OK terms of our own financial situation and so there were times we gave her gifts we tried to treat her just like the other children if somebody got a hundred dollars for the birthday she got a hundred hours we made we reached the point where we actually said we can't control what she does\nAnd she has to control it\nIt's been hard she was a lovely girl and she made so many friends when she moved to Maine she fled to Maine by the way because she had an aunt there\nAnd she fled there because she had nothing left here and she manipulated somebody into buying or one way plane tickets she manipulator and into taking her and that didn't last long because after two months of sobriety in work and so far she started drinking again I don't know how often use heroin in Maine it's there but not as prevalent this year\nThey might have thirty seven overdose saves in a year we have a minute we care\nSo so Maine was a place where she seemed to have some ability to make friends get a job but the cycle returned\nAnd ... when when you got that call ... how did that call though\nWhich call you referring to go back in November of twenty fourteen or this year\nThis year if you're the final call\nWell this is where it gets a little tough to talk about [noise] um\nWe visited Mali for five days at the end of August and she wasn't using then you can tell when somebody's using their behaviors revert to manipulative and emotional and her behavior as were\nWere were positive although she was four Lawrence she has she had a profound sadness about her and she said she was very lonely\nBut our message to her was clear your twenty nine and you're only because she pushed everybody away through your addictions you we got to health insurance we did a were grateful for the Affordable CARE Act we got her on it\nShe did get some medical care and we encouraged her to get back in and see a therapist and see a doctor get back on some anti depressants\nGet into therapy and work on healthy eating healthy living gainful employment she lost her job in may\nApparently because she showed up high probably on heroin so she started using there but we had a great visit with her and we made plans for the future because when somebody's alone and lonely and depressed\nYou want to give them things to look forward to we want it around in those three things when we visit or in Maine and we left we love you dearly we will always be your parents and always be in your corner [noise]\nUm you can't come live with us because you almost died a year ago when you came back here at our request because you weren't making it there and there's too much heroin here she seemed to be able to survive better there there's heroin everywhere but it's greater here than it is so\nMuch you know and and uh if I can just take them all here Chris I'm not to let our listeners now is this is such an important topic that it's a two part and a a another program airs a week from this Sunday or Chris will join us once again and Madison police chief\nUh Mike ... who has a than with you through this chief global and I have become friends the odd couple well party and the police chief you guys could be a your OWN TV show you\nYou know we'll talk about that what you call but let's just say that my wife and I were immensely\nGrateful immediately for the fact that they saved her life and twenty fourteen for the next three years we had a daughter\nThat would've been dead um\nThey saved her again when she moved back home last fall I learned about that after the fact to a friend let me know that that had happened and we knew she was struggling and then she detox and moved back to Maine so so you asked about the call well it's funny I was in Grand county I was just starting a jury trial for a client\nAnd the district attorney was in the first five minutes of his opening statement in a in a trial and I never look at my phone and I happen to pull it out and look at and I have a text from her roommate in Maine who I knew was in Italy\nAnd he texted me and he told me I just got a test from other roommate she came home for the weekend I found Molly dead of an overdose all my God [noise] um I I I'm ... now but I wasn't composed then I walked up\nI didn't say a word nobody who was going on and juries looking at me as a judge on his hand on my phone to the judge and India and I said please just look at this and I asked if we could miss try the case recession and they were very they were wonderful to me the judge in a da ... new wives going and I immediately called my wife\nAfter getting a friend there and and ... it was very hard and I said then I spent since she was Fifteen\nTelling myself diluting myself Robbins that I was ready for the call because Mali never followed through and most addicts don't follow through\nMadison and the county have phenomenal resources right now from Mary the Madison area recovery and ... recovery initiative which which do cheap all talk about and I'll talk about uh next week but\nAnd he uses a whole body legs arms torso steps are about one put four inches\nAs computer vision on the approach they said to hit terrain accurately they call this robot the world's most dynamic humanoid weighs about Seventy five kilos which is about a hundred and

cheaper than keeping my wife\nAnd then other robot taking over the world news here's something that you may be never thought of would it be possible for a self driving car\nHad not just be a self driving car but they use all of this technology be so advanced that it can be a WMD a weapon of mass destruction\nWell research out this past week that autonomous vehicles are a giant security risk and white hats need to get there before the black have to do\nIn a closed door a Q A session Ilan most said that fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario and announce it they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source of all they do a better job of bad than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\n[noise] boy I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of wave that is Google self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about ... because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you in the Ford truck they make a huge chunk of change off of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with the self driving taxi\nThe see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a place five miles away too far to walk too far to carry a tree or in your back but\nWait what do you see at that Google Search you see an ad click here to have ... give you a free ride to get your Christmas tree\nSo hypothetically we could start seeing promoted rides for free in place so different searches on Google\nNow we must have this past week it's self driving cars had ten million miles of experience on public roads I just glad there isn't a self driving car run by Microsoft because every day we hear about some crash crazy stuff\n[noise] and finally as of July twenty ninth team in certain parts of the world\nAll electric cars will need to make a low speed noise by law\nYou see these electric cars are just too quiet right now people can't hear the cars and they're just too many accidents\nAnd for um twenty twenty on they have to be retrofitted with sound generators if there was no engine sounded all road safety

brand new sound was going to be heard when an electric car goes by now I Want you to hear it it's going to be the sound and other particularly car it has a fancy name\nIt's called the audible vehicle alert system now the sound can be heard and speed up to twelve miles per hour\nThis before I play the north and tell you a little bit more about\nThe noise is four years in the making\nAnd it was designed specifically to be audible by ... organs but not heard by anybody inside the car\nAnd this is funny that first of the technicians developed as down that was like they say a size five space craft but they had to shelve it because people when the car was driving by they would look up in the sky rather than at the road so back to the labs they when they came up with a brand new sound\nAnd at the MIT it from a speaker located behind the front grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the sound that the brand new electric jaguars going to make in your neighborhood\nOh that's awesome\nSo as the electric cars going by that's the sound that that the that the researchers say that doesn't sound like a size five space craft or what do you think Andrea I'm ready for that\nWhy don't they just make it sound like a car like a V. eight [laughter] [laughter] they're gonna use that one\nYeah yeah you know what you just can't beat the sound of a V. eight or bigger right I mean here we are we still sounds like the space craft to me well look enough where's where's each T. sounds like a shaver [laughter] I'm not sure that that's the sound that the jaguar was really going forward that particular point\nHey listen let's talk about one of our grade sponsors here at the came commandos show bowling branch ... mattresses you know the backbone of a

we're\nTraveling to Europe next month okay um my husband and I both have gone to identity tap so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a ... an app for when I'm using public why and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry I thought\nIt was good his fat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on the public why buy everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay so if you are tied began your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever it may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that out of the year so ... and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that is going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to I just traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out OK okay and so the\nWhole idea behind using the VP an app\nIs that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where are you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam\nAnd Germany oh how fun Oh yes I Can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick who daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality so you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is okay\nThere's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to me the ... most\nThey don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right quick song and you know if you can do a food toward any of the city has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your whatever\nUh then there's nowhere to BP and then there's also freedom VPN which\nThey were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free of like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it is that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go to your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another\nApp that you need to get its called mobile passport beard we talk about that\nI'm no okay you need this app okay just if

Laurie\nHi Ken welcome to say it this week I learned that Google Plus ... that's just on the Nineteen ... what is that all of that little boy in search of an online class\nI heard options including gets hard line dot neat\nPlus or a dot com coastline dot com and need we um are any of the it's clear winner warning and I'm not looking for Facebook or a hair and a one happy Google was used or find a new community by\nAuto [noise] so you first of all you're one of the to Google Plus users who were really upset but there's\nA single parent community ...\nDigit membership ... community good are over forty thousand\nWell the reason why I Know the reason why I say that as Google said that they shut it down not only because they had were going to talk about this and the next hour but they had it open for three years but basically the heads of goals that nobody is using it anyway so it was shut it down so you do have different options there's one side or that you didn't mention\nIs that it's called the ds for off and that's D. I. A. S. P. or a with India's for it looks and it works it acts a lot like Google Plus where a\nA little bit different meaning that you choose a pod as the kind of that's what they call their ... their groups pods so you can create a pod if that's what you what you sign up and then you join the conversation\nUh and then it also integrates into your other social media so if you did want it to everybody on Facebook or Twitter or ... what have you that you had this group going that would be one way there's also another site called steam it and that's S. T. E. M. I. T. and of course you know there's always read it if you wanted to get into more of a type of a message board feel\nBut all but some links free over at ... dot com and if you do to have a Google Plus again like I did and you forgot about it which I did a there are ways that you should shut it down and you can just Google that said delete Google Plus account you haven't done that already you might want to take some time and go ahead and do that within the next\nIf this guy by the name of Dr Freddie a new see there he's Facebook's official head of health research that's right a giant social media site has a head of health research\nHe wants to large scale access to more granular data he says on patients social and behavioral characteristics you might remember there was a proposal in place or Facebook wanted to match up user data and help hospitals figure out what patients might need special care or treatment\nWell Mark and Dr Freddie are gearing up again so I'd stop posting anything about what you eat what you do what you smoke up on Facebook\nUnless it's something like wow you know another great breakfast organic goats and flaxseed and fresh fruit along with a yummy carrots celery broccoli smoothly I just can't wait for dinner to a yummy tofu salad though in the way by the ... [noise] probably [noise]\n[noise] hey also this past week Google have their big product announcement here's what they want you to by surprise surprise to get a brand new set of pixels so try the ... three is one of their brand new phones a five point five minutes just split because it's such back eight hundred bucks\nThen there's the pixel three XL a six point three inch display starts at nine hundred bucks this is interesting and I got some camera upgrades of course they all do but they have a new color called not pink\n[laughter] what should we call this color let's call it not paying that work\nThere is also an official charging stand there is now the slate twelve point three inch tablets eight hundred bucks I mean like androids stuff at some to check out\nA there's also the home hub this they're smart speaker bolted down hundred and fifty bucks and it's going to ship on October twenty second comes in grain bank not paying a dark gray and white and also has built in you too isn't that fabulous maybe not\nBut this home hub is actually something that is really a fascinating\nIt's not as robust as Amazon's Alexa but it's a really strong competitor and the reason why I bring this up is that if somebody on your shopping list for Christmas and they like Android and Google or something you might wanna check out\nAnd says I mentioned a hundred and fifty dollars but some of the cool things that can do can turn it into a digital picture frame you're not using it there was no camera onboard either so if you're a privacy conscious and keep that in mind but when it is a digital picture frame it taps into all your photos that you have up in the cloud and Google Photos again good Christmas present for those Android folks on your list\nAnd one of the cool things about the new Google products is maybe just maybe a stop to all the robo callers and those scammers because here's the deal the new cook Google Pixel phones are going to screen your calls to stop the robo callers and scammers\nAnd Apple's linked to the game but they this past week said oh we're going to kind of have that they filed a patent called detection of spoof call information\nIt is going to enable an iPhone to check whether the calls legitimate and if not you can get a call alert no ring no vibrations got a check against established legitimate call parameters but it's not there right now so come on apple and let's get it in gear\nAnd speaking of new phones Samsung says we had the greatest phone ever and I may not be for you but it's for the so called Instagram generation it's for the selfie obsessed ... great\nSamsung's new smartphone they say is the world's first a feature not one not to not three but four count them four rear cameras\nThe a nine as a twenty four mega pixel main camera also has a telephoto ultra wide angle and ... is a is not cheap it's seven hundred twenty five bucks thing about new ads slogan for Samsung\nShameless self promotion as an under appreciated art form let's fix that same time we've been putting out fires for years [noise] All right this final story as a total mystery\nThink about this if you're wearing a smart watch is keeping track of your beats per minute well how exactly does that work what is going on why would a fitness tracker detect a beating heart\nOn a roll of toilet paper that's what you heard me right a roll of toilet paper if you put your smart watch on a roll of toilet paper\nIt will say that it's beating eighty one beats per minute\nI tried it out myself Chinese tech site advocates report this past week the toilet paper is having a viral moment because fitness tracker owners have discovered they just play a heart rate when attached to her role\nThey also tested others cylinder object a bottle a can a banana even an appendage of a stuffed animal all of which showed this mysterious Santa heartbreak ...\nAs I mentioned the toilet paper a BPL of eighty one a coffee mug at a BP em ups Seventy two a banana Seventy two beats per minute [noise]\nAnd it's not just other fitness trackers also the apple watch the Android where similar results here's the deal to detect a heartbeat trackers former green light on your

say Hi intellect in value did okay [noise] um he wants to talk about Kanye West\nYes but it's more of the tax side\nOf the Kanye West I mean we're we're not getting into politics not at all at all love I'm Adam whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to ... phone\nFirst of all we learn Kanye West uses a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states gifts\nOkay when you're in law that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his pass code correct okay can you guess what his past let me give you a hint very similar\nTo yours well you know I have I saw that them alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was\nZero zero zero zero zero zero correct to figure out which you know that used to be\n[laughter] so where where did you change it this morning I saw them [laughter]\nAnd so now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven seven seven seven seven seven that's far from over there oh yeah right much harder [laughter] the other thing\nThat the Internet was criticizing calling us for tax wise was that he had his phone in a case I won't be the big deal about\nThat it's not cool it's no longer cool down your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kid that are being 'cause those of us that have to shell out a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want it to shatter if I drop and\nThe criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need the case on the back unless you have a mole for you that's gonna charge you had there is no reason to have a case well that's what the Internet was attacking other stupid okay\nHere's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty okay mine's pink mine's black okay but the reason why it's pink is so that when I throw it into my black per se\nI can find so that's why if you got one like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse few I guy with a\nRose gold phone and the only I for some of blows bad case on anyway what does it\nMatter so we were talking about communist password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero there was a call for everyone to\nI and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and log in and then just try the password password one two three because odds are that's what his passport is\nSo then came out the stories about horrible past for us to have and I learned something which is surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking you've never heard a password walking never\nThat's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter in your past where\nMost popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are okay that's the top row and the bottom row and you walk\nWith your fingers across ... and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight down to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is worse to row\nAnd let me tell you something if you were to just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass what exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary got word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords oh I'm Sorry I don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nLike what was your a second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's wonderful\nTo choose to have verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password\n'cause it's been six months and they used it but if I have an a Yahoo apple my phone they send me a message through the app and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the OSCE yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nI'm gonna tell you something now my space and linked him yes they bowls since two thousand and sixteen if I've huge security breach\nOr you know in their website ... can you guess in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in the morning and\nThis is really a tough one I don't know if these two stories are connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde hair [laughter]\nMy space and linked in yeah just use it as their password but wasn't that much bang that's probably the these are brands of so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nHustle and

hello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that function something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using a nap or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nIsn't there an easier way to do that by having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer the shit\nHere's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday surfing\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nI see if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yeah so we used to fly you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes\nAnd we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word bank called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and\nNo charge and so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work I work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures bang we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animations\nAnd so so in to the next time you have a task put in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop\nNote through the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single do that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system

a\nQuestion and it's okay to all ... all along reputation management mhm let's be like what with me the best ... that I can fall fall small medical all this\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you ... and then the F yelled at search engine optimization ethical would all all all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\nWell the problem with them or if it's obviously what most of us have as you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out rides with a bad review balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people have experience it's usually doesn't go on line opposed to the\nPositive experiences with you at your business so when I'm Out here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay [noise]\nIs I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as it as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing to tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right\nAnd so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the\nMedical while it's like ... grade that car okay all day like settled\nOkay so okay a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt and says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that and you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you help on line and\nJust dropped some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then we'll also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay\nUm there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business\nYou'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore so\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to\nAccentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire
