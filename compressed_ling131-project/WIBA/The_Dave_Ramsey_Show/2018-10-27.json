us off the list because we didn't go yeah this one wasn't us no no\nThirty one Seventeen the final from Evanston today I\nWant to hear from your bedroom should open up now eight six six eight nine to eight to five died one eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine also while you can email us ... dot com hit us up on Twitter as well the post game poll question he's already up and our poll question is after watching\nThis game today who do you blame or what do you blame most for the badger season so far he's at injuries he used to be offensive sense\nThe depth lack of experience or Scott wanted to throw in one more withdrew in Gary Anderson right [laughter] we posted this about I don't know our ago so far forty three percent say it's the fence and twenty nine percent say it's ... you know\nObviously today there's multiple things right and it's not any one particular thing there there was a ton of things out there today that that didn't go well obviously for Scott's turnovers penalties inopportune stuff I'm that way a defensive with Heather back against the wall because of turnovers in position they were at this\nYou're going down the line and and there's a number of things that you can check off that way just not a good day for Wisconsin today and um your policy in in ... and might say two hats off to northwestern they came ready to go in and they took it to us flat out they took it to us\nToday it's interesting too when you say they came ready to go when you and I talked about bad I'm Blake fourth quarter as we watch the game again together today this team all year long have not I can't think of one game they had a fast start\nHitting the only one that that when you think about ... ... ... I probably the most ... fleet game\nAnd this might be a stretch that I felt good about at least watching the start of it was Iowa there was a sense of ... right energy right\nIt may not translate into the play the entire game but the way they came out there in it I thought they battled back before they were an answer Iowa\nWe didn't see it against BYU um we didn't see it certainly today we started I mean where do you see it in the non conference games in the season we saw with with today with the touched on that angle scored I mean I I started to see something okay we've got some things going here right\nAnd then the wheels fell off a and it wasn't just one at a time it was all for home at the same time and that was hard to watch because\nThe guys give effort and then you could just see they started to get beat on starting to get defeated and then they just knew or finding a way just to try and finish the game I mean the northwestern quarterback today Scott was picked off three times when you look at Clinton's ... numbers\nAnd you lay them on top of Jack ... numbers I'll just given to you cone today twenty or thirty one one fifty eight and a touchdown Clinton ... Seventeen of thirty one sixty seven and a touchdown but he was picked up three times right\nAnd we didn't do anything with us yet nothing in even first out those were almost ... twenty yards if if I start right we're almost a wash\nIt was colonel risen in location where they were still on the fence as Iraq against the wall ton I'm In north western ... they they have ... blood in the water right the shark kind of lurking around that they could feel that they can sense that in and they punched in when they needed to it it's one of those things that\nYou don't have an answer to why if if you did have an answer or the coaches and that sort of the players had an answer they could fix it\nIt's one of those things that it it just went bad and it got worse as the game went on and then\nAgain the guys are trying their practice and hard there's a ton of injuries but you can't use that as a as an excuse to you have to find ways to compete and if he can compete and lose that's OK today I didn't think that we competed uh to finish the game is one of the things too I was thinking about as we've done this for such a long time together and special teams\nAnd you said in past years if we say your name on special teams and you're not either the kicker for the return man or the guy making attack or the or the guy make an attack or we don't want to know who you are you know we discovered some new ones yeah there were three guys today we're not going to name their names\nBut you don't want to read those penalties came a huge times I mean we had one of our longest returns of the year right those notes I because of a penalty right we had a roughing the kicker you know what maybe give 'em half an hour I had her for that to me that was one of your grace but they got the call\nAnd that kept that drive alive northwestern went on at scored yeah the margin for error for this team and mad and like I said this and it's so true because of the injuries and everything else\nIt is so razor thin so those little things get magnified with a team like well it\nWas thin to begin with even with people healthy at the beginning of the year right now you have a number of guys heard so there's a lot of youth that it's playing or or inexperienced guys might be a senior even playing but it's an experienced a play\nAnd that's where that becomes even to a finer line that ... that you have to walk and\nUm you know here in Wisconsin where we talk about ice ice fishing and then I said well we're kind of feeling of water right now getting around her and I was ... it and it can happen hurt in a hurry and with this week coming up now they have to forget about this and the seniors have to step up coaches apt to step up you've got rockers come into the town\nNext week that it in a very good football program you got to come out perform you've got to find a way to get that mojo back\nSomething positive back where you can build the rest of the year ...\nThere's Penn State there's Purdue there's Minnesota it doesn't get any easier down the stretch here so this is one that's going to hurt and it should hurt but you've got to find a way to recover and and\nUh that that bus ride back from northwestern is going to be a long run I Wonder if today's game unfolded how many badger fans out there\nWho have been begging the quarterback wish they had their quarterback back in this game very question yeah we need to pause ten seconds for a station identification stations all along the network ten seconds for an ID Mrs badger football from their field\nPattern stature and

fabulous no\nIt's spelled those pizza whether it's in the desert taco style stuff the secret is salvage rather see them in the whole school stone\nThis isn't fabulous pizza it's just tastes are\n\nFound those pizza Macon\nLooking for a snow blower and it's easy to handle\nDriveway so ... for you see all the innovative colonel snow blowers at your ... dealer in sun ... hours Saturday for decades since the Iran small\nThirteen ten telling you I BA\nWalking back before most game show continues to what is it a kind of resembles the badgers overall him as a kind of dark and ...\nAge six six eight nine to five nine eight six six eight nine to eight to five ... if you want to jump in with his got also are close game ... question on Twitter badger post game as they hit a what do you blame most for the ... season so far injuries\nThe offensive against the death lack of experience or we threw in Gary Anderson uh right now thirty percent said see offensive office and thirty percent sea it's the depth the lack of experience [noise]\nInteresting surprised by that you know a time now for our Wisconsin corn growers homegrown in Wisconsin award winner or not the star of the game but the best Wisconsin native of the game [noise]\nYou know the two of us yeah\nBuddy Guy structure going with a couple of running backs without allegation gold and the out of Green Bay a continues to when they ask him to score touchdowns\nFor Kerry's twelve yards today so not a lot there but punched another one in early in the game and then your girl she thought a with the lack of production from Jonathan Taylor and a couple of phone calls that we ended up leading to team in rushing to the seven carry sixty yards don't touch downs but\nHe continues to perform a lot of those two guys as far as recognizing kids from Wisconsin to the nice jobs and they said the came into this game either the leading Russia in college football as the U.S and he was held a hundred yards blows average coming you know\nNot a good day at the game and out over a hundred of the season but show up to the phones we started in West bend can is up first can walk into the Ford post game show\nTheir gentleman a pleasure to be back I'm with ya I ah have made it all the sudden the call and giving us a badger team the opportunity to live up there or Frank Billy\nIt's been difficult this team was predicated on being ranked board and potentially a national championship bit because of one thing boys what was that offensive line how does this year\nI I I think he asked that and I think also the Orange Bowl for for a performance had a lot to do with it too\nI I Would agree with that a ... performance in that particular game was outstanding Taylor's yeah Taylor Taylor's was as well they are not having their top receiver back this year was a huge losses\nAnd if anybody thinks different you're absolutely groupie for a couple of reasons not only does he blocked good down field but he's a deep breath yeah and and when you put those together\nThat helps not only off at the wind it helps horny ... because he's always looking for him he knows when he's in trouble who's going to go to when they need a big play down the hill who is you're going to go to\nAnd they don't have that right now they're so one dimensional everybody knows that makes it difficult because nobody stepping up the penalties are difficult\nSpecial team stinks\nAt some point in time these young players are going to have to step up and make a difference and you guys have hit it on the head and at this point in time Paul Chris\n... you know he's doing the best we can with what he's got this these players need to step up if they want to be on a Big Ten team in a big ... conference on the on the biggest stage of all\nAnd at some point in time guys things have changed I Know they will it's frustrating from your standpoint my standpoint the players\nEverybody involved but it'll change so you just gotta hang in there things are going to get better\nI liked a a Ken thanks for the call I like to always started getting into it and then kind of low rent and then brought it back like hey we'll be okay freight patients part of it is the hard part for us as fans right where we had expectations and and\nPlayers had higher expectations probably what we did because they felt good about summer conditioning and how that came out of the Orange Bowl like you mentioned all those things but\nUm yeah the old line has been performed I Will guarantee you up to what they want certainly seep is doing about that he made a choice and he's in trouble with things now and until that shakes out we may not ever steam here again right so you have to go on like he had a season ending injury or career ending injury right so you got to put that aside from the penalties\nIn opportunity without a doubt on special teams and things that really cost us a lot of fuel position and put our defense in a hole and put her often in a whole lotta time to get a bigger return to end up going back to forty yards um that's hard to do in a lot of those are things today that we could not overcome\nAll right let's hit one more I'm just a known as sitting here on my screen that we're going to hear a bit from a pollen his press conference after Tom in Greenfield time will come in today to the Fort wrap up show what's on your mind\nYeah without that brought you could see how that plays like you say it's one that won the ... what's the third quarter for that yet and we uh\nOver from when we started coming to you all are kind of a roof into kicker some of the state for stuff like that you know what maybe had had the format of proud of our that's Fifteen minutes and that third\nQuarter you know what you're going to what you ain't gonna win games or Rutgers\nNext week probably oh and what the other three games after that a toss up probably probably about ... but we don't go to all I think\nWell eh well hold on now if we win one more and you become ... eligible right so let's not lose sight of that time I appreciate your phone call by the way Scott\nI read this to you before we come on what before it came on I'm Sorry bad grammar and my partner before we came on today by this was an email that were sent to us at the end of last week's show okay\nSo I I I Want to share this now because it's it's sitting right so I'm not going to say who wrote it to us all a buddy who writes in Bastille line and college question mark last running back in college right\nNever watch Ohio state's quarterback Haskins is good but compared to horny brought he is a man above a first grader Wisconsin needs to develop a new quarterback\nIt is too late to develop pony broke Chris is delusional for not pitching horny Brooke why are so many sports reporters blind Pearl I Love to hear your rebuttal or not your rebuttal but you reply to what you win this today\nI'm In the development of ... ... again he he's won a lot of games for us right I'm Kenny improve absolutely we all know that he knows that I'm coach Chris knows that um I think you saw why we haven't seen jak going out there um\nToday's is first start that's a hard position to be in finding out early in the week that hey this is your team now you've got to go\nUm there's a lot that comes at you and he didn't have a lot of support around them as far as production in the wrong game guys catch it passes protection all those things they had their back against the wall multiple times ... broke today because I yeah I did two more so than I Do poised that that I see him when mistakes happened\nAnd I don't I didn't see black enough on TV but then when you carry it is it is thirty some games as a starter now it is it's it's unfair to rip tone today either like the people are saying he's got to play well he played today All right but listen you and I were talking about these two ... got to start because bart Houston was struggling\nBecause Alex showed in practice that no one gets to see\nAfter training camp wraps up right that he deserved if bart continue to struggle he was going to get some snaps obviously jak has not shown that or they have not lost faith in Alex ... yeah and I think there's a lot of trust with the guys are on the on the field with them right I can see the frustration in\nA jail for a couple of times he was over shot right now we're already over I was able to do so\nAnd again often some you have to be able to produce ... I think we were thirty percent on third downs in northwestern was fifty percent\nThat's how you keep drives going you your progress than you and you move on if you can't move the sticks on third down\nIt's a long day for your office and even longer for your defense cause you keep putting them back out that we talked about a two week we were we read you the stats are the two quarterbacks today they are virtually all differences is that source and made plays when he had two\nAnd a cone just did not yeah three three interceptions that we didn't capitalize on his way to do more than this game today and you know play defense\nIf you have to play defense with the team starting in the thirty compared to a teen starting at the five when the ten or Fifteen it's much ... yeah it is he in in even in your own side of the football right there in ... side are fifty a number of different times when you start and that's\nThat's a hard spot to be in your ... against the wall already I thought the defense for as many places are out there held up as long as they could\nWhy in the world would we try a fifty two yard field goal which which meant nothing when we needed to hopefully convert there and get seven points made no stop\nRick thanks for the call you know a couple of things uh GT annual lined up at ... I don't have an answer for you on that either that one's perplexing to me and I think some of that just attitude right being hungry and and being a little bit nasty and down and dirty and ... and and working at it we've seen flashes where they're really good and\nIt just hasn't been consistent on that kind of been again are seen throughout the course of the season\nUm as far as when you kick and when you don't it's kind of a dime a dozen right there there is an opportunity to get points on the board you know your real in a little bit situational stuff coaches talk about those things but\nWe do we call a timeout than we called time what do we go forward on Fort than one don't we do we go for it you know back and forth those conversations happen and then doing I tell you that that's what they felt was the best choice did that particular time and\nThere's times during the game that you and I were talking to him right like I'm not sure I Would have done that are ... there's always an opposite side too especially if it comes to like when it doesn't work it works like gutsy color or that was stupid right but um I I don't have an answer for that one that that that one's scratching my head a little bit too\nLet's get an email real quick John rights when you guys do a great job\nBut I have to disagree in one small point it's kind of the same thing we were just talking about\nUm in reference to the offensive line he said I Do not believe that quit to seafood is blocking is a reason for a Koran gave me must half of last season including the ball game and they remain productive\nI think Troy ... missed more agreed I remember the last of the other is Zander noble brave that hurt a bunch of ... he was talking about that during the broadcast today\nHe said the real problem in his mind this is John is highly regarded dolphins would wind which is not perform up to expectations wrecking Chicago just as much\nThis and it's reaching critical airs in my judgment have really hurt this team the quarterback position is mediocre in a mobile which also limits some options on often a let's hear from some of the offensive line right now let's get back to Evanston\nMichaela are standing by with Michael Peter guys\nThese moments are tough or and your earlier you've been around here for a little bit them give me a sense of the ...\nThe law or whatever you lose All right are you going to do to come out when and [noise]\nHonestly the only really you can do is move forward because and I think I heard you know good\nReally all you can do is leaders make sure guys are forgetting about it learning what we need to learn from it and move on\nThis week went on and and knowing that as a veteran off in some on you're going to have a first time starting quarterback mind you but you had the whole week do you feel like that progress the way\nHe wanted it yeah I think if we're super confident jak was never any worries about first start anything like that\nLike you said we had all week to work so\nI mean that was all good on that and\nAs we look at this and listening to Paul in his press coach Christian his press conference so many of the things that went wrong today we're self inflicted that that's a difficult\nDeal at the end of the day to know that many times it was on your cell fencing\nTeam yeah it is it's definitely easier to to play a good football game and lose then pretty bad football game I mean when you know you put it all out there and everything went smoothly and just at the end of the day they outrageous [noise]\nI guess it's a little easier to swallow but when you know there was just so much some stuff that you sent shooting yourself in the foot turnovers all that makes it that much worse 'cause you know you don't want to just clean some stuff up the games years but\nI guess we'll find out until you as you roll forward but is there a challenge to not lose the season in a moment like this as it plays forward [noise]\nNo I don't think so I don't think I guess that's what everyone personally but I think the same\nAs the goal is where the ... ton of seasons laying around anything yeah there's a lot of stuff that can happen and we just got to go in football game and that's got to be the mindset is going to have all games at the end of the year we still have\nWe can do is control actually sit here\nAnd think oh season's over anything and that's a really bad rhetoric digging into\nHis office on collective nobody feel sorry for your when something like this happens right I mean this is where you kind of internalized that\nYeah and sometimes people don't get as much attention to kind of forget about child whatever those guys and then all we can do is key words maybe\nYou've had less less pressure people aren't feeling sorry all that stuff um but it's nice you know like you said everyone just seems a rally around each other on this team and and that's it that's how many\nMichael thank you back on us\nYou know what I listen to that you know what I hear ...\nI hear leadership yeah I hear I hear you know a strong voice and you know some of the voice that you were talking about that maybe this team has right now and we're not inside the locker room I mean you were I mean do you still are as as as as a coach\nOr you need guys like Michael Peter don't show the other times like this you ask a guy like Michel teeter to speak up and\nSometimes you don't even need to ask some time and they just do it and sometimes it's as simple as going to those young guys and putting your arm around and say we're me All right we've got to work harder but we're going to be All right um\nAnd you can hear his voice he's he's heard pride um he energy I just thought yeah he did a tremendous job in a in a difficult situation in Iraq and that's the maturity to Toyota to handle the media that way and and understand that and that's again that\nIt's enjoyable to hear him it's fun to hear him when they when right did you hear that excitement in their ... it's hard to listen to one that lose but uh maybe those guys are sometimes you gain a little bit more respect when you hear him when they lose or you\nKnow you have less respect when you win right but it it can be you know that I mean one of them is like and you you and I have talked about that all the time it was really hard\nFor you to have someone come up and ask you tough questions like that after a while after you've just given your all that way right and got flat out beat to be able to answer questions as hard and again that some maturity that way and and\nHis understanding of how this all fits in and then the season isn't done they have more games to play and they have to figure out how to get their minds right for next week [laughter]\nTime now for the pioneer Brandi ... impact you know the the game that goes today to\nTell the wonderful special teams\nFor electoral in you know what he wore a special teams they disappoint you when you see this guy was right again a lot of it is just taking it to heart rate this is my opportunity to make an impact on the team to have to feel position to whatever the case or there's one particular play\nAnd I don't remember who was but we held northwestern forced upon\nWe get a hold and call at the wind a scrimmage well it's a funny guy we've never heard\nFrom ... or kick it down I think the boy I Want to stay with like maybe at the ... I don't remember exactly where it was a member on the forty six yard line right well that penalty happens holding peddling instead of starting with diesel fuel for the longest returned\nThe season on way on another one right no I live on that one twenty two year old retired so you go through that now instead of having decent feel position now you're starting at what your own six eight nine year old and I'm like that the study that they ate our first play then for a scrimmage\nWas cold with all the oil will double yeah boy oh boy we lose that and in Fort Wayne Slater both northwestern punches even at that point the game it's twenty four to ... and you're not out of it no\nI Know you're still in this book is despite all the mistakes you have a chance though\nThat we feel good about a sitting here people at home probably not just by watching that game unfolds it's still a long road to go but at least you got a chance to turn it back over now it's thirty one to ten games and and it's done so as quickly that happened and I think that fuel position and the ... in the special teams game today\nReally cost about Twitter pogo post getting Paul ad badger post game what do you blame most for the ... season so far injuries off that's often steps lack of experience or Gary Anderson forty two percent putting it on the shoulders of the office twenty five percent the debt the lack of experience and\nFor ... and hanging in there with Seventeen percent of the book All right we'll take her final time out to have some titled thought badgers fall in Evanston today was not pretty thirty one Seventeen is your final say whether it's this is badger football from ...\nWhy Dr an ordinary car when for the same monthly payment you could be driving something extraordinary Aaron Perkins general managers in brick European imagine yourself behind the wheel of a Mercedes Benz Audi Porsche or safety performance and luxury and way more fun and getting more cost less than you'd think limerick European makes leasing affordable\nDiscovered the value for yourself stop in and test drive a Mercedes Benz Audi Porsche today visits in brick European and find out why leasing the card your dreams makes so much sense\nFor you know it seems to start a little earlier\nToward the flu it's never too soon to get your flu shot at high D get your flu shot or early ... sell some worry plus when you get your flu shot and I mean you can save twenty cents a gallon on gas with your feet you'll have a car and\nThere's no avoiding necessary to get your flu shot today at ... and get your twenty anti beef you'll say British guy some restrictions apply\nUse our end people are much more and girl for ... on their favorite team for sports fans that among perjury she's turned on the perfect hair a much much more in girls the best place for watching the game with friends and family who menu items so much barn grilled chicken looks bar and grill not compromise for\nTwenty five years and then making everyone\nCelebrate that will be\nOther top twenty five games in progress right before a happy time Georgia leading Florida in seven that's a big game out of the FCC east Oklahoma they got on at Kansas State then\nTyler Murray doing ... thing\nI learned from the CD wide open [noise]\n\nIt'll be rolling on the Oklahoma radio network from Larry field daily Kansas State twenty four to seven with about six minutes remaining in the first ...

I thought he really gave us all today but making a statement that things are pretty much the same when we don't have Alex ... quarterback\nInside the thirty two twenty nine and a lot of badger dean thanks very agent early turn on\nYou know the bond market can play a little bit of yet to start to adoptions\nBy the bell street to keep growing now he's doing All right doing All right uh that was our electric all of the game it's tough to find a way to beauty that it went through a touchdown right to capitalize on that and again funded opportunities to get better in and help your office out but I'm not enough today for Scott's\nEight seven seven to three five Thirteen tend let's go the phones John he's up next on the veteran football post game show John what's on your mind today\nI I'm just maybe an observation maybe you can comment on it seems like the wrong because they were making and selling mentioned this was a well no they make contact alliance and let me I still watch\nBut the northwest not only that was able to push but under the Orioles after after he got every rotten and I'm just wondering if there were some\nDeficiency in in ... or something when they when the defense was making the like the national debt but right through maybe\nI guess yeah thanks for the call John I think there was a number of times\nRooted stuff from behind discouraged or at least at the line of scrimmage I don't know if they fell for it every time but the one thing that you make sure you take a look at when when you watch that stuff is a lotta times defenders that are coming down hill I'm are being blocked were running back it doesn't have any ... that he's touching so you're trying to disengage from walking around the block over the top underneath\nWherever you need to go and so you're at a disadvantage trying to to make to tackle I'm\nNot that that's an excuse but running backs of a free downhill run a junior trying to defeat alignment or another of running back ... fleet blocking and uh just something to watch next time or what no matter what game it is um those guys defender the defenders or a little disadvantage when it's right at the point of attack\nFor your call John time now for another locker room report brought to aspire friends with county safety county safety keeping the badger state safe\nFor over Seventy years tough day today tried to run down hill but uh just had a tough day a couple of phone calls as well Jennifer Taylor um you know how as we said Scott held a hundred yards below his average coming in leading Russia in the country\nAre going to this game today and you thought that you don't want all things aside he would have a big day I Jonathan Taylor ... unfortunately the bad Jonathan Taylor that we haven't seen for quite a while he surface today or one of many things that went wrong for the Wisconsin badger in Evanston after the game he stood up and talk to our own Mike ...\nThese are tough days JT you haven't gone through many of these personally how do you handle a moment like this\nIs tough to handle things like this coming here\nKnow having a type of data we had actually coming off the type of game that we can and\nYou know with this outcome is definitely tough and you got to look at what got you through last hundred years in a situation which was you know there there's a lot in common for more so you got to keep playing every single week in order to give yourself\nFirst chance possible move for personal\nFrustration you always him seemed to me to be up leads to that is is this personally challenging in a moment like this for you\nAnd this is definitely personally towns you know\nYou never want to lose a game I was always tough but\nYou know especially on the calendar team now we are\nPlants were definitely frustrating my work\nPhone bill ... conversation we've had not so much this year but what can you tell me on the two today\nJak person rents are we so we were comfortable there's ... you know we're executing together\nDown but you got to just make sure they can come underneath you and get it\nAs a as a sophomore\nSometimes you're not viewed as a leader I actually think you probably are leader on this team do you take that as a personal charging challenge to roll this forward so that you guys as a team don't lose the season because of where you are in the moment I\nThe season that I had last year and you know guys you know probably to look into me seeing you know how I respond to a situation like this and\nYou know see if I'm going to look down on them I'm not going to do that at all because noticed would collect things are moving we're all do things that we can get better and we all done good things so just try to make sure I keep a positive attitude into guys you know we have to keep working Johnson thank you for that company yes\nAll right good stuff my killer into here it's his money to day like\nToday yeah he does have an inherent JT talk you know\nHe said and my point fingers he knows he ... he knows the expectations of people have of him and he knows what he wants to do to win and\nAgain a sophomore true sophomore so Nineteen years old maybe twenty um Saddam maturity grown now okay now the play has to to improve right and I know it's got to be consistent and he's been consistent through these first seven\nThis one was a rough day for for a lot of different guys and\nAgain you can hear the voice the frustration they're sad they're upset I'm putting those there's next week come into and he's got to get ready and prepped for Rutgers\nOr by the way to the Twitter verse out there ... even though we played quarterback at Amherst is not gonna play quarterback for the badgers anything that was all over the place and neither will T.

Edwards on down the line right on time for a player of the game brought to us by Carlos ... sons you'd want to keep Dane County exact leader for over eighty years\nYeah so all these that we looked at today right it's a stretch I'm\nThe one thing that stuck on my mind was a touchdown pass a to Kendrick prior a running basically an inroad slant route whatever you want to call it\nA in the end zone and and when going through a little behind them but he got himself in front of the defender um made the reception ended up with for catches for fifty two hours on the day held longest reception of the day at Eighteen\nOr and then one touched down and and I get in trying to find some bright spots in a tough day like this I I just thought that was heads up for a difficult pass a position for him to get and he went and got it\nOn a show back to the ... brothers pizzeria line eight seven seven to three five Thirteen tents Scott is up next on the bedroom football post game show Scott what's on your mind\nWhat you got the tone of the day was that would that have you come out that was funny was it it it was great I Love I Love the response\nFrom Hillary low key that was great\nIt was terrific but less less funny for me was that we had to burn a timeout\nBefore the very first off the scrimmage after receiving the opening kick oh yeah I have ever seen that before\nThat makes probably three of us right multiply by a lot yeah Joe's holding his hand up\nSo that's why I Can't see arm and I guarantee he's here at the end of the era that six yeah\nIt just I'm almost sixty years old I watch way too many would never seen that one yeah\nYeah that that were scratched my head to\nOne other question would be for you guys and I really enjoy your show\nThe office of blind way everybody just appointing but I just wonder if at any point program might look at look at shifting the coaching staff\nTo take anything away from Rudy status on that that guy can go chop supply\nJust back yeah you know there's always different changes happening throughout the year right or throughout after seasons are done we saw Jim one or get a recruited so to speak right that he was sought after after last season\nI Would guess at different points a lot of these guys are if they're looking to move up and and if they want to become a coordinator if they're from a coordinator to a head coach\nUm those are all discussions and things that the coaches have to have um the Paul has to have I'm sure very it'd be involved in that and thinking about making a switch what do you think um what can we do for bringing somebody in to replace\nUm Rudy is really good coach with that often aligned to and he was a big part of that ... was wrong because I think he was really cogent titans are at that point um will they make a change I don't think so I think there's a lot of trust between all those guys and I think the linebacker play you see the type of coach that the boost that is right that\nHe's able to switch to the defense of side of the ball he's just having a huge impact that way because he understands you off its ally play and how do I combat that as soon it fits really well\nNot at that level but I mean you you're a high school coach okay and you have a specific piece of that team you're coaching right but you know that there's other coaches on the staff that may have coached defense or they might have coached office\nAnd maybe they're not coaching that now but you guys communicate or you talk you know that those guys are going back and forth well and if I remember\nI listen to a lot of college coaches that when you go to different clinics and thanks for your dolphins coach you talk to your defense of guys what are we doing what are you picking out that we need to correct what is your work work back and forth how can I defend against\nThis off how can we beat you defensively using this scheme for sure there's always communication that way and those ... I mean it's a position that you're coaching but that talk happens quite frequently\nSo as as we played at the beginning you know just the whole broadcast kinda got up to a bad start but around eleven thirty around eleven thirty in this building things took a quick change everything got better everybody had a smile on their face why Scott showed up with the in space\nThat's right Joel got his macaroni and show it would be one of those greeting I've had a long time you wouldn't believe the archer you got your pepperoni pizza yeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs going to sit on the other side I mean is there a point where the defense looks at the office and in in in ... I'm ... I mean I don't know you guys came home and other dogs are more Columbia\nYeah there there's some guys are probably still a few things like you know another third now you run off the boys were just made one first to how\nIt was just one first down the risk to recover right you know you didn't break 'em or you know there's a lot of ... it works or not an serious race right that's right um yeah it gets Russia and the hard part is mentally you know you're you're getting beat right typically when that happens in the game\nUm and that's hard physically it's hard emotionally and\nWhat was your team it shows you know you hang out with those guys some over your really good friends are and again it's not like they're trying to you know at some point they're going to have to do take your cover up some of the things mistakes you may so\nYou have to be careful with that but yes certainly when when that happens over and over and over\nA ... I don't call descendents so much between the team I think it's just flat out frustration guys were doing all we can you can can lead to old X ray or a certain amount of us are right and that's again we're coaches come in and leadership that we've heard some from some of these guys talk how do you handle that manage out and stay together as a group\nA sewer defensive player of the game brought to respond games or company remember kids raised the answer for all your exterior remodeling project since Nineteen thirty nine chemical linebacker maybe yeah I and like I said with the Ryan Calo away in the job or are going to continue to show up in a week and a week out um and\nWe need to play from them or as banks will get back and things like long improved\nBut those two are are certainly the the stove or to the defense what's here a little bit from teacher you Edwards after we got caught up with my other after the game you're not going\nTo the chase on us when these are difficult times for leaders are challenging for leaders in year one of those ... moments like this rolling fall by\nUm I mean like I said I think it's very tough in a way to get jobs and just coming together um extra cash to Amtrak I think the biggest host Chris it on that was really important is just finding a way to look at yourself um\nSee how you can get better you know making better off really and I think some of the best one I forgot how\nSo many in the moments today then decided in the game more self inflicted pass interference in the end zone and the Russians upon our you know how to use and what did you get off the field and more down what you don't get off the ceiling\nYeah um I mean I think the guys that are like crazy and I'm honestly like you said they raised their stuff what you're saying so things where you can look for in the hour we'll make a mistake and a lot closer ball game is a\nWhich has a you know find a way not going to be running for somebody and good teams are down the stretch or you're not you're not going to games on the\nBigger picture question I asked Michael due to the same thing so I'm I'm as a leader he is there a challenge and not lose this season as your role for an awful awful\nPerformance like this yeah I think it's very easy for a lot of guys kind of look for say oh you know we've lost three games um\nYou know an hour we want to be so I think it's very easy for people to kind of going to home\nAnd things like that but um I Know from just the seniors in the leadership standpoint as our last shot at it um\nHow do we just wanting to myself why like that happen to anyone on the theme song or something like that and all the rest of the guys will will as well as a nation that doesn't happen you\nCalm brought things together and going into this week no one on on the other side of the fall but no you don't want an average starting quarterback in this game did that change the demeanor the temp for any of the leading up\nI don't think so I think a defense we knew we were we really want to start out kind of situations just like we've ever again like um you know I thought maybe they could top man in the game obviously mistakes made by everyone I'm Around by the biggest thing\nI Want him to put that on him self at all or anything like that it's just that the same thing where you didn't do enough to get things done but um nothing really changed in our game plan and we were ready to go to the final\nThoughts are ... it's important to not use injuries as an excuse but injuries are\nPart of what you guys have had to go through how how you handle it and how challenging is that\nYeah it's a it's always about especially in this game football Saturday you know they're going to happen um\nTopsy want guys out there seniors who um\nYou know maybe place for us in the past but I think the guy says that they have done you know I've tried their very best to do that as well\nAnd you can't really blame those guys I mean I think as a unit on both off at the front special teams we have to look at ourselves and try to get better than a man who matter no matter who was out in the field to jail it's\nAppreciate it thank you Rebecca ...
