fall on his hand I think just overall and and [noise]\nI mean you've got to have an officer why too right so they they did much better today but some of the things that these guys are able to do and go out of the house and moved to get free [noise] I think they just performed really really well to help control the water's criminals to help control the temple the game and and really wanting the

think some of the players are on the field ... up in Michigan guys or stop on his scraping all those forty head on the field and so there is no love lost all their news about Twenty one step in Michigan leading Michigan State with two forty eight ball game court break\nTo me gets those guys ready to play he is passionate he cares about his players they buy into what he's saying and you hear the the old term like I'm going to run through a brick wall wearing those guys will come\nIn and it's fun to watch when players beat up the passion of their coaches and he's passed it on the side you

play at Northwestern he was in a lime and\nThen got looked at me and I go to all the northwestern guys that go yeah I was wondering [laughter]\nRivalries they'll run out of the time that I just the way it is All right so let's put it\nQuick 'cause we were able to take away from today's we get ready for next with again consistency from me both opposites on defense tackling getting things done or we need to continue with the turnout was those were huge forest today and that's a rallying point for fans to get behind the team for our guys to go with it but trying to get people back on that side of the fall off\nAnd simply the consistency in the wrong and making sure that carries over this week the next week and finding ways maybe instead of taking shots down the fuel Tom what can we hid

with the fuel position because of a turnover momentum we saw what happens when we get in there you pick a ... a quick shot down the field\nScored a touchdown ... so you play off that stuff that energy and you try and hit them hard hit him when it hurts and no better time to do that when it with a big turnover from your defense\nOr buddy like look is posted this much wrote a few minutes ago on
