my counter standing by\nBedroom quarterback Alex ...\nLet me begin with I'm asking about [noise]\nIf there's any influence involved knew what it means to you to have a team back from twenty five years ago predates where you were born with that team kinda began Wisconsin's run to have them back this weekend\nYeah it's pretty ... definitely made a huge impact on the university and I'm kind of started in the tradition than we have here is to have those out there and it was best\nAbout getting back out there after the by weakened and against the ... the one that gave me some opportunities there\nYeah you just get out here I thought everybody had a lot of fun playing tonight [noise] um and competed\nAs you watch you know you're on the line work and Jonathan tailoring here in ... in

I'm\nOut on that sort of like I Love a lot of opportunities to do that and I'm the one real nice on a couple of nights and we can do together in Taiwan I Love the way they ran the ball and um they're aligned degrees we\nTalked about this throughout the season but this offensive line can kind of lean on defense than than it does seem that they did and it opened up more opportunities when can I can handle\nIt all starts to them and they did a great job of um one identifying although the defenses are coming out of and then just being physically I'm being more physical ... crossing\nWalk me through the touch down the road to for\nYou and I know the coach Christians excited on the sideline what did you see what was the design what was set up ...\nI'm Sorry we're just kinda going vertical and they didn't uh bring the safety over so is this the one on one with a backer and um he made a claim made them\nYou get a now after the by week this one which is what you wanted to do and now you go to Michigan how do you transition and go back on their own where you guys have been so much is that\nUm it'll be fun one that's the that's a tough environment and the um the tough opponent so we're excited\nAlex thank you back up to you guys\nThank you Mike Mike Heller with a bedroom quarterback ... ... um you know each each one of those things with Alex when you watch him play and all of his all of his strengths and weaknesses his claws on display in this game today\nI think bedroom fans would be easy to be critical of Alex in some of us deserved but I think in the end\nIt's about winning football games and how you do that is unimportant you just want to win football games yeah and I mean I mean there are things she has to clean up there's no doubt about that I mean his claws are there but the same time\nThey want the football game and I think that's the biggest takeaway for me that I just want to remind people not to forget yeah ... you know\nI think if you talk to him we can we go to is going to tell you get things to improve on because that's how you get better that's like being a competitor is um there are certainly things today that that he'd want back I think he did some really good thanks um I think overall the team did some really good things and overall they got things kind of today was\nNever felt that you know really super exciting let's go this is an awesome game from start to finish its kind of ebbs and flows through the whole thing and and\nUm that's okay you can win and put a points that way and and and take care of business at home and protect the house but that's a great thing um but understanding next week you're going to the big house right you're going over to Michigan and that then you got to get things right it and\nThe thing they can feed off his how will they played in a in a really good game against our back and forth all four quarters taking care of business today in and stay in ... with wherever they're at a uh I I think next week is going to be a really big telltale sign\nOf what type of team we really have there's a number injuries that they're going to have to be overcome on next week with those guys get back or not I don't know um but it's a young group is going out on a fuel next week in a big stage and they got to figure things out\nPretty quick you you've got to clean things up but I think your point is well taken about the injuries I mean we had one point we had Madison cone we had wild goose spray looking at my program going wild yeah yeah really aren't a wild goose drew freshmen as in the back in Britain is back there tonight right um\n[noise] you know you wanted to get Nelson kicked out for the rest of the half and half of the next year so humans are going to ask next week so there's there's a lot that's coming out of this week and then to come out I'm In a hurry and but again you come here and the expectation is that you went in those guys that aren't going to be a plane if they're hurt or their ineligible for whatever reason\nHas to help those young guys get up to speed in a hurry\nOne eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine one eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine we should remind you to the badgers didn't win the football game tonight we just want to stress that it's worth it so [laughter]\nYeah well it it's a good thing it was a great night forty ... twenty for the fun let's get a padded walking shot packed listening in tonight my friend how are you\nKnow from a notice the order tonight it's now the first baby Ninety nine ... years ago I I don't know how much time I got I got to go fast a\nFirst badger football game was probably Seventy seven uh my older sister was a freshman at mad town\nI think it was probably against the buckeyes or sitting in the upper deck on the west side ah\nWe probably lost maybe something like forty nine to seven um I'll never forget the first four I heard the stands though Ira Mathews I think he was number three ran a kickoff back for the red and white for the batters\nThat with our moment in the sun that day I was a student from eighty to eighty six a day McLean uh started turning around from Sandusky, Ohio I'm took ... games I was there for the past gain a rainy right to al tune to ah\nAh you know um but nothing compared to Ninety three feet and um I was in the north end zone in Michigan game Oh thanks to my sister and brother in law and my brother\nIt with your brother in law I should say I was also at stake gain the ... um I heard the song point and ah they\nBlocked the feel go on a number three I think Marlene Kerner came around the corner and pocket I remember her\nName was again a quarterback with the uh gr bok I remember the ... of it to remember a tumor the biggest thing I remember is the rose bowl I watch it on TV I'm Nellie when a mark Montgomery got\nTossed just an incredible uh you guys rallied um I remember a running and they could vote for that go ahead touchdown um I remember watching it with my dad was upstairs listen to us right now with him and my mom and my brother\nThe moments after this game but you know a trip to Michigan and that's always a little something special\nYeah um I mean I remember going back there and great atmosphere\nGames I'm sure it's going to be even better on very good aim of going against so really has to be a pay to play the best thing we play debate\nTunnel thought is the Big Ten west now you've got to wins again to western division teams where you want to be in a you know so as we talk about getting ready for mentioning you are where you want to be from at this point\nYeah we've responded well to it hurts the house the losing early on and I think that helps kind of build our building confidence and realize that we can just walk on the field and expected when\nYou know we're doing a good job of continuing to build and I don't think we fight are on the games um so we're going to be we TJ thank you very good\nBack up to you guys All right thanks by a TGI Edwards the leader of their linebacker core of the impact unit of the game sponsored by a pioneer brand new series soybeans next generation varieties developed to deliver a game changing your potential on your farm dupont pioneer with you from the word go\nGo Scott when we dive inside the statistics from this game tonight third down conversions the badgers had five hundred percent\nOr fifty percent I should say six ... really good is already getting like for the old man how good the six of twelve ... meanwhile and that deterrence three of pen for Nebraska and also for down chances that I'd never ask was off to one of those really costs got frost and\nYou wonder if he had to do with all over again what do you hold on for that yeah yeah yeah and I think that's when you look as coach the evaluate stuff do we put her kids in the best position\nUm to recall the replays et cetera but again I I think our defense stepped up the right time and sometimes you call a good play in the defense counteract it was a really good calls well hum but it's interesting you listen to teach it talk and\nUm I thought might did a great job of posing the question as opposed to saying you guys were not alive when the Ninety three team was yeah I appreciate how he worded that\nBut I I think they understand that and that's part of learning the history of the program where it was where we've come from um where these guys are currently Adam and again I'll says former players coming back and watch this but the expectation is that there's not a drop off and I think they they take that to heart\nUm and I saw that with some of their plate at night you know the I think that that after a week off it's hard to come back and play really lively spirited football and\nI think that showed itself a little bit here today but they worked rushed off of again again teaches one of the leaders he's really played himself and to be in the top notch linebacker in this league certainly a if not in the country um and it continues produced weekend a week out and\nAgain that's a good credit to his work ethic and his leadership but he puts out there with his team that\nHe's going to come each and every week with the same approach and he's going to produce a and the guys feed off that and they see that and I think they're really respect the\nFirst thing coming into this game one of the underlying stories was the undisciplined play by Nebraska are the most penalize team of the Big Ten if down and all of college football coming into this game right I\nMean when you watch the game from the brass standpoint you're like fella mean they've got skilled players they've got a tremendous young quarterback\nBut undisciplined this was a team again tonight\nStayed with what they've done to this point of the season ten flags for one hundred yards\nAnd we talked about momentum and the hurt the jerky play well I mean the badgers weren't you know a on blemish either they at five fifty so a lot of flags on the ground tonight but the brass true to form it's just very undisciplined in sloppy ... that say that you took away from a very skilled at unit offensively which which we knew\nThey had coming it right and so you know the yards they put up they had to pass the only game but they racked up almost Warner yards passing against the depleted secondary a but still you have to clean those things up that was one thing that it wasn't very first got here to for us\nBut you know if we refer back and make connections to our team that foolish penalties things at inopportune times you have to clean that up and that goes to expectation of understanding your job and doing it correctly\nUm and I think it's going to take a year or two for him\nThat in a brass go because they've had changed over these last few years to change the culture of that and coaches talk about all the time but\nThis is the expectation and we have to hold things to a certain standard and if I'm not mistaken some of the stuff that read over this last week he shook up a deft shirt guys aren't producing you're not going to play or you're gonna have to earn that time back\nThere has to be sound familiar oh yeah very true\nAnd people forget about that I mean berries first year how many games did he win one he wasn't one game yeah his Ball State yeah that was it I mean in in in in in your to your five and there was I wrote this year\nAnd then in your three was the breakthrough yeah I I think that the one game that that took us into the second year was Michigan State we we lost their should've had a touchdown catch that that could have beat him a team that was a top Fifteen theme of the country found we would go five and six again and\nAnd here you sit with a a a fumble against north western and that really rallied the troops I think guys stayed back and were motivated\nUm any challenge each other during that summer and I think that really catapulted us into Ninety three\nThese guys the expectations right out of the gecko right they didn't have the buildup moment or to do that this is produced now and that's what these young guys all have to realize as they get into this\nUh preparation for Michigan you're going in a tough environment against a very athletic team that's going to come after you and you have to be able to to rise up and goes to the mental approach physically I think they're skilled enough the mental approach is how do you adjust the the things that they go bad and how quickly director recover from\nThose quick email in two from up

range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout\nThis process is the positives that can be gained from all this how many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the last couple of weeks\nI haven't known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty and Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabinet ...\nOr ... that may on what he has been through and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nI'm Jeff pigs ... says NBC Sports radio [noise]\n\nUnderground bowels\nSomewhere on deliberate comes to your local number script still doing\nFor you once again based on guy for the\nBeen set up a focus on the future of the fortune right based on that concern that judge cabinet or\nWhat the CIA overturn roe v way\nProtecting this rate is ... ...\nThen she said ah Susan Collins dead but to hell with it a voting for him anyway [noise]\nKidding kitty kitty\nIn fact um it was one of the more interesting moments during the course of her fifty fifty five minutes speech earlier\nWhich again was\nI Believe the best the finest\nI have ever witnessed United States senator delivered I just\nIncredible incredible definitely something worth your while if you did not catch it early early early earlier today easy for me to say by the way I write about in for the great one more call to your friend here in South Florida I Do\nYeah morning show on WGN out west Palm Beach a mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always an honor and a pleasure to be here with you know one of the things about Susan Collins during the course of her dissertation you might have found some moments where you're wondering huh\nBecause Brett Kavanaugh really the conservative I thought he was the really the constitutional is I I thought he was not so sure anymore [laughter] I mean that was how good her depiction of Brett Kavanaugh was how thorough investigation was\nAll the folks she interviewed I mean she laid it all out there just remarkable and uh you know it might have some some questions about how he would end up rolling on things like say\nFor life matters and there is an important\nPoint within the pro life conversation here as well\nBrett Kavanaugh pretty evident being the good a Catholic Boy that he is he's pro life right\nBut does that necessarily mean that he brings that philosophy to the bench and doesn't doesn't necessarily hasn't as she pointed out based upon us some of what he has ruled on in stated previously\nAnd when we're traveling down this process you're learning things that you never would have otherwise known about Brett or about\nThe level of the investigation that took place with Susan but also what obviously was not done by so many other senators and this is where it's instructive\nFor you with the folks that are in your neck of the woods your senators how did they vote I'm here in Florida Marco Rubio you voted in favor of ending debate today will vote for Brett Kavanaugh out tomorrow Bill Nelson he voted no\nAnd by all accounts will vote no again tomorrow night he happens to be up for reelection this year he's up against our term limited governor Rick Scott who has been no less than the third best governor\nDuring his seven plus years as governor and the state of Florida just remarkable what he's done\nA but he's in a real horse race against Bill Nelson who's already served three terms in the United States Senate in Florida it's going to be fascinating to see how this Kevin nothing plays out here\nWhat I'm looking at not had a bunch of people asked me this during the course of the way could I don't know the answer yet I'm Still trying to figure this out is this an inflection point in American history everything we're going through right now\nSo I Do these weekly series for my local shows and it's all about where we are politically based upon historical analysis\nAnd for the midterm elections I'll give you the Reader's Digest version we tend to be incredibly incredibly predictable in terms of political swings in this country the issues change the politician strange times change\nBut we had been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk you back real quick to the president's election twenty six same\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable and twenty six team when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and the way I was able to do it just based upon historical trends simply put you take a look at history back in a twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president\nThere has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats to see to date full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office yes he later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent in all during the primary process especially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running isn't Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can't be good this and that ... vote for the person you believe in\nBecause the odds are the Republican candidate what when\nAnd sure enough there you go now in the context in mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent president's party loses generally in fact there was only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifties\nThan the incumbent presidents party has actually gained seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point\nAmerican history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had\nThe bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nFunction point American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush in the wake of nine eleven so it took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate map favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was likely to be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten point to what the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this\nAgain when I've been taking a look at for ... and how much this vote meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump broke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to stay but still the house you can take awhile again if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pace in somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which would be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that\nThey just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nMy question is and this is what I'm working on because again I base everything off of information are we at an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this Kavanaugh situation is that an analogous to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot\nThat Great Depression not after nine eleven\nIf you're looking for a ... the absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was in Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton but then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right we've had the ...\nThat's the gauge and we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this\nRight now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent\nIn the first hour I mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and when you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential and this type of an environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and get vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling and the end the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you're in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe Manchin is going to win a hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what

the media sucks in this country All right and uh I don't have to tell you that\nBut it is really easy to information early and empirically tell you who in what John Paul Stevens is because anytime you

like having all through the mud you know he's done so much and it's been a well regarded by many people for Thirty years than who the hell well could they not dragged through the mind\nAnd go and that's what I've been talking about right along in fact when I was last with you\nWe could go to say that was the entire premise of what I was sharing during the course\nOf the show this entire cabinet thing was not about the Supreme Court he was not about ... it was about all of us because if they could take down Brett Kavanaugh with an accusation or accusations without any evidence without any evidence\nAnd we just presume if we don't like you you're guilty or all screwed well screw\nI mean that is the end of the story and so the single most important thing that has happened here is not that Brett Kavanaugh is about to be ... approved for the Supreme Court the United states the single most important thing is that the presumption of guilt wasn't accepted here\nThat was far more important then again it's a razor thin margin were riding on right now we're that\nClose that close to those today to the presumption of guilt being the new way that we do things here in this country\nAnd could you imagine could you imagine how involved and people would be not just towards politicians but again if somebody got sideways with yeah work somebody go sideways with your kids to school I mean that's what's at stake here so much more\nAid spry mud I Am your friend here in South Florida how ya doing morning show in ah West Palm beach W.

Republican gubernatorial candidate and now my buddy from Fox News radio had been brown on the best in the business caught up with a run earlier today and\nAnd suddenly that clip it is [noise] uh about so much more as Ron correctly pointed out\nThere's something else involving Rhonda Santas and this is something that he played out around the state yesterday but it's something that is a bigger issue for everybody for every body marched ad\nJak live in a new book our police\nBeautiful book and it's a illustrated perfect for your kids grandkids our police go ahead and and do the pretty ordering do it on Amazon and if you don't do it by the end of the show I Am bound to activate Alexa and and make a likes to do it for you so our police by Jack London\nWhat's going on with the police in this country and and yeah I Know what happened in Illinois today in in my my dad always said that there\nAre few people worse than a backup but few people you'll ever find that are better than good cops and we have hundreds of thousands of good cops every day that go to work and make it happen and I have to deal\nWith the crap that has thrown their way by our media and by so many that want to use them for political purposes you think about it we can go to work everyday wearing about oh we've got to deal with the boss so we got this meeting those are our big problems\nWhen you're a cop and you put on that bad she can go to work or to their biggest problems we have the luxury of being a man I really don't want to go this meeting today because they put on their badge and they put their lives on the line that is what's on the line here in this country and look at all the attention that a bad cup\nBest convicted gets\nBut what you don't hear about\nFolk fest sacrifice everything there was something that happened here yesterday\nThat criminalizes this perfectly for the entire country now the sunset and I'll give you an idea of just in the grand scheme of awful where they stand\nOne of their ah major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here this is an excerpt from an article yesterday police shooting in endorses Republican Ron does scientist for governor for years after endorsing Democrat\nWrite\nLittle excerpt from the story a major union for police officers but Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor\nCharlie Crist anyways a\nLot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist a literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently who's a Democrat but as a serving out of the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor and and Florida Rubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm\nContinuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the Santa is the PBA president said this Santas\nWould be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for ... ... has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians whichever resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boils boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to this\nPose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for this unsettled he ended the article what this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling not had any mothers that their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I notice what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look and and I was tracking\nViolence towards police officers remember before the whole Kaepernick thing even ... you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them at all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida that tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance\nBut here's what's real in this story\nRemember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nThat's the same was talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's gone on for ever and a seemingly no resolution inside\nBut the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is ever liked refugees and I have long had my focus on refugees for a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees now a lot it\nWas made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\nThe implications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told we as taxpayers pay to bring the refugees into the United states average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies the typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready\nTo hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe so if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate primarily sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states and by the way Ninety One percent of refugees\nWe bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that weren't skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire we said no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggests that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost\nTo import people in ... competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nIf you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society\nYou give them the opportunity\nThan for Donald Trump has been doing\nHis policy\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise]\nTwo sides to stories one side

why don't you let everyone know what the checkpoint has in store here a ... and briefly XP has in store here\nAre coming up in a in the immediate future\nHow we are just thrilled to be part of this new venture for us and we want to bring your viewers year let's nursed a more engaging content and that that's what we have to provide\nAnd that's usually the the biggest thing is anytime a the phrase under new management approaches ... especially you know in in our world everyone goes oh no the thing that I Love it's about to disappear and go away and and I think that's kind of been the biggest thing process it it it's not it's not about the spirit go away it's there is about to be more of that that you\nLove exactly it's about to change right ... ... a checkpoint radio is becoming checkpoint media with beings we XP and what that means for you guys fans of the show\nIs that you're going to get a lot more of what you already love where you're already a law that we're going to be looking at adding more to which\nWe're going to be looking to add more in terms of our podcast content we're really going to be looking to ramp up everything that you love about checkpoint and that's what you guys are providing us the ability and and the opportunity to do so thank you so much Carolyn appreciate it so much here at checkpoints so\nWhat was the major factor a ... decision to get into you sports\nYeah oh it's providing different content and we want to have more access to gang fees and millennials ended says the pathway we are we think it's great and that's I think on the moon and the average us really excited to be part of it and\nWho would I think is so exciting you know I I've actually had the pleasure of working a day job at ... for the last three years and and still they still do and here's the thing is that I\nHave is so enjoyed my time with the company and what I've learned is that there is a really\nBig willingness to embrace new innovative things right\nI've found that you know and I've worked in broadcasting for now Fifteen Years that feels ... per se but that Beasley is uniquely suited for those that are looking to do something innovative with with media\nYeah tell animation as one of our core values and we'd like to say within our company you either an advocate or die\nOf course that's not an option right now not so we're always looking for new exciting thing will offer tales our viewers and our listeners\nNate unlike you I have not had the pleasure of working in a day job a piece for the past three years I have been a in the retail sector for the last twelve years of my life I'd like to first of all to send a thank you for allowing me to escape from that one of the things that I I Know our audience is going to be curious to know about one of the things that we see all the time\nAs gamers as when ever any kind of traditional media tries to make headway into gaming it always feels very patronizing it always feels very like oh it's a side show\nThat has not been our experience one bit with a ... like he just give us a little bit about easily mindset on the world of sports gaming\nYes how are pointing at the L and that you are the experts here right and you have built that's what it has said why go and and change anything right we just want to help you grow up and I get every source has to offer more contact care who you are and\nIt is it really does facilitate the ability for us to you know concentrate more on the content that we've been working to bring to the channel and to the radio show and you know with access to those types of resources\nUm you know what we what we've been doing I think fairly well all ready is really just going to be able to be taken to the next level\nAnd I think that that's that's something that's so critical and so important about bees we and and the acquisition of a checkpoint I think that that's going to be so important in a ... in allowing us to really dig in to the east sports culture to the video game culture\nAnd ... and really start to make an indelible mark here\nAnd that's what we hope to bring to the table for you guys you know we we really want to do well\nI'm you know putting the best face in the best foot forward on on being you know traditional media's in to any sports and the video game world and and I think that you know I really have to commend you guys\nAre for doing research on on you know who would be the most authentic to bring that to a to an audience and flattered that you came up with us now\nHere let me just give kudos to you guys and the others on fact and destroy right I mean think about like you all have accomplished over the last couple of years right I mean you're\nOn over the radio station and if you laugh and then candidate I reach over ... million listeners on a weekly basis is still baffling to hear that number yeah and he's done that without a lot of [noise]\nYou know resources behind you had that just speaks to the content that you guys are generated ...\nThank you for that I that you're right if this has been a frankly are our passion project now for about two and a half years ah there's been\nA we've done it for pretty much products now or do we have here and you know there's so many people have gone into to making this happen you know not least of which Rick Scott our producer who's been with us into the beginning our families who have been\nAt times unreasonably supportive of us are more than any family could ever be asked to be and it is amazing that we get to it's kind of spearhead this movement into to ease words for Beasley I and I think one of the the key things to this\nIs the acknowledgement by ... uh you know a group at a traditionally very steeped in radio\nSort of knowledge that Internet is is is coming up it is it is going to be a major forefront of the next kind of a generation of media consumption what what for you what is ... approach to the Internet as a whole to the Internet world\nWe just hear that as another platform right we want to distribute our content across multiple platforms we are and content company hero and we want to engage our listeners are yourself that's the way we deal at\nWhat I Love about that is is the way you say that was so matter of fact the ... of course the Internet is just another platform and yet when in our early days of trying to get the show around\nIt's really kind of dealt with the fundamental problem of ... in the early going of Fortnite competitive it was all about who won the game that let everyone playing very defensively very safely and it wasn't that exciting to watch but now they've found new kind of format that encourage players to get out there be aggressive you know what I might not win the game but if I can win ten thousand dollars right now ... killed I might be a much more aggressive\nDo know and and you may not and uh and and forgive me if you don't but you know if uh you know what the rules were for this particular area but it was similar to last week's\nWhere you could earn a an additional points not only by getting the victory route going all the way you could also earned more points if you got a certain number killed again trying to encourage players not to just find the hiding spot and wait till the circle closes and\nYeah that makes sense do you think that this is what the sport and I've seen is going to keep doing is of falls in the way that their tournaments work or do you think that they're going to finally find a format and subtle on it I think\nYou know they'll do this for about a year and then they'll look back and see which ones got the best reaction and they'll pick one of those to go forward and there'll be the you know the accepted format for Fortnite interesting\nThe winds keep on coming for astrologers fresh off when at the London based that major this time they took home the gold at the blast pro series ... to do so they breeze through the competition without losing a single map even in the finals M. I. B. R. couldn't slow down at straws and they went on to win the lion share of the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar prize\nThat is really impressive is Raul is has been having a very dominant year this year I think they're up to like fourteen tournament wins or something ridiculous this year they've just been having an unbelievable year ... us but yeah I was gonna say especially for see us go this year has been very very strong for a strong with\nWhich is great for them I think that that's phenomenal so congratulations to withdraw is\nThe city of kind of Ysaye has voted to spend roughly three point five million dollars promoting their into extreme masters events through the next five years originally the partnership between ESL and kind of say we're set to expire and twenty Nineteen but that deal will not run through twenty twenty three how to be set to become the fourteenth counter strike global offensive major next year\nNow this is really interesting because ... has of course become one of the biggest tournaments in a young stable and hardest pronounced debate yes exactly that's of course how uh how we you know they got on our radar\nUm but anyway no I I I think that this is a a a phenomenal up pairing us to know that it's going to continue to run for twenty twenty three\nFour and also an ESL hasn't actually had a ... major now since ah ESL one cologne and that was in twenty sixteen so they he has done without you know real heavy involvement with a valve major for some time now so it's good to see them getting back into that and especially with kind of say which has become one of our favorite tournaments outta here lately absolutely it's always fun to watch this one is for you\nThe Russian conglomerate that owns s K gaming and British pro is making a move to reach younger audiences they've partnered with KFC present KFC battle a large scale educational sport and cultural event it will be sure I Do too championship and winners of the event who interrupts around Europe\nOh my okay well ... ... so we're talking about Kentucky Fried chicken KFC route I go by that any more but yes hello ... right yeah\nThat was correct so I'm just kind of curious when we're going to start seeing you know like a hundred year old gold barbecue brain it's it's if it next year it yeah it absolutely the better we're always talking about how good it is to see you know you're not endemic sponsors starting to move in\nCamps is an interesting one can see is definitely an interesting one and here's the thing is ... and and I know that I'm teasing them for you know some of their uh sponsorship for war a wrestling but the thing is is that they have shown\nActually through their sponsorship of wrestling how much they get it\nAre members of match where they actually had the colonel I remember I remember that yeah so I mean could it could we actually see maybe the colonel sit down and take down somebody in star craft\nTo well I think Jason Alexander is playing right now I Would certainly be in to see that would be aware of that would be great that's off the checkpoint each sports update for more at on over to our website checkpoint radio dot\nCom thanks jokes for the update when talking about traditional sports moving into each sport it's usually the NBA or the NFL there were referring to however this week the players association for major league baseball made made a major announcement as it pertains to each sport\nYes a major league baseball players association is teaming up with you I'm Jim media to present a new each sport series and it's not any one game it's a series of each sports are starting with sport night as it's obviously the most visible\nHold on yes okay you said starting with for it not correct I would've I would've naturally considered that this would have been you know like ... will be the show or you know any number of baseball games that exist out\nThere and you know what I thought about that but then I remember back to when we reported last year\nA major league baseball was making was taking a look at any sport scene and we'll lambasted them for that\nLittle everything needs to be an ... and and you're absolutely right but I think that this actually brings into focus one of that one of the key points in that discussion your right not everything needs to be an easy sport\nBut there is a lot of room for involvement in a variety of ways with sports I think that this is incredibly smart on M. obese part\nBecause they know maybe they're video game not the most engaging not the most entertaining for audiences to watch but getting in on on other games I think that's really smart\nWell I think major league baseball more than any of the traditional sports has\nTo find a way to start connecting with that younger audience again their audience has aged into the sixties or so that it it it in their in their kind of a dangerous by young people are not watching baseball but if they can get you know people interested in their talent and that's what's so interesting about this east part series is that it's not\nRegular people coming in and playing its MLD players past and present\nWay what it is okay we're okay we're talking about a tournament yes all ... of an OB player yes now the season is over you know I remember I was moving into postseason baseball but right of go into the winter weather is no baseball but instead of playing anything related to ...\nThey were playing Fortnite but they're starting with war and they're going to play a bunch of different sports yes\nI Love this I think it's brilliant I Love this remember when we were when we were talking about the idea of like a celebrity tournament young how well that would go for about ... or when which saw you know Shaquille O'Neal playing fighting game\nRight it feels like this like this this feels like this would be exactly appropriate and and that's really\nThe goal I think is to try and engage the younger audience and really start promoting the personality that we get because I mean in all the the major sport it really seems like\nBaseball has a difficult time promoting their personalities I mean you look at something like the MBA and there's been waves made about a Jimmy Butler he wants he he's\nDemanding a trade every every station is covering that and ... in the grand scheme of things who's Jimmy Butler and why does anyone carries right I mean timber wolves on whatever it's not a not a huge team why does that matter and yet the same time you got all this drama happening around the end\nOf this of the regular season with a team's chasing down wild card spots and whatnot baseball and no one's covering that baseball has an image problem yeah but if they can start capitalizing on some of the\nAnd each sports is such a prime way to do that not only capitalize on their current players but they can also now take you know those big names that we remember from the nineties people like that too can come back and even compete in these sports event it's brilliant on their part you\nKnow and I think that there is a multigenerational aspect to ease words\nAnd just the video games overall that's a lot of times overlooked right and and that is just the simple fact that sometimes getting someone who is a fish out of water to play with someone who knows very well can be very
