they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair biased coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people are seeing her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless\nLay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempt to do it ... and the character in

day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity\nYou might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there's going to be a paddle on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox\nIn a call

M. W. about it so [noise] I'm Dave Ramsey or host the show America\nThank you for joining us if you show because\nIt's all about ... opens owns a triple a eight to five five to to buy a triple A. [noise] eight to five five two to five\nTrevor is with us in Greensboro North Carolina Hi Trevor how are you\nI'm doing great Dave thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nA well me and my wife were working on the debt snowball I'm In July I got laid off\nA kind of a blessing in disguise I Am working again\nI'm making less money but a lot less stress and so what is your input on a plan that we had to sell our house who to pay off all of our debt and and kick start us going in and being kind of start over\nHow much debt do you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand [laughter] and so on your home will clear that yes and then somebody would a much more would you put in your pocket past that\nAre probably about twenty five plus thousand math or you know we'll defeated everything\nOkay and so um what's your household income today\nAbout eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\nWe're not in love with it or we bought at four and a half years ago um 'cause we want it to chase somebody else's dream and then we're realizing it's not our dream and it was either a mortgage racing\nJust deciding oh I Love her out of this man you know I'm so we we don't we're not ... uh and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan with we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy a smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm so I [noise] um\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of this equation um but I Will be a straight with you I I'm afraid I'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that is not a script I Want to join in on\nA you can be happy and make more money and this idea that in order for your life to be good you have to take a dumbed down job and you're not living to your potential and I'm not suggesting you'd go back into a high stress situation\nBut uh doing something you love you could make double what you're making now and it feels a little bit like your surrendering settling\nDropping down into something I don't know if I'm hearing that but I'm afraid I'm hearing that\nWell actually long term goal I Do want to own my own business um this week to get me back working and to have an income um we we were already planning you know long term things and we knew that getting out of debt which are way to get\nTo where we want it to be I don't feel yeah I I Want to make more money okay right now it it it facilitates me working and working on our future plans\nOkay All right I'm ... and so this this um moved down in house you're moving more than half of the house\nUh it sounds like a multi ... even if you rent for six months or something you know I moved back in this price range or you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense um and so this move down to half of the house has probably three to five year plan\nCorrect okay\nAll right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nAbout angry because that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in sphere so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this is a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable
