talking about third down the inefficiencies tonight Scott and be a better way to put it right or to Lebanon third downs tonight no no\nNo not enough and and you know we throw on some families with different things and you get a defense off the field and they come back out after the they just ran out of gas just the inability to sustain a drive in where their defense down a little bit um and it does happen especially young guys that were starting for the first hour plane significant steps for the first time\nNot only physically but mentally you start getting worn down and um I thought they held up pretty decent the first half a second half you could just see Michigan really take control the game and we just didn't have a PR after that\nAs you might imagine we've had plenty of bees in the box tonight at ... dot com this one the subject line says why\nOr why not pull your quarterback and give it another quarterback a prospect to chance you\nKnow a lot of different things go into that depends on your philosophy the coaching staff I I think a lot of times things are going bad you're trying to get the some momentum out of this game in the next week um but it's not like high school ... you're not looking at doing that kind of stuff is is what these guys come here to do when you were under starting spot and\nUh it's it's not equal playing time it's not that kind of stuff in 'em at different times we've seen Paul do that where he has put it in different quarterbacks at at the towards the tail to games more so when we're winning and you want to make sure you don't set them up for failure you want to give them best opportunity to give it a shot and\nAnd if they're not ready to go they're not going to put you in there so those guys need to continue to develop you never know when your number's going to be called a with without going down if if he were to get hurt by chance and uh she got to prepare like you you will be in there um but if they're not ready to go

Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on that\nYeah we needed to show a pattern here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your or high\nThey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best that and podcast\nOr should have the ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left is embarrassing barbarism again\nJust wanting to get your thoughts are ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more thing that\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNone of what they want not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats weren't a Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\n[laughter] well I'm the Democrats at at that time there they seek a issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou were what purpose\nMy ... the Democratic party hasn't changed that\nMuch as my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in the anti capitalism\nHas been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on the militants and violent socialism to

or is that a pension\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or ... okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYup okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct okay I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're ... those guys [laughter] oh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we count as before then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got in that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some odd but I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers was put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only are celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nThat that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\n...

process either as a um health and fitness\nCoach okay very good and what kind of debt was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off in the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right I'm going out and we decided to baton for ... to yeah emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we didn't brand new\nAnd it was the end where just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future [laughter] so we just we went ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you get into where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lotta time on the road and always listen to and I said we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time I always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ... racing center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of we started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWhile well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from ... to maintain it because I Believe in modeling all the various ... if I'm gonna model what I wanted my children and having a future had model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened much happened on this show any rich [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on 'cause they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief housing kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be dead for each one of the things you need to do if you want to\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor or what subject do you teach\nTheology and specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have disabilities cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out off the couch and exercise are being physically active now more towards the competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand a hand in glove with some therapy people in the therapy community a would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nOr in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students but you're using your research in your expertise in your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you Dave how're you doing today\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year a completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nBut [laughter] driving the base but whatever [laughter] I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as you also there struck me told me about sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk\nAnyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a\nTruck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home mhm um and my uncle is willing to buy your labor for me for free or to get it fixed up putting new engine it when you training and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck\nA problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it's really not going to be reliable as a a moderate are what the law which rod would you consider going down the road and you know about that a couple of thousand into this truck to make it you know what you know driving around\nOr do you you know save up and wait for a year later on\nI think the trucks at keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous is going to be hated to I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty vet does rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ...\nTo four but dual for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent on the truck motor and that kinda stuff\nAnd move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a ... D move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do with the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\nI'm good how are you do better than I deserve\nWhat's up\n[laughter] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for some advice um my wife and I and there have been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt as in about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while\nAnd we are required basically it's you know pay for some of those business expenses during the trip that money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to fee pays for that but we have to kind of want that money ahead of time um [noise]\nWe close out all of our credit cards\nExcept for the one of these business trips because we don't have money you know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but I mean every time I go on a business trip it's get anywhere from a thousand three thousand dollars covering the hotel\nOr a guy who was and then you get it and get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying ... pain that often and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use it in\nThe ... losing the you need to see that one time you need to ... from the ... one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you\nBack a little company you're taking a big risk ... years or\nYou're the bank or for the small company that's too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some point\nThey may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so ... so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company goes ... they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold some day\nSure I've seen it happen I've been doing is Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOf ... so then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I wanted to do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk I Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that\nI don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollar right\nI don't ask my people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their ally grown and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on their eye on them you know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and\nAsked them to pay for me to pay back [noise] we just pay for and we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're companies should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card and do away with a credit card\nGonna make yet how ... going to make your stomach\nBecause now you're realizing there's a real\nRisk area this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on ...\nOkay and you're for paid for rentals and they have this one okay yeah um how quickly couldn't you part of this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI rarely moved into it [laughter] any here which every three\nYeah I Would think you could you know that sounds right\nAnd then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television and sit down at the kitchen table tonight look at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people\nPour it all on to this rental for two years is this rental worth that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or you know or do we want to sell it but I don't want to know but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nAnd then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rentals if the best way to do it is to live debt free than Ashley live debt free yeah stop it and\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah\nSo um you know decide because I think you are really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrowed money for rental and then you kind of like lost your mind for a minute\nOr\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much\nI you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by the ready to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others\nThat's what I Would do so hey thanks for calling in sounds like you guys got a lot going on I mean you're making good money you get your school stuff you can do here that's very cool thank you for joining us Joshua is with us in Chattanooga Hi Joshua how are you\nHey Dave I'm Glad to be

when she got how much cash if we got\n... thirty thousand dollars cash and I'm Alone that do you have I have thirty two thousand and what's your household income right now my wife and I can bond bringing home about six thousand Amal okay\nNo I mean I wouldn't sell this car you know the cars out not out of line it's it's a it's a Seventeen thousand dollar sale to solve a two thousand dollar

eight hundred grand okay [laughter] my goodness gracious ... so what in the world this was a bizarre bizarre numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have\nThe new everything and the nice everything luckily for us plus for us that we had a decent income to what you do for a live with all that well I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd Tiffany\nI stay home with these two little lady cost some ... okay\nAn auto um\nYeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I I listen to your show probably for about eight months leading up to this and you know for me it was pride and ego just\nYou know I'm too sophisticated for that that's best for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold\nA a lake house we saw what a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but we made it through and knocked it out and so excited\nGoodness gracious [noise] so I don't er thousand as your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nYou know obviously ... Wheldon so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the lake house bring the bishops brings\nSo the the uh the net off the lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\n... with a net I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the four Seventy in order to reduce\nThe other ... the cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we heard about a hundred and twenty less than that\nAnd that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off for assure okay sure so the ... a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this year I was done with the sale of these two properties oh yeah okay yeah wow\nYeah All right and all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge to an advisory or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to the lake and how and mark caught me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one interest worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go she'll radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity is all a lifespan and I think\nYou know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time and then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were at the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and he wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... date or on board from the beginning I mean I'm\n... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\nAnyone what's your word it was really difficult to to give out some things that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that but it also kind of oil down here they are getting older and we have you know\nKnow I just wanted to go and do I want to pay for it I'm like I knew I go to a private pilot and I found it on\nMonday good at going back to the fact that it's premium off but it doesn't cost me anything and I'm gonna have to pay you know I'm sure it has a cash value in it right\nDown to three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums\nIraq\nNow that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nTo act like I said it's not all ... they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nBut they're taking ... and\nYou know it's hot Sony is my point he made it sound like it's three\nRight which I went back to ... you know policy that rates are low\nAnd I know and when you die you know what happens to the rebels in dollars they're going to keep it now\nI don't keep it so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles Hey Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous they thank you for taking my call sure what's up so um\nMy question revolves the twenty five percent rule that you use for the home mortgage my wife my bottom home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include the property taxes all minorities association and be insurance as part of the main thing I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H o lay\nThe property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way they teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that has one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from\nBeing house you pour okay where they got a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers like we we actually did a thirty year long but at the council twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinanced into a Fifteen year low one that\nYou can ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen and they will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape right now you gotta clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand dollar\nIncome take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know Hitler the whole the whole point is big\nNumbers here not the new show and not splitting hairs on it the er and honestly and you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be house you pour that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off for like ... I Am twenty seven years old I had a and a total of twenty five hundred that are twenty five thousand a day or that including my mortgage and and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house or to save up and buy and so at least\nSave up for the down or if it would be more ideal per se but\nJust continue continue continue ... every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you right now in ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up and how you\nKnow add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical neither based\nIn what I what I what House that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would why spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an expert brown jak kids I work with children right that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nThey sell for about an between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street ...\nPretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and then my ... my part is a\nLittle microphone is somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street right but you wouldn't want you wouldn't come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it cause Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYou know in your mortgage in all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and where you are and how much of that is mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAh there is only three thousand in the day and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nAnd you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't do math myself by and I know that we plan on eliminating the access that within the next night yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying the falling out twice and an extra fall now between the lowest in my\nFamily actually so my eggs if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you paid cash for the addition is that okay\n\nUm well I mean that's where I'm kind of ... I just I Want to do with that\nNow that's under such a simple question if it takes two years from today and you are dead free it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay\nPlan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I live\nGood parenting you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand [laughter] and you paid off\nEverything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so\nI think you've got a great plan I Would become debt free and then I Would save up an add on to my house so more than twenty thousand make sure you get contractor ... and everything down so you know what you're getting into\nThis hour of the day Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember there's really only one way to financial peace in the daily\nPrince of these crises\nYou would be a renter was an option to purchase the house for the loan balance for a number of years until you get your other debts paid off now much of the dead of you got\nIt got fifty four thousand left on their own\nOkay right\nOkay so she moves out you move in and around that you sell your house oh how much where you're much equity we get out of your house\nMay be down and not very much at all\nOkay so excel or at the baby ... baby step to a little bit ... the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is on the loan\nShe writes refinanced about I'm ... years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nYou know it's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to show me you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund done and baby step three but it's going to get a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year or more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it uh just because of emotions but this is not a bad thing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting it your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it\nAnd so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you will have to move\nBecause if you say no now she needs to just sell the house right correct okay so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract we obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to win it for the payment and we want a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nIn and give them a by going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this equity given to you\nKnow you sure\nAs far as I understand it around\nThere yeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pollen talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance\n\nLease it for the payment with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just show it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nDoesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe I'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay\nPersonal finances personal and that doesn't mean situation only ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item\nYou know that a car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not selling that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway about three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I was about the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference and the both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur\nBut we're going to factor in you know that there's something real uh about the connectivity till the item and its reason reasonable people would acknowledge that can activity you cannot do personal finance for that at all so being person\nThat's why people don't get out of it we don't get mad enough and you gotta get mad [noise] getting mad person was like I'm sick and tired of being sort of there are we make so much money how stupid or we were about to change our lives now see that's partially\nRetro real stuff\nIt is today Ramsey show\nAll it takes is one emergency trip to the dentist to blow your budget quickly now I'm
