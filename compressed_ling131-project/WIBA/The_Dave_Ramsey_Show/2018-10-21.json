us to be aware of how you do so I'm forty six thirty six as well All right and they'll pay for a lot in the new\n\nLaw but it's good way to go to answer for a while we do\n[laughter]\n[laughter] well good job you guys will just hours worth I'm ... now it's probably for twenty yeah wow Peretti may\nYeah the market has gone crazy in Phoenix and we were so fortunate because when we moved there was a very low the market and and we didn't have any debt so we could afford that was the only you know debt that we had we bought a house and then we paid it off I don't know\nIt was incredible journey it took full two years to pay it off and that was our gazelle intense so it was um it was hard it was hard um I Would just want to say what you do makes a different all through your marriage like we've grown so much\nAs a couple of going through this process this is not just to get out of debt show it's not just money it's your whole life if your marriage you know so I I just wanted to mention that I mean it's been a fantastic journey credible I'm so proud of you who are your biggest cheerleaders yeah so my dad was a huge cheer leader average\nSay my older brother damn yeah a couple of family members on the good side yeah not on the dark so before shelter I [laughter] love us right way to go you're ... yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off our house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey had come home from work one day and he just said hey I heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finance and he said chicken look at the sky and see what you think\nSo the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came from that you had created I'll listen to those CDs and literally that day my life what from awesome\nThat we had everything we could ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and boat it was awesome until it was an awesome because we didn't own anything ... nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own anything and so that started the journey so lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before we finally settled in Cape creek Arizona\nAir got hurt on a construction job he was builder um and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college you said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cashed bloated yeah and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the house off in two years and I said you're crazy yeah [laughter] but\nI really thought we could but this last two years has sucked\nIt was hardly at all you so you do the three Ninety four really in two years or how much are the three Ninety four was the house was two hundred and forty thousand okay who you're already in two years\nYeah whoa that was the gazelle intense where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans\nYeah yeah he cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah so then when you look down and go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with wild good that's\nRight because he had graduated from college and got a good job I had my good job we were stable ready to go\nAnd we did it I Love it alone [laughter] well I'm spoiled and we did it so Eric what kind of injury did you have\nYou're making a little profit you may get a lot\nNow it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not\nAnd all that and that's you know in our ... know that your gross ...\nThat's before you count like antsy and major repairs that come up so that's the gross cash flow the difference in the ... the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut you know you yeah fire five ... five grand for around something like that I'm On a year from like the overall I Am right I mean some years will be better than others and that kind of on a bunch of rental property shark and trying to do these things are my Dutch\nUm the uh uh in what your household income\n[noise] um we bring about a hundred and ten gross to tell you what do you own your home our primary [laughter] ah we just heard to stay\nOn ten months ago we owe to eighty and worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and ... and show he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you had a hundred and eighty official both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion I'm All right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on his break down and we have about ten thousand dollars a year and a and got together and and your ... uh we have a combined probably twelve thousand 'cause we took him we had a lot but we took a bite out of debt so\nWe have any help now than ours like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you go through your plan okay if you're going to be my plan you'd write a check today and be done for it\n[noise] yeah the only reason I was headed to end the call now because you're doing ... and ... you\nKnow at the end of the year I'm always really tough and I feel you know environment\nSo it was just there in the event that on my condition it don't come through for the next three nights I'm afraid liquidated Atlantic I don't know anything an actor in life being a hot spot so I figure congressman and everything that ball then I Would try to track\nMhm ... ... ... or any of the\nUh uh you know ... ... you're not\nMaking a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compost\nMiles between the two of you I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate [noise] and I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep 'em in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that and that you're in a gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the end of your lose money on that house if you're in a three month vacancy if the markets off about ... you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically forty so I'm probably dump on the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following them through in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility that's separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd build your some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that and that's that's the cycle you're trying to break some good question

car in here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I'd say no you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollars a pack of fifty eight hundred dollars\nFor a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right now I Can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the time she forgot how to get home that's what side of that\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes definitely she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee from\nWisconsin\nAnd we'd have one of those silver alert or whatever they call them right yeah yeah no I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right\nBut you have to do your job has the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care yeah it's very hard\nFor you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOK\nSo all the student loan people they get zip nothing nada\nOkay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip\nSell the car now I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension\nAnnuity for security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom was that was in the evening\nI paid fifty on that last month on each one\nAnd it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks shuttles a whole dead or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get\nNothing\n'cause she you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attachment annuity\nAnd so\nThat she is what we called judgment proof because she's\nBroke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets in her only income as pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that from your Comedy Central coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here yeah I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nIn the last thing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rent and she is taking care of only then do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gifts nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like 'cause\nI Want you to get a little that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you\nYeah but you got to be our cars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you\nCan do it you can do it if you need some
