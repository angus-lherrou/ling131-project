talk recruiting every week\nWith Jesse temple of the athletic the athletic dot com and Jessie let's today talking about a couple of athletes the badgers\nHave committed for twenty Nineteen I'm not sure what the physicians will be maybe you can fill us in on that but one of them is from tiny grants Burke, Wisconsin he's the second rank recruiting the state according to twenty four seven sports Leo Chanel I Know Iowa and Minnesota wanted him to so where do you see Leo Chanel fitting in Wisconsin\nWell right now the plan is earlier to play inside linebacker and he's been dominant at the high school level for grants or he he not only plays linebacker this season but he's also running back following\nA in the footsteps of his older brother John who was a record setting running back there and it's now a walk on full back for the ... when I talked to Leo after he committed last fall a it's still felt like a dream to him because he said\nIn his brothers would always talk about crazy things like playing for the badgers and they would play the NCA football video came on X. box and they be Wisconsin and and envision themselves there\nAnd now it's really going to happen and it was such a talented athlete that as a running back he's got seven hundred sixty three yards rushing but as a linebacker he had a Twenty one tackle game and the season opener against a word so he's all over the field a and certainly a tremendous athlete that I Know people across the state will be looking forward to watching mattress uniform\nYou know you mentioned ... brother is older brother is John he's a freshman listed as a fall back on the badgers roster do you see John maybe feeling that role at some point in his career I Know he hasn't seen the field yet\nEither you certainly capable of it um you know and that's what a standout running back he was in Wisconsin tends to find guys are that are willing to do the dirty work at full back and you you can see Alex singled was\nGator a player of the year quarterback willing to do the dirty work now contributing in a major ... certainly I can see John feeling that roll uh a couple of years down the road in maybe a split capacity with somebody else\nOkay another athlete the batteries are bringing in and twenty Nineteen eighties mark is Graham from mount Holly North Carolina to get to recruit from North Carolina we've seen a few more of those over the past few years haven't we\nWe've had Wisconsin's done an excellent job going down south a ... and getting players are and as you mentioned Marcus Gramm another one\nOut of North Carolina I'm you know this year he's actually he suffered an ACL injury early in the season though he he's out for the rest of the seas meant certainly hope that he's able to recover a and B as best when he does get to Wisconsin but right now uh Wisconsin is looking at him potentially a wide receiver you mentioned that he's recruited at an athlete he was a quarterback\nLast season as a junior for mount Holly in a really good one each roofer twelve hundred Seventy yards with sixteen touchdowns in one interception well he also ran for eight hundred and fifty eight years with Fifteen touchdown and caught a few passes so when I talked to a school coach Robert Washington senior over a mountain island he said that this kid has unreal\nTalent from just pure athletic ability any kind of flew under the radar and recruiting early because he wanted to be a quarterback and\nJust the way it's body type is in his skills that he really didn't project that way at the high ... level and so it was constant obviously saw something in him and the other thing about them is\nYou know he could potentially play quarterback in Wisconsin wanted to go that route but again I Do think that they're going to happen that wide receiver right now he's the only receiver a in that twenty Nineteen recruiting class trip\nAs I mentioned Wisconsin in Nebraska tonight Nebraska when Nineteen Nineteen in three years under Mike Riley then fired him\nAnd hired Scott draws to quarterback the Nineteen Ninety seven undefeated hosts cruise to his share of the national championship and Jesse back in July a big tent media days frost was asked about Wisconsin in the fact that since joining the Big Ten Nebraska's one in six against the ...\nThe guy in a lot of what a Wisconsin doing his is doing is the Nebraska model [noise]\nThey've been out in Nebraska in Nebraska\nWe're here to fix that Scott Frost is a good quote and he's a good coach too it's only a matter of time before he turns that ... program around don't you think\nI Would have to think though but I wrote about this earlier this week just what an interesting\nDynamic it is between two press conferences held four hundred eighty two miles apart on Monday when I offer is that Wisconsin and Scott Ross and Nebraska you know the toughest question or one of the toughest questions all that was about whether its players needed a reminder that Nebraska used to be good enough to compete for national championships and Scott Ross is just being hammered question that the filled\nWith doom and gloom because the teams on for for the first time in Seventy three years so he would that that a little bit about that quote not to specifically but\nUh he was asked whether Wisconsin essentially was now what Nebraska used to be and he he really didn't give a specific answer on that one other than that paused and a great job but it's it's just interesting the way things have happened and I don't think anybody envisioned when the brass joined a big tent at the courthouse just would be in this position\nYou know they've been out scored on average thirty nine to Twenty one season badgers in Cornell's coming up and just a bit hey if

Martinez can purchase on the ground that's pretty good our us tough to bring down so again I I I think you can be fair to Nebraska they have a lot of skill and and I support that by having talked to someone Wisconsin Steve ... says swing and said yeah this is\nBy far the best skill position team we played thus far no defensively they've had a lot of issues on their secondary\nWhich has led to a lot of breakdowns bad tackling NGOs and they're going to transition ... never easy for us to our players this way a couple of transfers Greg bell started the season that's the number one tale back junior college transfer he's going to transfer and really highly touted wide receiver ties on women say he's going to transfer\nWe're going to say more and more of this as a here's move on that for game limit yeah where are you got four games to play and then you can live ... miles around the country getting out of the quarterback of some fame right after the ... and the left that team and feeling\nSad about his lack of team spirit\nSo I mean they got a culture change going on on that side line them you know we're celebrating culture change Wisconsin twenty five years ago in the fourth year ... tenure Wisconsin there was a culture change going on and Scott Ross is fighting to make that called change happen to go back to the glory days in Nebraska\nSay Irish guy process he has been
