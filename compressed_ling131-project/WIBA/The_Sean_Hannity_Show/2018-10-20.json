world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha make Sally\nIs that fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nUh well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus\nOf you know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better at ... in a\nIn the polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the ... the Democrat opportunities to go to the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're\nThey're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think we're America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite showing I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those I've been hearing about it from my perspective in the last\nWeek I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty six team\nSo if you can get sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired particularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot of gaining Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have a winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\n\n\n... you were NBC Sports radio lifting now\nFor gay sex I've Jeff pigs if\nLast night was the big night for the red Sox will host came one
