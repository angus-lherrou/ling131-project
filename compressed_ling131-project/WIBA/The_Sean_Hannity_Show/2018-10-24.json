and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and others\nUm how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported in a billionaire left this point\nThe list of George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an electrician and Thirteen Days and on almost\n... you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of these senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the\nTable to bang on the table and then ...\nRips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where\nPeople are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not\nGoing to end well somebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and chapel claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters and ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in Westchester New York suspicious package sent the

we pick up\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watch it had happened to all these Republicans does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the

anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen it'd be go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nBut it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with report suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters\nWere actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites

rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nAbout left or right when when we found out that the that skill leases shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say say I blame burning I just I did the opposite I don't know\nTrouble horrible and somehow we got no liberal media coverage\nYou know I look at it it's not about the coverage because you know but look we just had three weeks ago three weeks ago we had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I've been consistent I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just

bamboozled the people in the states I'm you know it's a one of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have\nThese the what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing a van at the White House\nAnd he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that it does happen to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump in Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMay have been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD their their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incidents so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest that absolute priority\nSo the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we'll spare no resources or experience in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and\nNews for over a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio that I mean this this rush to joke we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBeing dropped out the White House has gotten to the point that the president and will be there and I'm sure he'll talk about the U.S during our borders at that rally as well\nLet me let me just ask is it does it team um I I mean I assume President Trump is not a frivolous guy but he is coming to Wisconsin because Wisconsin is competitive that it is not what the national polling suggesting that um that you know Wisconsin's a lost cause at Wisconsin is in fact the Senate race in the governor's race\nIs competitive and his appearance here to rally up central Wisconsin I'm is something that is worth his time\nIgnore the problem and he told me I ignored and during my race uh everybody you're banned in public opinion polls and gee we won by three point four steps you know ... this race is dead even we need to understand\nMe to understand it every Republican every concerted we've got to get out and vote if there's a huge difference between the parties we were talking about a lot of them but if they are without democratic over the house don't be governing it'll be investigation an impeachment\nThey are going to set it we will not have another judge confirmed for

advantage on early voting turnout um but that is something that could be swamped\nIf the Democrats are actually able to for instance used this story today to try to drive up\nAnger hate and more

Fox News the highest priority for the FBI that's what director Christopher Wray is saying about the theory the homemade bombs that were sent the high profile Democrats including former Presidents Clinton and Obama\nIf these mobs don't stop what they're doing now the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama in the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some advice about putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nMy oven on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost I you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of these senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this was a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nId they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off taught some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then just rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder\nIn his office window and I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist it you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national\nList and his policies\nOf the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home in chapter ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package sent the Debbie Wasserman Schultz is officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou\nKnow with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nWatching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend the entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nWas it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with report suspicious packages and you know that was sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve ... nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such error was it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that still leaves the shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting lead partisan\nIt just they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News

it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have these the what looks like suspicious\nPackages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this is going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing a van at the White House\nAnd uh he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that it does happen to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just writes letters were sent to Trump in Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt the old Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot as we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMay have been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD their their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incidents so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nAfter the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority\nSo the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we'll spare no resources or expanse in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his state\nSpent condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root\nOf all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a\nDecade when he just said Fox News

Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been tone deaf in silent to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nThis is a very very dangerous
