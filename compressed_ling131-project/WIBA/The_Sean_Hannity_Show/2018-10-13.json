Republicans\nAt thirty two I Am putting up on the screen every night on Hannity or picking ten at night is actually Seventy that I think are in play that will determine in the balance of power

wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over\nRedux a we have our good friends John McLaughlin and Doug Jones is with us welcome both the back to the program thank you thank you I don't think there's any doubt the cabin on overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nAs now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and send them out in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulation the businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash of about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm\nMcCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nWe have pulled their because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nIf you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the job to take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unbearable among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent unfavorable among independents\nWomen that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it that they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York I have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got I got\nTaken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat problem is not me and it stems cells are streaming service or write to\nMe was it that there are actually are conservatives certainly noticed that it's not\nIt's simple no one has tons within a rifle no need\nUh um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment\nUh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be I Know you governor governor they love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would\nNot be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no\nNo income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yeah I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left chat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in midterms\nIn our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be garden governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up for the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John do I have your support to work with Sean when we find the state or nation for him to run and for the highest\nCould operate we can go now to yes or no he could run down when they're on\nLike your ... your way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook\nRight now [laughter] I've never looked at it I didn't know freaking idea what's in there [laughter] oh my God\nI Know you're not exactly run for the Supreme Court but if if no check out\nThose are the half of my junior my junior and senior year I was tending bar till four thirty in the morning a lot of nights and\nYou know I was just tell you I didn't show up half the time so that's probably a good thing people don't even recognize that I went there with lots of witnesses yeah I'm sure there as well quote dig 'em up somewhere from forty years ago uh All right John McLaughlin and Doug Jones thank you both for being with us\n\nMm\nUnderway in Milwaukee object pigs every weekend for baseball has begun with game one of the national league championship series Dodgers and brewers and now they're going to the bottom of the third at Miller Park with the Dodgers on top one to nothing thanks to a\nSolo home run in the second for many Machado off of ... all of us who was gone after two innings right now\nBut ... is the picture but he is likely going to be pulled as well wait and ... on the ballot for LA and he was a lot a couple of hits but again the Dodgers had the lead one to the I think it's the first time the brewers have trailed this postseason and how important is game one\nOf the winters got out of what a loving of the last Thirteen series game ought to be ALCOA set for tomorrow night at Fenway with\nRed Sox aged Christian Bale talking to the media today about basing the Astros and their race Justin ...\nLow really worried about the pitcher I'm face to face in their little happy at all so we know we're up against you know he's he's obviously one of the ... so I'm like I said you just struggled all the same way and moved to go up there in\nRome the NFL today was the day after for the giants after the brutal watched last night to the eagles Eli Manning face the media again\nIt said he knows he has to play better\n...
