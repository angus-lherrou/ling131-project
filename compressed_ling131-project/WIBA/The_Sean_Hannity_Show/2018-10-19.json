Fox News Turkish officials released a video that appears to be connected to the disappearance of journalists demolished Yogi Bear is\nThat is exactly what Michael theater said afterward if there was any game that they needed to rise to the challenge this was it and as I said the defense is there's tremendous credit for keeping them in the game and the running games really been there the whole season Jonathan Taylor Garrett gross check in Taiwan dealer all averaging over six yards per carrier there\nAs a team averaging over a yard better than they were last year so\nYou can see that there is progress there but you need to make big plays in the past in game it it wasn't there ... blonde up completing seven twenty passes for a hundred yards with a touchdown and two interceptions and there was a stretch\nFor middle and the first quarter for the end of the fourth year where they were twelve consecutive and completion than you got to be able to keep the chain moving on third down and that's not what happens yeah they didn't\nUh I don't know that there was a complete pass and the second and third quarter right and there was not yeah so he starts three for three and gets off they're pretty decent start you're thinking okay this is moving in the right direction because the ground game I don't know if you felt this way but in this isn't to suggest that Jonathan Taylor doesn't run\nIs about all every time but he had a little extra punish into him I thought Saturday Night I thought there was a little bit more\nViolence in his run that he was it was bigger for him\nYeah he went over a hundred yards which is not easy to do in Michigan he says is that the top prank defense in the country to get them teen carries for a hundred and one yard and he's been that way the whole season he brings it no matter what\nAnd I was talking to Russia not too long ago about the ... there are things about Jonathan game that maybe go under appreciate it you see that eighty eight yard run against the ... that he pops in the second half\nAnd that's what you remember but you don't always notice the five yard five yard for yard run that keeps the chains movie and he was able to do that against Michigan but again you cannot be one dimensional as an offense against the ... the fence in the country that\nEnded up being the telltale sign of that one is Wisconsin ended up on the short in thirty eight Thirteen just for a moment here I'm\nIn Michigan [noise] seem looks pretty good shape Patterson changes what they do often simply he is his greatest capability he can put it down and run 'em a changes the dynamic of how Michigan has looked when they got possession of the ball\nHe does and the reduction game really paid off big time and I don't think you look at the lift depicting quarterback they stay well shape Patterson is the quickest or the most athletic but the way he operates out of that often makes it extremely difficult as evidenced by that eighty one yard run he had he pulled the ball back\nHe got around the left dead and everybody kind of got sucked up into the middle because it looked like the tail back was going to have a ball Patterson runs down the left side line for anyone yards and Russia while he was finally tracked him down but that's the type a big hit her that you have to be able to prevent and that's part of what makes Michigan's often special riding\nGain a little bit of a different perspective of who Michigan is in the east as it relates that we won't see unless we do in the big championship game won't see Ohio State in person but now that you've seen Michigan person a impressed with their ability maybe in\nThe east absolutely it at that kind of been the one thing I guess among uh a couple of others that have\nYou talked about Jim ... taking over as coach and it's well when is Michigan going to compete for any title it hasn't happened yet obviously that is still in play right now at Michigan Ohio State is looming as one of the biggest games in college football but it also makes you realize how good the heat is Wisconsin that dominated the west for so many years since they went to the Clinton twenty fourteen\nAnd yet [noise] Michigan wins by twenty five points in Michigan hasn't competed for the east ever in the switch\nAnd we get in touch on is he in a little bit but when you think of the Big Ten west side of the division northwestern is actually there at three in one that their comeback when improbable is a is a nice way to say\nFor Nebraska it's a disaster how they lost that game but if you're looking at the Big Ten west [noise]\nYou're thinking Wisconsin Iowa but now northwestern actually tops the sanding it three in one of the badgers at two and one for due to in one or two in one [noise]\nSo you think of the road games coming up north western a week from Saturday and just a little bit further down the road that trip to Purdue on November the seventeenth\nYou begin to see how this western side of the big is going to shake out oh yeah it's\nHuge and no question Wisconsin got itself an early advantage by going on the road and beating Iowa think we thought going into the isn't Wisconsin and I were the two teams to feed in the west because that's how it's been in the last four years\nI was going to have had a lot of trouble historically an Avon and going to North western and winning now they were able to do it a couple of years ago but I remember going down to the game I think with twenty fourteen milk Gordon ran for over two hundred and fifty yards Wisconsin lost that game so\nI certainly wouldn't write off north western and there was this year it's going to be very interesting and you mentioned her do as well that's not going to be easy because the boiler makers\nHave come an awfully long way in a short period of time on her head coach Jeff from yeah it's a\nPretty interesting game Saturday as well with for doing Ohio State you think of the early game Michigan Michigan State or goes opposite of Wisconsin in the eleven o'clock games but that go into West Lafayette I mean I don't know that there's been a bigger game West Lafayette in the last decade or just going to get a jacked up and be a big ...\nGas going to be fun and maybe the west can represent in a way that we haven't seen certainly Purdue is going to be a heavy underdog but the boiler makers can somehow win that game then you start to look at them a little differently a boy because they said that for the ... this year so that's a\nPrime time or they got to bring in Moscow lighting system and and the like at Purdue because there are I mean that they don't get many prime time not since Drew Brees left [noise] so uh we'll jump deeper into what Wisconsin has an how

the great Dane puppy Brewing Company which is where we are the great Dane problem Brewing Company\nHas held day old is your destination for game day gatherings you're official coaches radio show sponsor as well so we talked about Wisconsin we did this off the top today\nFrom a passing games standpoint obviously the low water mark of the year was what they did or didn't do plug in Michigan is was that the aberration and what is the thought process with Paul Christian Ted deal more about how they roll forward in the throat\nSo I think if you're looking at that film you have to say that's probably the low ... the even but we'll have to see the thing that\nYou look at you look at the numbers well Alex completed seven of twenty passes but it's easy to say the blame should go on him because he's the quarterback but in talking to these guys throughout the week\nThey will tell you it's not just his fault it's been a number of issues and the thing that is so surprising is we didn't expect it to be the case that right I remember reading before the season is has a chance to be one of the three best officers\nProgram history and a lot of that was because of the office of weapon I\nThink the all kinds of line and struggled in some regard in past protection and Joe Rudolph the office of coordinator into line coach that this week that they were two instances of communication issues in that game one with the line communicating something to the ... and one was a communication issue within the line and and Joe is not very pleased to say the least about that\nThese guys think they're close when they're eleven guys on the field in one person's making a mistake each player every other play it it's not going to work out and so it's been communication issues on the line\nAlice maybe making an error throw he said he felt during that Michigan game he got fed up paying his progression any didn't need to be but Michigan being the best defense industry they're going to do that to you and receivers as well have to do their part and when they're one on ones and run the re route yeah and there were\nA couple of things there there there were times in that game now certainly the last trip in their ... broad um didn't have a good first appearance at Michigan and this one lived up to that unfortunately secondly\nIt seemed at times as though the the secondary from Michigan was running Wisconsin's Ralph's I mean they are talented on the back in and I thought many times they had really covered up Wisconsin's receivers exceptionally well yeah\nThat's why they're the best path defense in the country and they had a pretty good run defense as well so\nThat that's a big part of it can Wisconsin's receivers that we're\nVery proud of coming into the season because of what they did late in the year last year when Clinton was injured [noise] can they win those one on one match ups been even if they run the right route and they are open it doesn't necessarily mean the fall is going to get there and as I said earlier was constantly Rand forty nine place so how many opportunities like that Paul has said\nThroughout the week you only get so many kick the can when you don't even run fifty place so you have to be able to convert in those one or two opportunities that you're going to get here and when you\nThink of individual moments you know we do this uh many times more and more often again a baseball game yesterday when the brewers had the runners at second and third one out in the third inning you needed one more deal I think of the badgers drive maybe you have this subjects on this but\nThe fumbled snap the Wisconsin's driving the ball or at or near midfield things are beginning to look good that put them behind the scenes I Believe the very next probably was the fact that the kids can come back even further so those are the mistakes that you just have a hard time overcoming\nYeah absolutely you can't get behind the change I think it was second in one at that time was that fumbled snap exchange and they lose the yard isn't and ultimately the drivers stalled\nBut Wisconsin was to for eleven on third vantage and traditionally the team is very good on third down and so\nThey didn't put themselves in the best position but even when they got to a third in short they they kind of work in between ... and it didn't always work out the only convergence they had to third and one but there was a\nThird and five early in the game one of Alex is early completion three are Kendrick cry or well you need five you get three you wind up hunting and so that stuff starts to add up and and it had been on that\nIs the the flood didn't pass right I mean that that pass was going one place and got to like that and went to prior is that the one you're referring to on the very first Dr I think you're right it pretty ordinary ... there were many in that regard\nYou know you're taking and there's a learning progression here J. burgers and likely comes out of that game with a better understanding\nOf how the game works at the high level which is the first time he's been on the field with a high you know are against that talent talented a defense and I'm sure there's a learning curve there for him [noise] oh yeah\nHe's going through this for the first time and a lot of these guys that are really young are experiencing some of the stuff for the first time and Jake is kind of been I don't know if a revelation is the right word because we knew he was talented but what he's been able to do in his first season ...\nHas been phenomenal he's picked up or truck from golly left off last year and become one of the safety valves for Alex ... broke\nI mean he was a number to recruit added as a tight end out of high school has a Madison product and he got in the pie on the off into scout team last year and even during spring ball there was a lot of praise and high for him but he has lived up to it and they need it and I said this before when you're receivers\nIs it's not working out in the way that you hope you got to have other guys in so Jake Ferguson has been there and Derek ... is another very underrated player who's emerged as not only a good half black or in third downs scenarios\nPut a good receiver as well so how has some different guys that he can spread the ball around to but again you have to do it consistently and everybody all eleven guys have to be on the same page to make it work\nSo let's get a quick update on the new rule exempt place this year the Ford game rules bars are registered a little bit of an update their ... and now he's been told up because that that game levels there is no registered for him but there still are options for others\nBut wild goose is in a position where this is his freshman year this is why the richer rule is so good because\nMaybe somebody you don't know if he's ready right away and if the whole retrofit it looked at it if you play on one game wild ... gone right and now you can test somebody out playing a game early and\nI wrote about this a couple of weeks ago but in the season opener if I'm not mistaken there was an instance where\nI think it was around Harold he his helmet came off so fun to rent to really have to come out for a play Tim Leonard the defensive coordinator is looking around on the sideline for any defense the fact that you can find [noise] and while he was the first guy that he sees it starts to put his helmet on and then Leonard and hold them off the field he realizes what this could mean are we going to waste the game for one play right so you don't know how it's going to play out\nBut then you gentlemen and he does really well and then he gets fifty plus naps two weeks ago and then he does well again against Michigan and it's like I think we're going to need them for more than the ... and there's a\nDifference between you know in the past wild goose would not likely not have had access to his helmet to grab it if it's one plate burns your season right there there is no mistaking us one play burns again ... or even then it's\nVery important but obviously quite a bit different than it was just last year in forever before he has a different strategy and you know they can use guys on kicked off for the first three or four games on kickoff coverage to get that experience in early in the season it seemed like they were trying to sprinkle in okay wow goose gets again here ... here\nBut they're so depleted right now that they need those guys to contribute and so\nIt is a little bit different strategy throughout the season but I I think it's still beneficial because\nHe can play someone up to four games and if they're not ready you pull him back and if they already well now they get to play when otherwise they would have had to sit on the bench and not be able to help the team this\nYear absolutely before we wrap up tonight we'll visit a little bit on what we expect from Illinois on Saturday when we come back we'll hear from a very young and talented Wisconsin hockey team that got a couple of big wins over the weekend there on the road Clarkson\nFriday night and St Lawrence Saturday Night but we'll hear from one of their young goals scores from over the weekend with prime post it will do that and a couple of minutes as we continue on badger prime on the badgers sports network\nLook around you

owned the badgers sports network a welcomed by the Jesse temple back into our conversation\nJust from a personal standpoint you in over the course of the next few weeks will be kind of\nA double dip in a little bit to how do you manage the time in what you devote to badger basketball in what you devote to badger football\nFor let me start by saying I Love this time of my favorite and I love basketball so for example today Paul Chris met with the media for five minutes that he does every Thursday in the morning and I spent the day working on a twenty five hundred word basketball story so sometimes the way you have to uh\nTo spend your time is a little bit different but uh you know the goal for me it's right the very best story I can whatever sport is going on and so that's that's kinda how I Do it but\nThe most part of the next few weeks it's mostly football I mean there was one of the basketball team as the red white scrimmage on Sunday but things don't really get cranking until early November but November and December awfully busy that yet are going to\nBe a very busy months in November when Wisconsin takes on Rutgers of road game at Penn State and at Purdue back to back and then Minnesota at home on the Saturday following Thanksgiving and then hopefully there is one more game in December that would follow that before a bowl game but we'll wait\nAnd see on that one quick thought here before we take\nOur final break and that is about the badgered events we talked about the use being served in a secondary they also were able to get to the quarterback and blood pressure on the quarterback fairly consistently on Saturday Night at Michigan which is something to see if it hadn't been able to do\nBefore that has there been a change maybe turning the corner in that regard\n[noise] well I think it's certainly encouraging in terms of turning the corner I'm TJ Edwards has been able to set his game up they did have three ... Michigan for that they only had five sex and the entire see so\nI think maybe they've dialed up something to find something but again I think it's a game by game that don't have as they allowed him out this week endangered in Gainesville continues to come back from injury so when they can get all the pieces in place it's going to be an even better\nWhen you mentioned the dead words he is at five TSLs and three sex over the last two games so\nI'm beginning to ramp up his production on the field will get you all set for what happened Saturday when the align iron sound that game kicks off eleven

point going on here\nCongress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work commission and good let's work has been vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver\nFrom the public statements that these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less and transparency and by the way these aren't simple mistake that have gone on you know we've talked about this\nNinety nine

New York university Rutgers law well why does he get to accept the speaking be junket when he's the head of the ... division\n... God only knows I'm so glad you raise the subject though because two days ago delivered to my hotel room in New York where they tape recording to show how you know this has been going on for so long\nIt's a tape recording of informants who Andrew Weissmann used at the time to testify against an Hawaii against a certain ... to ... in New York and on this have informants talking about life seems to have unlimited power this is going back into the nineties now it does with every once\nIt gets away with it every once and by the way I Am in touch with a person from that hey who would certainly repeat that I'm just going on for\nFour days before is this tape something that would be a big problem and Mr Weissmann is live\nI don't think I Would hope so but but this guy has ... ... ... forever you recorded before judge shift and wrote specifically how they should be brought to the bar and that that district here that letter was replaced by another one that took his name out of Mr mother and use Mr White as his right hand man since this time of the FBI\nAnd afterwards he knew\nWhat he was getting what do you what white spin on this team a liar and a cheater I'm Sorry to say the most unethical\nRight I got a I've ever encountered because of the constraints of time we will be following up on what you're saying there are they are David shown thank you\nAlso Carter Page I think you might want to hear the tape to thank you for being with us we appreciate your time both of you I'm All right as we continue from we are in Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh for the full hour

this is going to trigger because from that day forward it triggered a mass psychosis and you're a liberal news media and all things or democratic in the country but it's possible we're in this game listen to this take\nJohn ... from the national review the he think around and twenty\n[laughter]\nLike\nYou said the ... the chronically won't Cicero does having been saying that he will run for president as a Republican which is the prize Inc inside just to him he was running as a joke\nFor right now we have here is about Seventy five or eighty percent favorite we bought up by double digits Ashland for all the way we were reading of Florida\nNorth Carolina Ohio leading in Nevada I could go on and on and on\nA competitive waivers will not be president [noise]\nAnd so right now Mr Trump to answering calls for honesty I just want to say [noise]\nYou're not going to be president All right\n... your way in common with a\nLot of people laughed at me over the is now they're not laughing so much I'll tell you\nI think that it goes down as one of the best pieces of artwork that our team is ever put together Jason Ethan Linda who's here yelling at me all day in Florida are joining us yes we do they do see he is the host echoes the Fox and friends as I watch every morning or the Brian ...\nYou know this is how great my friendship with the EU is why the do she wrote a cookbook that comes out\nThree weeks before election day and we love having you on the program anytime we are going to talk about issues a cookbook\nThree weeks before election day and I'm like why a cookbook and I thought about it because we all get so stressed out during the election cycles that people need to go to page one eighty one\nGoing to get my corn beef and cabbage recipe and the good thing is that comfort food that makes me feel better you know when I stress to eat because of of wanting to win this election so bad how are you\nI'm doing great Sean Hannity thank you very much listen it's time for America to hand it ties their kitchens because aren't you change may be\nI think I really am the only thing is there's a part of me to thinking well do see does a long interview with me\nAsked about what my favorite comfort food is what I really like more than any than say corn beef and cabbage I just love it and I can't make it that much because of a make a corn beef I eat the whole thing I don't stop it's like it's like carrot cake in some ways one of those things you can't stop either a chocolate chip cookies\nBut the leadership of the Democratic party is blind it either on\nWell there's no question about that the Democratic party leadership including in the media are obsessed with their hatred for Trump and so you think\nThey are so the wine doing blindingly enraged by if they then assume everybody else is\nExactly they think that's going to produce the voter turnout didn't ... during the presidential election that would change the leadership of the house what\nYeah okay you're kind of on my same page here I'm you know I'm looking at what has changed it's going to reverse the fortunes of the Democrats are losing elections who have not been turning out voters\nIt isn't issue related because they're not proposing proposing any and they're certainly not advocating and they all they're doing is ripping the bullying and so\nSo your theory is that they are fooling themselves that they're they think they've got this massive hate Trump movement out there that they've created that's going to show up in droves and sweep Republicans out of office\nAnd most Democrats are admitting that the economy doing well and they may not like the president techniques but they have to admit that\nWhy now wait a minute wait a minute what most Democrats where are you seeing most Democrats big grudgingly admit that the economy's doing well\nI unfortunately my entire family democratic that per man I thought a lot of Democrats because they're nice people\nOkay what are you are including them that that that there's not just your your like your family that that has been grudgingly admitting things are getting better they do not blindly hate Trump\nDon't they don't why only a drop in it don't feel like they both got our matter\nWhat so you're telling me they're not all that excitement to show up and vote\nExactly [noise] so\nNow you're you're calling from Tallahassee what are your what is your family's thoughts on Andrew Gillum\nI'm dangerous [noise] in a good way are bad was\nIt not I'm not sure dangerous can ever be good but it ...\nWell I'm the most dangerous man in America because it's good\nAt it at at work at it can be good daylight hours on Andrew Gillum is a democratic candidate for governor here he's up against Ron the Santa and I'm the guy the guy is um\n[noise] in dangerous is the right word but your family mostly Democrats are not into the guy is that what you're saying\nWell most of my family in the mid west [noise]\nWhat about Democrats and you know so the Democrats the really nice people do\nThey are and and none of them or ill because they watched it back as mayor of happy it when you ask them about it they looked at their shoes and they shake their at\nAll right so this does it look all of this is ... by the way the word is a and\nE. C. D. O. T. A. L. ethnic total some people think it's anti does all\nThat would be against adults all and there's no such thing as against ... there's no pro does all there is no anti Donald business and neck don't all and it just means it's unscientific here say it's it's you know a person talking to four or five others and it's really dangerous desert projecting\nYou talked to four or five Democrats so think Trump's okay man not the best guy but the economy's going great but I I don't think I'm going to vote you can't take out those four people and make it scientific that the Democrats are going to have a turnout problem even though that's what Mike is as postulated hearsay hit his point is\nThat the Democrat leadership in the media leadership is really kind of alone they are enraged they are blinded by their hatred\nSo much so that they think everybody like them hates Trump and this is going to drive Democrats back to the polls more than anything has since Obama in two thousand eight [noise]\nAnd it's the old it's the old negative there is such a thing as negative turnout\nBut it's not meant as it's being the negative turnout is your turn out to oppose some thing that you are Michael e wary of or afraid of\nAh the kind of negative turnout we're talking about here is Democrats turning out in droves be cause they um despise Trump and and so forth and he's just saying he doesn't think that exists all across\nAnd threw out the Democrat Party we will see time will tell you not too long [noise]\nCelebrating the American way more than you I mean we're\nTo tell you why\nMy friends I enjoy

then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there\nAre people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock as a rock star you can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border where the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and\nGet an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their ... and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nAt so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful now the president\nWell he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about\nIt's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws and we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex where Scott has killed himself and done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I maybe it doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just for lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy\nThat is why project very

don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's
