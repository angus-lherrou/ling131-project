Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her\nGeneral story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial drug or and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do and I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute but everybody's talking hunted with a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I didn't know and the FBI added\nNo excuse me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick\nThird shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women\nYou have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not during the negotiations that I don't expect that you would expect and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nSo the judges are college roommate being on at the last twenty four hours a keen about uh the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show they found\nSomething of course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence I Believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and they take action and that is why you're going to see on the ... a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know there's a talking point what was on a second I Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nElse are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Daniella ... case\nAnd being on the opposite side of the ... the FBI just\nDidn't know what else can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bouncing ball about ... if there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know if she got home\nWe don't even know the house which you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of

Michelle was in North Carolina next Michelle happy Thursday glad you're whether it's welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nShot at all I can talk to you on I'm wanting to say I absolutely agree with you I think something one of the reasons why it's so desperate that we all read that ... the ... the Democrat Ted systematically raped\nAll of checks and balances the train that tree branches of government they are now using the judicial system and a weapon I guess at the early ... and ... and it's time for us to stand out and that\nCan make a law firm asked me that long ago and we had they they purposely gone against police officer and it's all just systematic now they want for us to try cases\nIn the court of public opinion and it's not how the United states that are on the United states is a different country because of our lives and because of our judicial system and because of our law enforcement agencies and if we can uphold down we will fail to be a constitutional republic and will be no better than any other dictatorships and the horrible\nYou know things that you see happening in other places in the world\nWas and this is what makes us unique this is what makes us special this has worked very well for us in in our two hundred and fifty year plus history\nThis is what keeps America different there are countries where your guilty until proven innocent um I uh things have gotten so overwhelmingly over the top so extreme\nIn each case where where judge Kavanaugh has been accused and the accusers mention names of people and whatever evidence that they would have to corroborate their story it has fallen apart each and every time\nWe watch this man go through the agony of crying repeatedly on national TV Now we hear some senators saying well he may not have the temperament looking out angry he was when he was defending himself\nWell I I don't know what they think the appropriate response is if you're accused of drugging\nYoung teenage girls and systematically raping them on an almost weekly basis I don't know what the appropriate response is but I think if I was innocent and somebody said about me I'd be pretty pissed off and I want people to know I Want people to see\nThe righteous indignation in in me that I did not do this\nAnd the passion that that that is behind that those words that I Am speaking that's not me that's not who I've ever been that's not who I Would ever be I'm not that person I never did that how do you say that in a way I mean he's posed to say it like\nNo I'm a Minnesota these charges\nNobody's going to believe that most human beings as I felt the judge Kavanaugh as the ... role I bet you he's never been that angry and emotional and his wife\nBut the circumstances warranted it based on the seriousness of the allegations against him I don't know any other way that a human being would otherwise react\nAbsolutely I call that righteous indignation these are quite believe that I Believe that the man has spent his entire life wind can be a judge and get everything that he needed to do to get to that position and he is also like you said and multiplication the justice system flock to itself it\nNot I don't watch local TV that much but I Know that I Am not\nA good example of a cross section of the country a lot of people watch local TV and as such are inundated with political ads and we keep hearing people are tired of them but they keep running them because of the political consultants believe that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard and it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign ad that doesn't affect me I\nKnow who I'm going to vote for before I see an ad and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\n\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch local TV they can avoid all those ads and a lot of people are not\nImmersed than this stuff like I Am and maybe you too and so they are influenced by these ads I have to keep reminding myself\nThat these ads and the the spending of a voluminous amounts of money does matter\nI just I have a tough time I see how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now I I folks I really mean it I think\nGiven what we've seen since Trump was elected the Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever\nThis country needs to rise up and reject these people I Know their voters are not going to reject them but\nI don't believe that the majority I think these people need to be skunk their behavior\nIs in terms of decency common decency these people must not be rewarded for what they're doing destroying people destroying institutions destroying concepts in our rule of\nLaw I shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff\nYou know it used to be the you know the economy was great just by living through it but now you apparently have to be told that it's good you have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV as to tell you the economy's good then you have to believe it\nWell I remember a time where when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well did you didn't need to be told you know it but now we got the Democratic party out there saying it's not a great economy tax cuts are ruining everything\n[noise] him some don't cost you believe this stuff [noise]\nYou'll you'll reject what you're living and believe what you're
