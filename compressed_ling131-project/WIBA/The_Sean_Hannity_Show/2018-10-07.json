is you know as we've been getting more involved with these hospitals around the country and even parts of the world games are actually helping with the health care process\nWe have examples of maybe patients who had a high degree of anxiety video games are introduced to help them cope with treatment\nAnd nurses and health care professionals had a much easier time doing their job thanks to the introduction of video games\nI'll tell you a quick too quick stories actually one of the first story we're actually working on this case that it really severe burns on the side of his arm and every few days nurses were coming in changing at his bandages and got to a point where like six nurses are holding this kid down because he was so anxious over the process somebody found out he likes playing lego Batman so they wield and one of our gaming guards\nLet them play this game for a little bit of sort of ease his mind and got the point where instead of six nurses only two are needed to complete this process\nOne to a sort of take the kids Armand your change of the bandage the other to hold the second end of the controller so he could keep playing this game this is only concerned and so all of a sudden\nYou know the kids excited lowered he had a better healthcare experience because of video games the nurses had an easier time doing their job and then there's probably an economic argument to be made for the hospital because all of a sudden these for other health care professionals can go around and help other patients rather than working with this one\nThe second store I tell you real quick actually um children's Los Angeles at the hospital made a video about this particular patient\nA there was a kid who was waiting on a heart transplant he was in the hospital for ten months\nAnd the doctors didn't want him to leave his room or the media hallway outside of Israel so it was almost like White House arrest ... yeah yeah it's almost like imagine being in an airplane and not feeling well and they're not really being able to leave that plane ride a for a year that that's what this kid was going through\n'em and the hospital ... documented process thankfully there is a happy ending he end up getting a heart transplant you know he's better now but at the time his mom actually credits Minecraft\nFor him maintaining his sanity no while he was in the hospital they would give him my craft and with every single day he'd play with his friends when they got out of school it was like their digital playground\nSo yeah I mean we've even had instances where are we deliver to gaming car to a hospital and then there's been like a waiting list on daily basis for kids to play on it multiple times we've had patients come forward who have fun race to build more a even a children's LA there was a group of kids they reach forty thousand dollars nearly forty thousand dollars\nTo build like a whole fleet for the hospital wow yeah so the the feedback we get I mean we get incredible feedback from health care professionals patience and I think the growing thing we're having now is is formally sort of documenting this stuff so we can talk about it more like a kind of an academic sense\nSo where is gamers outrage looking to go from here in terms of you know growth an expansion you know my opinion is wherever there are gamers gamers should also be\nWhen we go into the hospital my arm and ultimately we're we're really trying to reach our fellow gamers right I mean we we noticed some extent maybe there was a kid who has never play video games before they might enjoy you know time spent on the go cart that's great but\nThen the most part we're really looking to you know help support these kids that otherwise don't have access to what they're used to you know outside the hospital environment\nAnd it's really surprising if you go into a lot of health care facilities there's been a lot of focus and prioritize nation of research and treatment\nWhich rightfully so is objective number one right like if you go to the hospital the goal is to the hospital absolutely because of that though sometimes quality of life kind of takes a backseat and that's what we're focused on we think of ourselves as they were going into these environments and we're trying to ultimately improve a patient's quality of life while they're receiving treatment so help to kind of\nInspiring help you with the healing process through means of entertainment um so there's a a number of answers your question I think for one we want to be reaching these hospitals and helping them provide gaming concept to patients and that takes kind of a variety of forms\nA there's a lot of work still to do to make video game content accessible lot hospitals don't have the hardware or even you know like gets by video games in the hospital arm and that's kind of part of what we do\nAnd then even if sometimes they do are willing to invest they often don't have the staffing required to support that equipment so people can forget about\nAnd like if you don't need an X. box to a hospital that's great but as to hook up don't have to get up they had to move it around and I mean you think about other gamers right to go to a land party there's a lot of effort ... Khan or something you have to get my PC I go to my friends so it's hard enough to convince each other to like come to a land\nImagine if you work in a hospital and ten different kids will play video games and it's not your job as the video games as your job to keep them alive right uh you're probably not gonna have time to like\nMiddle of the X. box or whatever it is so again that's what we're focused on building these tall so lots of hospital so we need to support their every hospital has what we call the saturation point which is okay how many gave me carts is it or what is your ideal environment\nEntertaining environment sort of look like or how do we help you meet that and then of course there's this idea of expanding globally around the world there are cameras everywhere\nWe helped game or to get involved on their own independently well ...\nThank you so much Zack from gamers outreach joining us here on checkpoint thanks so much from ...

I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to believe that any of these people um it it can take themselves seriously they said it's\nGoing to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she said that every Democrat that now they're going up\nBut Trump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization you know it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit and the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nThey saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are\n... but but it up you know the parents do auto reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know well the ... back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory\nUm which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your habits very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents\nAnd answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them or there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave instructing page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the soul to the earth people and I said of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look in his company's coming MO right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their ... with a investigator it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI does to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing\nWhat they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't as ... as well make that can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's my prediction\nWe're down to that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted a former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThem more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why did he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or because they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I mean ... or even count as a credible allegation but you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to make a whole new wins and they don't make any recommendations they're just going to give very handover the information\nIt the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said in
