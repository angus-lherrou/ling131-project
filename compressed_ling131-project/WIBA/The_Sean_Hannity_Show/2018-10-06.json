on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm Susan\nCollins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out of me were opinion so I think what stands out more than\nAnything else is the the since here come the amount of gravity that she gave to her decision and her speech\nAnd the gravity of the moment in an an bringing literally\nA sense of sanity\nTo what has become an absolute as she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from George cabin on his judicial temperament the questions that he specifically answered her passion about\nUh especially than I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice and consent\nAnd the respect that she is showing the constitution the process\nAnd the whole process of a role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins said yes and Jeff Flake saying he is a yes\nOn camera and all that now brings us to well Lisa Murkowski simulators ... know that brings us to fifty or what forty nine fifty one forty nine yeah so that brings

is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning\nAt length about the process\nAnd what this has now become a and talk about being a a gutter political campaign and millions of dollars and people in groups of people pledging to destroy her into feed her an upcoming elections et cetera\nAnd hum wow this is pretty amazing\nI was just an amazing speech eight

difficult race are you concerned debates\nAbout in this one I have had an ad that bought the Thursday you bother me at all\n[noise] All right that is\nThe ah [noise] well that's the party of Nancy Pelosi if in thirty today she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and all the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know a party that is willing to put all\nDue process aside fundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with the guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments who's in the beginning of of senator Collins speech today and how she rightly pointed out there was opposition\nFrom day one Chuck\nSchumer was one of them there was nobody that President Trump that was that what was going to be nominated\nThat was ever going to pass the get many Democrats from the get go and I do believe that that\nJoe Manchin probably a shortage reelection with this decision today but I don't really ... I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today or that that really much impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you had the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant a week with uncommon eloquence and shown reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a come Halloween legal brief in support\nOf Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset Collins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was re county many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent duty and she announced her own standard\nFor considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there there were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all and said show under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was probably the most impressive by main her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I've said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the that\nJudge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that Collins each wrote

Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhere I really realized today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody I've interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this\nIs the seriousness the intellect the the systematic\nBe she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money\nThen that's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and\nShe had it ... it was obvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail
