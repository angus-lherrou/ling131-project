that fraud for me to report what these folks are saying and if\nIt was no one wrong then you wouldn't do you would be a criminal and you would be in jail but you go into states you know what the laws are it's one party consent you get these people on tape and they don't like what you report because what you've ... bows with Phil Bredesen\nIn Tennessee and his staff and Claire McCaskill and her staff and Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp and her staff in North Dakota now Christian cinema who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban in\nArizona is the same thing is that they're lying to their constituents they're running a propaganda campaign\nAnd they're acting like they are purposely misleading the people of their states\nTo make them think moderates when they're anything but and they're all all the people working for them or in on the boat secret which is don't tell the voters in those crazy voters in the meth capital of the world\nA meth lab democracy Arizona the state known in a

hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field and and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid

Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by\nLet me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east one super all because of the threat of Iranian Gemini\nAnd the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you\nKnow let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into\nWhat I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nFinally admitting that year old white nationalist\nAnd then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that are are linking George Soros and these anti Semitic threats to the caravan get Fox News talking about\nSmall pox and leprosy coming up it is I'm

a Muslim ban there is no white guy banned [noise] so what do we do about that\nI I just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning hosts suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be a hero in\nOn the two pillars of the media continuing hit the trail and attacks against\nAnd migrant continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank using some of the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms and invaders

people that gave us that they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from\nNancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's

because of his\nAnd what they are starting to learn which is what really drive them crazy this is not your typical conservative it's not your grandfather's a GOP based here\nThat the Trump supporter these people are fighters these people believe in this country as people understand that the fight for freedom is not going to be easy on that there's no finish line to it that resolve is really freaking out that live there used to these claims of no fear and intimidation\nAnd having the the the old a\nGeneration of people to back off white out of fear and all okay oh okay just go ahead you know to do what you got to do that doesn't exist anymore this\nParty that Donald Trump's party he's a fighter he's the one that has caused people like Lindsey Graham and others to start to show up back on Mitch McConnell to start to show back\nHome because they're watching given a feeding off his energy\nAnd he his tactics which are two never backed down counter punch a more a metaphorically speaking counter punch politically and then go back to the message and keep fighting and keep bringing it home where else would have brought a birthright citizenship world other genial the candidate\nA would've brought a birthright citizenship within a week of the election away they're so for you to do anything\nOnly Donald Trump ...\nHe's white on on on immigration he know that is the issue that is motivating this party right now and so some healing through it with this bird what works white thing no other GOP candidate water had the ball to introduce something like that six days before an election\nOn your absolutely without question correct on that something you said people are you know they're out\nThere they're going to fight for freedom this is a I think a group of people now a GOP that has animated by the concept of freedom itself\nAnd that was something we haven't seen since the since the tea parties and see the establishment GOP tried to put its boots on the neck of the Tea Party I think they are now I think they've now fully views I think when you see Lindsey Graham making speeches about the constitution and I don't just mean his his out standing efforts on behalf of the cabinet confirmation\nBut he has been on every talk show that will that will have and and he has been calling out the mob he's been calling out the violence but he's been calling out though it in a way that reminds people that their freedom is at risk so I think we actually have\nA party we may disagree on some policies here and there but we have a party now that has animated by America and buy American freedom\nAnd I think I Hope I Hope that's enough to get a spy on November sexed\nNot think it will be a really do you know what I'm trying to do is travel all across the country is to re instill a sense of urgency that we have to have about this and then there's a real\nSense of urgency I'm trying to I'm hoping that our borders are scared because of scared voter is a likely voter scared border is going to be an actual border whereas their sides angry\nOkay that's what they used for motivation but for the wrong motivation to use when we're angry and twenty six team twenty Thirteen but this time\nWe have to be secure we are to be afraid of waking up on November seventh and what this thing could look like under a Democrat house or for the Trump the gender will be stalled in good luck you'll hear nothing but\nA a piece for the investigation\nIs investigations for this there'll be there'll be passing a lot of stuff in the house they'll try to repeal the tax cuts won't have the\nAh choose to do it of course with no control the Senate or the White House but then they'll fill always builds up during and say hey look the Republicans are obstructionist going into twenty twenty I Am just some things done and all they're doing they're the party of no remember that you don't want to just\nBad so literally and they will and they know and they will own the narrative lock stock and barrel\nI'm here and fight I've said this is well this is what motivates Republicans is here and fight they got a fierce something they've gotta have something to fight for um I think freedom is pretty good thing to fight for sheriff Clarke thank you for coming on the program today thank you for making us number lucky number seven on your in your day\nIt's my pleasure as always good to have\nYou back you good to have you on the show up and take a break here will be back\nIf you got really good credit we can get you approved for just about anything you want\nBut spoke

high school student actually right here in Wisconsin\nSchool sports teach young people how to be\nInclusive learning to listen to accepting responsibility being good role model and just about respect\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel\nAnd yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nFor the Senate GOP shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country white man most radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop the main things about me I'll stop and signing angry and learning to kill you you know whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated for\nTrump is doing is stoking and fighting for the purposes of political power the worst\nAmongst us to take action in his named anybody who sits there and says if there is not causality between these events any insight match is dishonest as they are blind\nI don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that as being ... by the president of the United states the races\nFor some I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in anti Semitic followed\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump\nHated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promised to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic cause this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for dusty a full of Russian lives\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get five warrants unverified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the dusty I don't even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them for moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance for me that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of the threat of Iranian Gemini\nAnd the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think he's just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card he said I'm a nationalist saving do comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for [laughter] finally admitting that your own life nationalist and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that are are linking George ...\nSoros and the anti Semitic threats to the caravan Fox News talking about\nSmall pox and leprosy coming up it is I I'm Sorry I I won't say specifically what regime this is out of but go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy witch ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and Jews\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he said\nThat we have to stop demonizing people and not leaving ... biggest\nTerror threat in the country is white men mostly I'm radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy banned [noise] so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning hosts suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be a hero in on the two pillars of the media continuing his victory L. attacks against\nAnd migrant continuing to ratchet up\nThe language about them just and and frankly\nI mean I have to thank you think the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms and invaders and invasion for these tragedies working at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified hang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joyous\nPay heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also times got along with them as as cars out there who not only\nThat just like oh I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh he's in New York character not Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate [laughter] as far as I'm [noise] and I don't mean that an ad hominem sign [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they eat a ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWill be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do the fear at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that the election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white lashed out against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not it is they end up back in their head really fear you\nThe

that and I'll get to that in a second but now\nA poll numbers tagging going into the last week of the campaign now Claire McCaskill is getting more desperate now she's begging Missouri voters to believe her when she says I support President Trump a hundred percent on securing the border\nWell that's odd because I don't think I've ever heard Claire McCaskill ever chant or talk about\nBuilding that wall even once\nBut anyway she told the fake news CNN that she supports the president a hundred percent to do what it takes to secure the border quote the impression he's\nGiven Missourians there's ... ...

C\nI say with if you look real clear politics too old for locked in seemingly leaning likely Democrat on the house side and a hundred and Ninety nine locked in Republican side you have all these thirty some odd races that are now going to tip the balance of power of the house\nConventional wisdom says that Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker I don't look at the polls quite the same way Nancy Pelosi picking up the drapes\nA for her new office was on the Late Show with Stephen cold there are dictating Democrats would win big in the midterms let me say this up until today I Would have set up the election were held today we will win now I'm saying is we will win we will win we will when she added\n... a bit freaked out by ... competence please don't say that\nDo you want to say that that on Hillary's a firework firework barge that she cancelled later perform the sign of the cross on his chest and feel like I should sacrifice a goat or something to take the heck's off of what you just said\n...

we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside money coming in as well against David Young and\nHe joins us now apparently you know I Love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing healthcare healthcare although we welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but\nThey have people that gave us that they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care and it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going\nThe economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shock and correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages\nFrom Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of the playbook that the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nAnd abused it less and used
