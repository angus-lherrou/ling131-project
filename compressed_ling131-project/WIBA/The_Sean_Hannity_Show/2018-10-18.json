some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely the show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counselor wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably\nWill happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka\nFormer White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contribute a Thirty Years' CIA up operations officer\nA doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a bar Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the doesn't ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is dead\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often ... as the wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle however however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate\nThis man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures\nArab um the ... of the twenty first century a non ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil brutal brutal way possible and I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth\nRushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of the day that Chris Yogi entered and we know he just show again never exited the costs ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the fifteenth out for them apparently part of ... months if you're already seen one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly this numbering\n... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given for these fifty and Saudi and who gave them the orders and and to whom did they report posts for them\nThose are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were a shoe of greatest concerns what will get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when they gave it probably was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they needed a void speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would highlight is that Well Secretary palms hey was meeting and doing it is public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or in an outdoor up probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the ... all over the ... the um over the perfect on on the truth is wrong we have a lot of um average over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood times through a and B as the mom had been found them in a way that those relationships are not going to be tested but this is a nation\nThat revival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n... I Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we don't knowing the gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort God can I give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep deep sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood President Obama when he went on his global opponents tools and he started it in Egypt who worked in the front row of that event\nSitting there and show the environment find the Obama White house the Muslim Brotherhood's chief representative that how big a difference in the lecture and make sure\nYou know a Dan Hoffman what are your thoughts\n[noise] well you know this is a bit of a self inflicted whoa Shaun from the Saudis I mean if if\nThe two countries that are most pleased about if is Iran and Russia they did absolutely nothing to call what is the risk now between the United states and Saudi Arabia I really believe that there are certain elements of our relationship that has to be immune\nFrom the vagaries of our bilateral relationship just over the weekend former director of CIA John Brennan with whom you know I've had my differences a\nDebt that we consider halting routine intelligence collaboration that would do nothing but put our our citizens in our homeland at risk so we need to not do that uh and and while we consider policy measures I think the president is going to need to own that the the appropriate time there's a bipartisan consensus\n'em to go pretty far\nAnd and consider freezing military sales and sanctions I think the president is going to have to reach out to the Congress and manage that wins short as as the bats And Corker said that our interests um are are taken care of swimming national security perspective agree a hundred percent with Dr pork on that\nI Will take a break more within hopping Dr

[laughter]\nHere's Sean Hannity\nThere was a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on that why is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\nFor\nHigh end jet deal running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I Want to put Massachusetts first\nI'm jet deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax hikes and now I'm not just stop partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren tame Elizabeth Warren ... at least officers race from front to back\nMe I call them heroes\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this message\nThat is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\nThose ads by Jeff deal was born well she does have to get re elected a senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative Americans we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career for personal gain claims a family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nAnd tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm a non stop brown one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman is association is never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety ... here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm male focused on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nI remember that a life like membership is not reserved for just a precious few people everybody\nCan access the power of life locks computer programs including you and made more Americans than ever before are relying on why flock to monitor their Web activity for evidence that they're online identity maybe in the wrong hands but don't misunderstand me nobody spying on you\nWhen lifelike scans their clients it's not by name it's not it and it's not being the humans they have a\nGiant ... super computer that is able to track\nThe online behavior say credit card behavior of their members and and everybody establishes a pattern how much per month they spend a ... in general where they spend it and what lifelike as looking for is any exceptions\nAre outrageous exceptions to the established pattern\nAnd when they find one they don't wait they immediately notify the member and ask them hey we're seeing that you're doing X and X here would you not normally use this amount of money or do this and openness account is that you\nAnd if you reply that it's you and everything's fine they go away and nothing else happens if you reply that it's not you then they've caught somebody\nTrying to steal your online identity that's when it gets interesting that's when they start trying at that moment they start tracking down aware of this is happening who might be doing in hopes of catching them\nNow nobody can do that regularly I mean there's nobody that can prevent all identity\nTheft and nobody can monitor every transaction so they have a restoration team people in this country Americans do nothing but work with lifelike members who end up being defrauded and they stick with you until everything is resolved\nIt's that simple it's that necessary\nThis kind of crime is something that you're not aware of the moment of happens to you if you're a data is stolen from an online database where you're a member\nYou may not know for months or weeks\nThat you have been defrauded lifelike will lifelike dot com or call the eight hundred and four forty forty eight thirty three\nUse my name ten percent off and they'd twenty five dollar Amazon gift card when you use my name eight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three a gym in Pacific palisades California it's a gorgeous place how you doing Jim\nGray Russia are you doing fine thank you\nGod Bless you what you do out there listening to you for twenty five plus years this I just wanted to make a quick point about that whole caravan um I think it's a godsend for Trump because I Believe that Americans like me was that elected him\nYou know we respect to sing about this country fairness and strength and um you know the Kavanaugh hearing was going down before Kavanaugh's show strength and every time Trump shows during the\nGames you gains momentum and we found the military down there as a message and if the military treats everyone with respect a sort of almost like a enhanced FEMA\nThen I think this is going to be a net positive for him and if the Democrats trying to you know\nWhat do you think the Democrats objective with this is with the caravan\nYeah what do you think they're trying to accomplish with us 'cause somebody's behind it somebody's paying for it you know it's a liberal Democrat donors somewhere or a series up my ... on\nThe ... I think honestly rush\nThat Democrats plan is anarchy because they don't have a plan I think they they are just the proverbial party that throws everything against the wall to see what will stick because do you remember the or the science fiction film Forbidden Planet\nMm yes I rent me when I\nWas like a a a ... a monster that was made of energy that that was conjured up by this man I did was Walter pigeons brain and every time they attack it grew in strength it absorbs all that energy and that's basically what Trump is\nHe absorbs all the energy just makes them stronger\nIt makes the people that support him a digging their heels even even further down and it makes president war how comfortable and confident because\nHe's used to being attacked and it doesn't faze him you know and um I just think that the Democrats right now or in a point where they just are in a in a like a a fever and they can't figure out how to get this guy and they're going to throw anything and everything\nI Do I I I I Do think that they are seriously folks I don't I'm not saying this to be funny or outrageous to call attention to myself I I really think that in a large swath\nOf calling the Democrats are are the the American Left I think there is a creeping insanity\nThat has been building it existed it's been building since Trump won the election it has been building with every failure but they thought was a lock to get rid of him\nThe futility the fact that they're not even slowing him down or harming is driving them crazy because their experiences if they target somebody for destruction that person generally is destroyed\nAnd they can't even didn't Trump they were not able to begin with and I think they're\nPsychological disorders and I've been amplified into so called legitimate political issues and I think we're all in danger of these\nPeople feel awful rash only on\nYour alarm to link\nRainy day when you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America will ... will\nIt take skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secures safes in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secure part art\nPart furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhinos safe dot com veteran owned and veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

what\nThe fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to say they get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are\nThey can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five impeach forty five are claiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it ... now I don't want to talk about it\nJust don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment endless never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now I have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders they calculated that is going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline site tonic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs keep Obamacare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent\nGDP Growth in American history you know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them\nThe crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what they do the leftovers they have you\nKnow when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms or house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different\nSo that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watched this caravan\nYou've got to understand this is about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years\nAnd I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times side Hannity you've told us that before yeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego and many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated cast where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country is is one the one issue is oh kids going to grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet they try a bike and then a perk you said a Nazi con and\nThey go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give up\nRip it these kids die then when they find out they can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of theirs so why don't you try heroin does much better ... to ... ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it the light up in smoke it and then eventually going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called ... and all\nYou don't talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an ... which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you\nA hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what Kevin all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nThat no corroborating evidence I don't believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall purse they spike the punch bowl and after they bite the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they break the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I ... I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and and Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again\nAfter eight FBI investigations\nWhat are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got four million new jobs\nSince Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents a combined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting is rockets\nNobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians would would bear fruit but the Iranians are dying economically because of the president leading a boycott and then on top of that what record low unemployment fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace and youth unemployment\nWill do you want that to an end and the next Nineteen days what ... what what what are they offering you that is better give me the better alternative\nYou until they have that chance and property to stop taking all directions at gas and property dot com\n\nWe rode along where you

American people\nAnd the president is now saying we're going to stop you in your tracks and the president has now poll Mexico and Honduras um excuse me\nUh in the strongest terms I'm asking Mexico doesn't sound like an ask\nAt is stop the onslaught\nIf you're unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nThen he posted another one continuing to blast Democrats because they're the ones that won't open borders eliminate ice and sanctuary cities and free healthcare for illegal immigrants course free means you pay for it I'm watching the Democratic party led because they want open borders and existing week laws\nAssault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and whose leaders are doing little to stop the large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will poll aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in as far more important to me is president then trade and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fall weak laws that of course they don't want to build the boardwalk guess what it also means\nThat means more drugs coming into every small town a big city in this country\n[noise]
