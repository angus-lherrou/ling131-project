months no she didn't do that she waited 'til we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say go ahead\nAs we get Mr President you said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation\nWhat does it have to do is read I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is

opposite our country loves it or if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nOr an hour to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nOtherwise why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week\nIf they now want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person it literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt is this now uh we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now are we going to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate\nIn describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider and frankly at an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump the Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be\nDo you really want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending lady was totally uncorroborated assaults does that sound really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as can be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe similarly had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goal post now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein recommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and\nSending out letters saying uh we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality the fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassinate me or cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want\nAnd I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nKnow when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me know plumbing players trying for a minute because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh\nDeceiving example though you're getting you know one one Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying\nAbout having served in Vietnam when he didn't know suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty speaking about the defenders of slavery who were prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose then\nPlainly stated his that he will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruin an all events close quote I Dreamed I brought that up on his I really believe that's where we are\nI think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at ... at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promise last week which would be limited in scope and you know ... and an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer lower\nLonger which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it um I when you are but the point is I think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people\nBecause if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is nobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever or not we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication turn over a year or is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation\nThey they don't think the truth matters what matters is power and I think people need to understand\nThis election is a choice about which America we're going to become much made a choice and just the president this is literally about are we going to reward people who are this destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\nAnd insist on people

particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your habit very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents\nAnd answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never\nEver talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people\nAnd I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you can be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look in his company called me and low right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and has just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that that that's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAs their ... with a investigator it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI does to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individual ... that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my prediction\nUndemocratic IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigated\nMore shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before this whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even still share it with him she said what part of that he was in the room [laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I\nBut I Can't take her start to get hit it and so even after taking care of her lawyer for six days to kind of work up\nAt her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the New York New York and they all that that she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I practice or even if they cut about ... you know what\nGo for the FBI could talk to her and they'll they'll get their state and that and I think they look at the people out there\nThan it was only a guinea pig a whole New Orleans and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and maybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for three oh two forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and

life blood of the German economy\nAnd buying their energy from them why are they buying it from us\nBecause if they do it's it it weakens the one person the NATO alliance is supposed to be afraid of\nOr that the president is asking a European allies to step up with their unfair trade deals you know so that we've got an a brand new nobody thought it could happen if you don't demand and say okay we're not taking a one sided deal anymore well the president now has gotten new deals with Mexico\nAnd Canada and we find out that it brings trade piece to North America\nJust like we now have results nobody expected in North Korea and we now look at the deal and I was seeing the impact of the deal and to avoid tariffs Seventy five percent of car components have to be made right here in the

... yeah I'm wearing\nEdited or he just makes it it's absurd people will say that it just showed me how\nRidiculous leader and they are asked to the river and he lied to a community very important point an accusation of somebody like two to eating well testify under oath\nShe'll perjury okay that is something that it can only be investigated for criminal probe not come back on the rest of the nation but in order to start this investigation they have to be known about what is known as as a criminal world\nSo you need to have the Senate Judiciary committee for majority of the committee believes shopping is totally true but a majority of a community believes\nThe judge Kevin to lie to them under oath perjured himself we need to to send ... ... criminal referral\nTo a department of justice justice decide what would you justify opening investigation of course it's not going to happen because I don't believe a majority of Senate Judiciary committee would do that in fact I don't think but then all of the Democrats would would take this position somehow but not all\nSo again this is a perfect example coming two types of investigations\nA show that the whole issue of or not he misled the committee cannot be investigated as a part of a beyond because that again is an accusation of criminal conduct bought in a in a context that does not justify studying investigation\nMe if I were to say I think you know you you you broke below because he killed somebody last night that doesn't justify study investigation because it's completely absurd\nRight and I could just say no I
