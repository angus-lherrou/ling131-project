to\nMultinational corporations can fighting from by America policies for our infrastructure that distance is like foundry it makes manhole covers and has for a hundred and forty seven years I stood up to big farm around when they jacked up prices on\nOr something like savings Ron whether it be the iPad or an ass medication and all of these things are things that my opponent has not\nWhich is unlimited that takes care of the Ninety eight percent of whatever my needs happen to be but then I have to get a catastrophic plan the God Forbid I had the bad heart attack or the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight uh you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a good ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline then as simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill\nThat's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck ah docks where patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working\nReal life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician run health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with able to have conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of any health are plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services solid does is create a ... tour\nYou know where ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country where ... medical tourism or ... what we're finding is that\nYou know not not the same thing about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are how some shots wandering ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product\nSo a number I cashed price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of ... to pay for

for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nThat they're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shocked they gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody he whether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California you get sick um because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country\nBut the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of at the same day and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic planet if for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current race closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household [noise] ah the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send

slowdown\nBreast cancer chemotherapy treatments six dollars a month and we're talking about the best most advanced medicine that we have\nWell it it really depends on what the oncologist says is the best medicine for that ...

tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party but you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of ah you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic focal folk kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with cabinet all they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work at a back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me\nAnd hopefully the American people that somehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks um and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this\nIt was a process of the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation and likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy\nDam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have ginned up this rage ... not all but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow\nHim into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and then teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\n... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall or the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big\nIssues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four and more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point and it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt that will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near\nFuture yeah and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut it's great can tell you most of these cases that are over ... importance to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has was uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts\nAnd there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well\nSo this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come up and if Trump wins reelection bid may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority on the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nPrepare profit ... everything from crypto currency is or how

[noise]\n[noise] you are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show\nThem out on the show and on and off as a person and the truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable thriving and vibrant societies\nShe'll citizens from government over reaching\nMeans always yelling the facts [noise]\nEven if they run counter to our house\nAbout credible evidence\nStrong opinions\nAbout a lot of talk about Pfizer applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what a five ... five application is actually a warrant\nJust like a search warrant in order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know assigned ... David they get a Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ... well that was based on the bone eight Clinton bought and paid for dodge the aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that right\nFiring Jim Cole me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour that Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a end by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein\nSaid that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states in the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nBut the fact that there are no wires means everything you don't have to build out walls build them back you don't have

typical thing that you'd expect um we got a lot on the program we got this election and we're gonna talk about it in detail we have the riots over the weekend in New York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd followed them into the department stores and restaurants and gas stations what do you think is going to happen\nWhen those types of things are set\nAnd I looked at the end of the day people are responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this\nWas going to look back here have Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed and all of this and we'll get a

Sarah Sanders and our family and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife\nI mean at some point someplace somewhere something's gonna happen and if you didn't see it this weekend\nI mean you had a demonstration billed as a march for law and order in the streets of Portland descending into\nChaos as yet rival political factions now breaking into a bloody brawls downtown Portland on Saturday Night yet members of some group called the Patriot prayer\nI've never heard of them and their their black clad adversaries known as antifa using bear spray ... tons thrashing each other

they do something about it\nAt least ... to make one arrest Saturday Night not one but they are investigating this scene is unfolding amid tensions among both groups are fueled by impart uh some national news stories you had the marching in Portland against the police were brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's\nYou know they had a hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which was caught on tape that outrage many including\nUs some leader of this group out there patriot prayer in any way of viral law video surfaced showing in New York City members of the group which I also never heard of Proud Boys some type of male chauvinist\nOrganization a beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at a Republican headquarters\nThe way you have is you know I Know the media has been reporting that there were a group of white supremacist I don't I don't know anything about them\nBut there was a a hate\nRally at Republican headquarters in New York City anyway where you know the way the media is portraying it I just have no idea 'cause I don't have it but of courting to the Daily Caller and ... members actually vandalized the metropolitan Republican club in New York I had a an appearance of this\nGroup Proud Boys prompting an outbreak of violence they're fascinating that Andrew Cuomo the governor up for re election in New York is not going to have any trouble my opinion sadly he's blaming it on Donald Trump he blamed the president ... attacked the Republican headquarters in New

you're exactly right he all he has to do when he gets in front of a group like that has opened his mouth and say how much she hates Scott Walker and that's pretty much all he has to do um to get you know forty six percent in the state of Wisconsin 'cause that's about the built in hate factor\nUm that that's the residual leftover from at ten um but you know what is most of us actually need a plan here I Need to know if my taxes are going to explode because Tony ... is just the has decided that\nYou know the big ... big union bosses deserve more of my money than I Do I think small businesses need some insurance on what's going to happen to them because they're the ones filing is individual taxpayers if their taxes go up ten percent\nI think manufacturers and farmers need to know what happens if they no longer can count on on a tax credit for investing in Wisconsin I think everybody who works in all of these places needs to know whether or not we're going to make our hollow ourselves out in the mid west like Illinois has\nAs a whole that has that has less economic activity that is that isn't a depressive state while everybody else around us you know takes off like

jobs\nAnd our manufacturing production in the state\nHas grown almost twenty four percent since Governor Walker signed that manufacturing tax credit into law and that's important because manufacturing is the is the number one sector of our economy is by far and away the largest sector so to have seen twenty four percent growth\nA coming from this tax credit um what do you think's going to happen
