forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how does this passport news story\nWhen on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a a a systemic party culture where almost

the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see that was recorded this problem or a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are there just wasn't nothing to this story [noise] um\nAnd when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now

joined us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee a senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished\nAnd we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat\nDelaware ally Chris but he was never part of this agreement\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not and he's been honest about his drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWhen the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in its scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's ... hours so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake gonna end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nOr they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does\nThe Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump s ride they've already against ...\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada\nOr do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that ... Ford's claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two\nCollins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nWants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict that the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state ... state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any oh\nI'm doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or a political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we fall a vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness\nThe charge deserves I think ...

probably with Heidi Heitkamp I'm Joe Donnelly already said no who knows if he changes his mind but he's on record saying he's not going to do it [noise]\nUm so we'll see and you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know facts should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nYou know what I Want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption\nOf innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page a tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already\nDone with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the\nCase of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this\nWas enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in you know that we learned about this Ramirez and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people\nThey found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if\nIt was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly it\nThat that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in the\nCereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis what happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues\nOf the story that she just released a week a week\nPrior how does that become news and yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well they weren't exactly wind up\nIn the hall um while he was in ... no I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that yeah but the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident from Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe's police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone within a Supreme Court [noise]\nWhy we need and has the ins and because there are a lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating\nFrom around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test and he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly Avon no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this is all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said they were for people that could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point\nYou've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but by\nProfessor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that they're\nThey're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee\nUm you know it's just I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all that matters Lindsey Graham is saying Clintons sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the\nActually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves and we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way of solving a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office\nApparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by

an\nArmy of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and so we'll see what that means from his vantage point uh we also have

that is sort of the Sean Hannity show\nTwenty five now to the top of the hour as we continue from our nation's capital Washington DC\nSo at the FBI investigation now coming to and and and the Senate planning their vote and moving forward on all of this um the big question and with all the news today you\nKnow what do we see happening is in the next thirty four days what do we see happening you know five weeks from yesterday you're going to tune into TV and you're going to get results from a midterm election\nNow the left will either be happy because of the announcement Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house or Chuck Schumer is going to be the next Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will chair her committee impeach forty five reclaiming all the time she ever wanted\nAnd that's what's at stake in this election\nNow it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know it's ... if you go back forty nine percent of voters back the Democratic party forty two percent Republicans by the way I Can't remember elections were Republicans led and generic ballot just to give you some historical context\nBut in mid September it was fifty two thirty eight and I know Nancy Pelosi seems confident she's out there I'm going to be the next speaker\nWell you don't get to decide that it's actually in the hands of the American people\nNow we can't make you vote but we can only tell you what's going to happen if in fact the Democrats win\nAnd what's gonna happen is very basic fundamental and simple is they will have a list non stop investigations Kavanaugh gets through they want to impeach Kavanaugh they want to impeach the president they want to investigate all things president\nWhat do you think this Fifteen page expos they in the New York times is all about number one\nThey've they figure it out the Kavanaugh debate is over so now they're moving on to the next thing and that's the old reliable which is to smear slander you know bludgeon Donald Trump\nYou know well how many years ago that his father die that's how far back they want to go\nAnd so I I don't think it's gonna be the story people say but you know they don't have a vision for you they don't have a plan for you there's no discussion among any Democrat I ever see not one\nThat says this is what we're going to do to help improve the lives of the American people at the risk of being repetitive just bear with me for for thirty seconds\nObama had eight years Thirteen million more Americans food stamps eight million more poverty lowest labor participation rates in the seventies worst recovery since the forties\nLowest homeownership rate in fifty one years um he'd he'd literally took on more debt than all forty three presidents before him combined the only president in American history to never reach three percent GDP Growth\nIn a here and now the Trump McConnell me is is moving forward it was pretty interesting Hillary's favorite economist is now actually admitting that the Trump pecan of me is rip roaring hot that his name is mark Sandy predicted\nIn twenty six team that the Trump presidency would lead lead to an economic disaster\nHe's now saying it's rip roaring hot it was on CNBC so that's the eight years of Obama you want to go back to that are we better off as a country that we were two years ago do you want this agenda because it's not about you it's not about your family's it's not about your kids it's not about the future\nIt's all about power in stopping Trump by any means necessary and anybody associated with Trump by any means necessary getting their face chase them into gas stations and grocery stores\nAnd yell at you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi kick Sarah Sanders at a restaurant go after Ted Cruz kick him and his wife out of a restaurant you know Mitch McConnell can barely walk at his age he's an elderly man getting in his face in an airport\nThat's what they they're telling people to do Spartacus has been saying it Maxine Waters is saying it and by the way Obama has said it many times over the years even directly aimed at me but they want to impeach the president if Kavanaugh gets through then they want to impeach him\nEndless investigation Trump Trump Organization Trump taxes Trump this Trump that stormy stormy this one this one it's just never going to end\nThere there'll be no focus on oh and they want the crumbs back so you get the biggest tax cut in American history American families are are benefiting to the tune of ... the first real increase in real wages the American people got the first wage increase\nUm you know our we're the problem not the Islamic terrorists or Iran is our best friend you know Israel is our enemy we socialism even though it doesn't work and we can't afford it is something we want to embrace even though people are starving and dying and Venezuela\nWhenever the campus faculty lounge mentality tells the Democrats that that's what the Democrats embrace and that's it so I said they're all interchangeable at this point and if they were in some like\nJoe mansion or Joe Donnelly or someone will be standing up right now in in standing like that the guy in Tiananmen Square against the tank but they're not\nThey are very I I was a good friend of mine is a Democrat I won't give his name in Washington but he believes that this election cycles about taking control and experts in cycle won't run in primaries and getting rid of any Democrat who would be the least bit moderate up there\nAnd you can see that's what's

some some enthusiastic Tea Party groups trying to draft\nJust cookie primary candidates to try to primary out establishment Republicans and and inside our party we had people saying don't do that\nThat person's nuts or whatever it might be whether you agreed with them or disagreed with them we were able to criticize um any kind of attempt to purify or anything that got a little bit too over the rainbow that's what the ... and I think almost to a fault where we do that Democrats have no such compunction\nNone whatsoever Alexandria Ocasio Cortez cannot answer a question about how she wants to pay for a takeover the healthcare system and a universal basic income plan for all of America that's OK letter keep talking she's pretty and she's the face of the future\nYou know it doesn't

impeached Trump\nIs going to be the the bumper stickers that so that's how they're doing and it's how they have been doing it\nAnd and I think remains to be seen whether our team 'cause you're on our team and the Republicans are our team if she realizes that that they're playing dirty that they don't play by the rules and they're trying to draft an entire team of of thugs basically\nAnd they have so much money which is something else you have to remember when I got older\nYou spent five million or sold his hosts for five hundred dollars to come back and want to give me a nationwide ours is

PGA Tour winner in Wisconsin native Steve stricter or Wisconsin on her plate\nVoting for Kavanaugh he'll go vote for capital same probably with Heidi Heitkamp I'm Joe Donnelly already said no who knows if he changes his mind but he's on record saying he's not going to do it [noise]\nUm so we'll see and you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know facts should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nYou know what I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that\nObviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence\nThat is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page a tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance of covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already\nDone with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this and I think the American\nPeople have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with\nRemember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and\nFound out already that they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in you know\nThen we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people\nThey found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it\nWas him well that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had\nGaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event then the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as he said almost on a weekend basis what happened where young boys in these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident from Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight why he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualify for someone within a Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd eat and has the Haitian because there are a lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for\nExamination former boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the board\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating\nFrom around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test and he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly I've been no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look\nPutting if you like the dramatic shift in the economy it feel like the record setting unemployment numbers if you liked the fact that actual stuff is getting done at a at an unbelievable taste\nEspecially considering this is Washington you know it takes them an hour and thirty minutes to just think about brushing their teeth\nIt's they don't move and now you've got\nThe president literally altering shifting changing the way things have been done these breaking a lot of dishes and he's a disruptor and he's iconoclastic and he fights but when he fights against you know even allies negotiating trade deals we're benefiting\nAnd the forgotten men and women the people that matter the most two years ago they're all benefiting\nAnd I notice now Trump's lawyers say the allegations of fraud tax evasion they're now trying to dig up\nTax returns from the father how when did Donald Trump's father die was it two decades ago\nAt least maybe more\nAnd it's just that but I guess they figure the Kavanaugh issue is done and the Senate's going to vote whichever way they're going to vote so now we've got to move on to a new scandal\nAnd we can't exactly moved to stormy ... books than out so maybe we'll do Russia again that doesn't work we'll do taxes again maybe we'll have a big reveal on Rachel Maddow after forty minutes leading I got it paid fifty billion ... billion dollars in taxes [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] It's Wednesday October third what's new today on the free our radio as high\nAll the best play with cash stations tell him what happened was rocked up every ...

founder first field tech and owner Larry baby says there's someone's not comfortable shape are perfectly happy we're going to change that no matter what we have to do real caring that our customers can steal cars are comfort does the things you wish everyone would [noise]\nI'm Wayne owner Midwest engine serving your current affairs and you need a car we can help me service for for ... for Vicki guys Madison beside Milwaukee St from women in eighty nine\nAM and\n\nPretty\nSure the jacket as soon as you get to your car after work for breaking information you need to know about that is the Sean Hannity show\nTwenty five now till the top of the hour as we continue from our nation's capital Washington DC so at the FBI investigation now coming to and and and the Senate planning their vote and moving forward on all of this um the big question and with all the news today\nYou know what do we see happening is in the next thirty four days what do we see happening you know five weeks from yesterday you're going to tune into TV and you're going to get results from a midterm election\nNow the left will either be happy because of the announcement Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house or Chuck Schumer is going to be the next Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will chair her committee impeach forty five reclaiming all the time she ever wanted\nAnd that's what's at stake in this election\nNow it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know it's ... if you go back forty nine percent of voters back the Democratic party forty two percent Republicans by the way I Can't remember elections were Republicans led the generic ballot just to give you some historical context\nBut in mid September it was fifty two thirty eight and I know Nancy Pelosi seems competent she's out there I'm going to be the next speaker well you don't get to decide that it's actually in the hands of the American people\nNow we can't make you vote but we can only tell you what's going to happen if in fact the Democrats win\nAnd what's gonna happen is very basic fundamental and simple\nIs they will have a list non stop investigations Kavanaugh gets through they want to impeach Kavanaugh they want to impeach the president they want to investigate all things president what do you think this Fifteen page expos they in the New York times is all about number one\nThey've they figure it out the cabin on debate is over so now they're moving on to the next thing and that's the old reliable which is to smear slander you know bludgeon Donald Trump\nYou know ... how many years ago that his father die that's how far back they want to go\nAnd so I I don't think it's going to be the story people say but you know they don't have a vision for you they don't have a plan for you there's no discussion among any Democrat I ever see not one\nThat says this is what we're going to do to help improve the lives of the American people at the risk of being repetitive just bear with me for for thirty seconds\nObama had eight years Thirteen million more Americans food stamps eight million more poverty lowest labor participation rates in the seventies worst recovery since the forties\nLowest homeownership rate in fifty one years um he'd eat literally took on more debt than all forty three presidents before him combined the only president in American history to never reach three percent GDP Growth\nIn a year and now the Trump pecan enemy is is moving forward it was pretty interesting Hillary's favorite economist is now actually admitting that the Trump McConnell me is rip roaring hot guy's name is mark does handy predicted\nIn twenty sixteen that the Trump presidency would lead lead to an economic disaster\nHe's now saying it's rip roaring hot it was on CNBC so that's the eight years of Obama you want to go back to that are we better off as a country that we were two years ago do you want this agenda 'cause it's not about you it's not about your family's it's not about your kids it's not about the future\nIt's all about power in stopping Trump by any means necessary and anybody associated with Trump by any means necessary getting their face chase them into gas stations and grocery stores\nAnd yell at you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi kick Sarah Sanders at a restaurant go after Ted Cruz kick him and his wife out of a restaurant you know Mitch McConnell could barely walk at his age he's an elderly man getting in his face in an airport\nThat's what they they're telling people to do Spartacus has been saying it Maxine Waters is saying it it by the way Obama has said it many times over the years even directly aimed at me but they want to impeach the president if Kavanaugh gets through then they want to impeach him\nEndless investigation Trump Trump Organization Trump taxes\nTrump this Trump that stormy stormy this one this one it's just never going to end\nThere there'll be no focus on oh and they want the crumbs back so you get the biggest tax cut in American history American families are are benefiting to the tune of ... the first real increase in real wages the
