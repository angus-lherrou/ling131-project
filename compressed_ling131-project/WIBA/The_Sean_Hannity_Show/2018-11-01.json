[noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say do you\nSee I didn't either when I really can't I mean and I think now\nAnd and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that they can see below sea what when the house um that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is you know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but\nIt's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nKenny one who does not bode has effectively voted for him and she should be no one should kids themselves\nIf you do not want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase it tells you how crazy their party at\nHow how could you then again she was smart lady because she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services firm [noise] um she go down to less than you think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all he don't like them or a sister a I'm not going to not voting is in effect a half vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection and every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home\nOr you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you both for reticent in Tennessee you're you're voting for sure\nAnd I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote\nThat's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody when he won and to some of the claims or a moderate Democrat asked for the poor for a leader can I say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house all of course and went on from that she calls you know I sort of have to be that high defeat them there are a liberal 'cause they say\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I'm Jeff Cohen is the founder of ... group the retirement specialist I'm often asked what we mean when we say the Cold War way\nHad come on best per group we know that you sacrifice to build the life are the ones you love\nOur goal is to help you enjoy what's most important to spending time with family traveling and enjoying each day were offered a reminder that the most important things in life are things\nWe can help you enjoy the blessings of life free of worries about money we always actors producers with your best interests in mind that took a long way when you were seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more retirement that\nSays you know that every decision matters in your past retirement make one more smart decision called ... desperate group at eight seven seven five six zero forty forty or visit the ... way dot com today just\nCall those guys are offering securities ... natal services ... advisory services through arguing of his advisors like call of this group of veterans to broker dealer and is independent ... angel services\nFast enough to pull down way register online and only ... minutes\nFrom my family county board of elections like salmon sat on the right to repair mine is I don't mind warm hope I now pass on with him seven\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid plans in Virginia in helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's go family care dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health\n\nInto this show one time and your hand and dies Sean Hannity is back on the radio\nBy twenty five now to the top of the hour new getting rich is with us well we just played for him let's see Joe Scarborough Trump's immigration fear mongering like the Nazis with the gypsies et cetera et cetera uh Don Lemon biggest terrorist threat in the country is white men radicalized that the right\nAh Alison ...

really comment on was launched and that is the killer at the sooner go crazy or what was in fact deeply viciously anti Trump is not a pro Trump at all I suggest any parallel between ... and it's just

better way to describe them and just being you know\nAgainst the people they're not necessarily ends with people but many of them frankly I Believe our enemies of the survival of Americans we've known

there is now a movement that has evolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats are extinct it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nWith two totally different America you know there there are Americans one in which we don't teach American history we don't look at the American I'm not proud of the flight motion so you could count on emotional either the star Spangled Banner\nA and you know we're just one more normal country there ought to be subordinate to the un and crashed\nOrange County and found that Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this was a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm Ken ...\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear or do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on the after the the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seen this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and\nI don't know people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job of the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the ... that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly get a new set a it is getting\nMore and more for double to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back [noise] and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOf the problems that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois\nThe Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them and you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy our first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is was Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California\nThese races all will tip the balance of power and if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nNot fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and\nWhat was done a thing for upstate New York and the fact that Pennsylvania takes all of the natural gas from New York and they are allowed to frack and you see the economy booming and the other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and then\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago the matter of fact it was five years ago today on the health care as a situation because when they rolled out before\nTo ... became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I have extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's hats that I've had 'em\nThat are no longer covered and yesterday I had to sit down

need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care well\nI've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody those now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to know I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep their plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lies ever told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in upstate New York would get the prosperity that they deserve it can be done to instantaneously if
