Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nSo he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons so it was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get Ani called them the blue collar billionaire and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was gay he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started died you know\nSean Sean list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration and America is about passing the ... the\nThe baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating market incentive policies\nOf because what we both know is it you cannot just ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcome should never happens black markets crop up\nAnd then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else just devastated by their Cuba or Venezuela like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this was all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here\nBut there's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen and you've got to suppress the voices of the other people\nIt's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling I'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it but the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the malarkey yeah\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of those Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed

father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in a book about how well the mean horrible landlords\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually carry won a family in thirty forty your friends and stuff and I wanted to relate that story you know an auto it quickly\nAfraid

building these buildings helping to fill the buildings are collecting rent from blue collar people that were living shot so\nSo I wanted I did a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success in many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America the part of that broke up America\nYou know the the generations that built this country that none of Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I

[laughter] I ran for the state house in the Senate in Arizona\nHere since I was in the spring and fall\nMy mind to make Sally and I approve this message\nI we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour a that was an ad put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero\nAnd her background or experience is pretty unbelievable here also watching an Arizona this caravan are headed right towards our southern border has become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back I'm\nKristin cinema once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake\nYeah that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America um she's had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha mix Sally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked be asked to stay at home moms ... off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home leech off their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think Martha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one I had you up by seven when I grew up by two uh but uh I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nThan well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and your extremism on so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are are turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there\nThere is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona value than American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a a a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to me serving twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolutely honored my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse than send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the ... nearly died\nA Sean when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include your troops will I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there was a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nA that stuff is just been sitting around somewhere on watched because nobody has a Supreme projector anymore or beta maximum VHS\nTape player so what do you do what the stuff you want to see it you think you know what's on there but you can't possibly remember every photo or every family home movie that's out there\nAnd you'd love to see them again and now you can and the only thing keeping you from seeing it is the equipment to watch them well there's a company that makes all of this possible now it's called legacy box they have made memories come alive again for more than four hundred thousand families\nThey have the gear rows and rows\nVCR machines every imaginable film projector legacy box transfers everything to a digital format for you in just a couple of weeks time and they do at high speed high speed is necessary to preserve the best quality possible\nThey've got equipment you couldn't get too expensive they can make these high speed transfers maintaining the original quality or quality put it on a series of DVDs or thumb drives however you want it so now your family members\nAre immediately visible you'll get to see them again and you can share of and you can copy them once you get them back\nWith everybody that would like to see them\nYou have a lot of bacon I got a copy of that I mean people are going to see things from the family way back when that nobody has seen in a long time it's such a great service and it is so efficient you start by going online the legacy box dot com slash rush\nYou do that you'll get forty percent off the planet you choose they will ship you a\nSpecially made box that shields from different kinds of raised that might destroy the contents you put all that stuff in the box send it to them they transfer it and send it all back to you they keep you advised of the progress takes about two weeks and you're done legacy box dot com slash rush is the website\nAnd again forty percent off ramp audio soundbite number seven\nThis was last night on Hannity he had the mortgage on\nAnthony scar most you know this guy is in crisis Scaramucci could pass for Eighteen years old except that he's not he's got one of these internally youthful appearance is is a former White House communications director for Trump for about eight team days\nAnd he remains you got a new book out\nUm and it's it's I forgot the title of it but he's making his rounds he wasn't Hannity last night and Hannity said why did the Democrats even have a shot in Fifteen days and it's a question a lot of people who in the world would vote for Democrats why wouldn't you both for anybody\nThat is promising to wipe out all the progress why would you vote for any party that wants to literally shut down the progress and here's what the more ... had to say it's\nBecause of the media probably Sean I mean I think that could be one of the main reasons most people predicted that the house and so forth goes to the other side but the president is demonstrating that he can get the voter turnout even in a midterm election and so I think somebody very close\nI mean you're not going to be surprised to our friends are not going to be surprised Rush Limbaugh is not going to be surprised\nIf the Democrats um don't win or don't ...\nYeah it gets you know again conflicting news if you missed the beginning of the program there there's I'm Charlie Cook\nWho is the inside the beltway go through and analyze in predicting the outcome of the\nOff year election wrote in election and then you have the um [noise] what was it oh yeah Nate Silver eighty five percent chance of Democrats when the house and cook has identified any more seats tending democratic I don't I don't know how many are left to go democratic last I looked\nThese guys had two hundred nine seats leaning Democrat\nI mean [noise] practically over and yet NBC has a poll out showing that early voting and enthusiasm\nRepublicans are dwarfing Democrats in early vote that never happens\nJoe Biden and Obama can't draw flies today rallies they're having for democratic candidates and Trump can't get a venue big enough to let everybody in so it's confusing I myself again state I Will not be surprised if this blue wave doesn't materialize to be anything\nAnd that's what I handed off for the next guy\nBut I did [noise] so when you talk about [laughter]\nIt goes right now it's me from\nThe Trump better as you can just make stuff up [noise] you know that's one thing you learn from the United states and get cold and dark out\nGet called the new account well we know is record eight years\nThirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty lowest labor participation rates in the seventies worst recovery since the forties lowest homeownership rate in fifty one years the only president in American history never to reach three percent GDP Growth than a year\nThey only won any accumulated more debt than all forty three presidents before him combine a\nFax or very stubborn things Mr President but are you better off than you were two years ago well the fourteen states that now have record low unemployment I think I Would say decide decisively yes\nOr or record low record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets and youth unemployment all setting record low numbers\nThat's great for the American people we have\nBetter trade deals than we've ever had were paying less abroad than we paid before because the president's negotiating even with NATO even with Western European countries we have a much better deal the benefits are farmers for one or dairy guys for too\nI'm In Wisconsin and Michigan and elsewhere\nThe the manufacturing jobs that Obama said would never coming back now starting to come back four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest number in Thirty years just under President Trump not under Obama\nA better trade deals with Canada with Mexico abroad Israel now we've Jerusalem is now their capital how many presidents like Obama promised that never delivered when not dropping cash loads plane loads cargo planes full of cash\nAnd other currencies on the runways mullahs that hate us and little rocket man\nYou know fire and fury and my button is bigger than yours is not firing rockets over Japan every other day and the president didn't pay a penny to get back our hostages number one didn't pay a penny to get back the remains of Americans that have been there since Nineteen fifty three or four or whatever it is\nAnd still gets criticized and all of this under the cloud of a phony you know conspiracy theory that is now the bones to basically at this point Trump Russia collusion\nWell that's coming to an end to end in fourteen days you'll decide if Nancy Pelosi gets the gamble back you'll decide if it Maxine\nWaters is ahead of her committee and Adam Schiff the liar is the head of his committee\nAnd Gerald ... is the head of his committee and nonstop investigation impossible impeachment and higher taxes because they want their crumbs back we know they want open borders eliminate ice sanctuary city states they want to sanctuary country\nNot one Democrat has talked about this caravan now literally exploding in size\nYou know to fourteen thousand people strong what are we going to do if they get to our board of water Democrats offering whereas there call because I can play the Democrats and I'll do it later in the program I can play them all sounding like Donald Trump during the Obama years\nOnly now they won't open borders because they think it benefits them politically although that's now backfired to the point where John Podesta sending out memos\nWith the center for American Progress they don't\nTalk about that don't talk about immigration Maxine stopped talking about impeaching forty five I Would say if I had to guess that my best\nAfter all this study and that I Do every single day and all the polls I look at every day I don't have a feel for which way the house is\nGoing to go I think it's hanging in the balance to be honest we've identified fifty specific racist I won't name them all because it'll take too much airtime\nAnd we made it easy for you we put an interactive map on Hannity dot com the fifty house races that will tip the balance of power in the house of representatives now on the Senate side look is very tight and Florida there's no other way to describe it\nFlorida's always title unfortunately but you've got Rick Scott who's looking to unseat a Nelson\nAs the you know basically the Schumer of Florida and Rick Scott things done a great job in the state of Florida as a governor and you've got the mister tax and spend is also an article did you see all these articles about the\nThe eye and an investigations into Gillum and who is getting it's getting interesting in that case a but there's a lot out there about him in a Tampa Bay times shows that records show FBI agents gave Andrew Gillum tickets to Hamilton and twenty sixteen isn't that nice\nYeah well he's got ... investigations of him going on and he wants to forty percent tax for the people of Florida\nIt will destroy the economy of Florida so I don't know which way Florida is going to go\nI'm pretty confident after British sit and his team of been exposed as frauds that think that the people of Tennessee are ignorant\nI'm pretty sure that's not going over well with the people of Tennessee that I Know and I live Ninety miles or Ninety minutes south of of Nashville for a couple of years of my life used to go up there all the time I Love music city usa\nBut I'm thinking Marsha Blackburn is going to hold that seat I'm pretty confident that the people of Missouri or a little sick and tired of\nOf clear Schumer McCaskill because she's a reliable hundred percent vote for sure every time and they're probably sick and tired of the fact that she too in her office to got caught on tape they're lying to the people of Missouri bragging behind the scenes how she's just like Obama\nI'm pretty sure that Heidi Heitkamp mean is done in North Dakota I mean do you see that she recently released into the name of a sexual assault victims trying to\nYou know in an ad that she's running anyway we've never seen a mid term race like that before and I'm pretty sure listen I think if the people in Nevada to get out you can save Dean Heller he's up a little bit in the polls but that's always a tight state for Republicans you got to have to get out there and vote\nI saw a buddy Tarkanian as a kid is running out there is a great guy I'm so and I'm pretty sure that you know cinema in Arizona I mean it is there anything else she wants to say about how horrible the people she's asking to vote for our\nMeth capital of democracy you know and fighting radical speakers that that represent the blind shake that were accused of actually you know passing on his messages to other crazy people that don't like this country\nAnd then of course ah oh it's okay to join the Taliban saying that to Martha McSally twenty eight years of military service six deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan that should be a very easy decision for the people in Missouri\nPeople in Montana now for the first time have a choice running in Indiana would win outright if it wasn't but those libertarian don't waste your boat in Indiana for the libertarian candidate and I listened with all due respect I don't know the person\nBut all they're doing his ticket splitting all they're doing is typing all votes from around the Republican and lessening the chances that in fact Joe Donnelly can be removed from and another it's basically Joe Schumer Donnelly what's the I'm going to tell you all these races Southern California believe it\nOr not it's going to play a big role in the in the balance of power in the house Minnesota's going to play a big role in the balance of power in the house Michigan's going to play a big role Ohio is going to play a big role Warren is going to play a big role\nEvery state in the union I mean there's listen if Nate Silver saying eighty six percent and he looks so bad after the last election now part of this I always believe is to deflate enthusiasm on our side you don't have to listen to the pollsters I don't listen to the pollsters\nLast uh last November or twenty sixteen in November of five Fifteen I got the exit polls\nThose exit poll showed that Donald Trump didn't win a single state\nHe lost Florida lost Ohio he lost North Carolina he lost ... lost Wisconsin you lost Pennsylvania\nAnd he may have lost like every other red state that's what the poll showed the same thing in two thousand and four John Kerry the exit polls by Fifteen eastern time on election day in ... for John Kerry was going to be the next president so these polls these calculations they're basically somebody else's best gas\nSo don't take any of the Senate races for granted where we think we're ahead and don't take the fact that\nYou know Nancy Pelosi is picking out the drapes and looking for a new gamble and Maxine Waters is all excited and Gerald ... Adam Schiff are excited\nBecause you have the power to shock the world you get to decide that's the beauty here some states like Texas started yesterday Florida has it now early voting is started ... you can both ... right now you can vote tomorrow you can do it any day you want go vote\nI vote on election day it's an old habit I have a vote on election they're not that my vote matters but I'm going out for my local congressman and that's it Andrew Cuomo is going to win I Can't help that in New York is up by twenty nine points so you know you focus on where you can law will say in New Jersey Melendez is in trouble\nGreen will how\nKind capable of caregivers you're doing who know how to handle the tough mom and a half\nI'm telling you didn't care when you don't know where to turn\n... so how the shoe box or black or has the best selection of right wing boots tough record company made in the usa oh\nTitus who role on Sean Hannity's show project beret top strikes again first they caught\nBrightest in the news team purposely thinking that they can lie to the people Tennessee and they did the same thing with Claire McCaskill and her team now we will exclusively break tonight nine eastern a video as it relates to Heidi Heitkamp\nWell actually I'm not saying that uh a prominent North Dakota law maker that'll rock the mid term elections you know it's amazing what these tapes are showing it showing Democrats cannot be honest with who they are\nWhat they believe what they will support what they will do and they are with contempt and hatred\nTheir teams them in their teams are behind the scenes thinking the people that vote for them are ignorant\nThinking that they can be manipulated and that they're just saying things to get elected that would be reticent in Tennessee that's McCaskill in Missouri that's Kristin cinema in Arizona\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and by the way they're just the ones that got caught\nWhat you know think of what I think of what Democrats have said a Peter structure I we can smell the smelly Walmart voters in a what a what a Joe Biden said recently about Trump voters about number of these people are the drag this society and then Obama bitter people\nIn Pennsylvania the quaint to their God guns and religion and of course there's the era deem about the horrible comments Hillary and much more\n...

twenty\nFive 'til the top of the hour or two weeks from today election day we have a new poll out Minnesota Public radio showing Republican Doug ward low is now leading Democrat Keith Ellison by seven points in the race for the attorney general of Minnesota\nWanting to the uh Minnesota Public radio star Tribune Minnesota pole\nAnd it's now forty three thirty six in that particular race\nAnd um what's fascinating about this is I didn't hear\nYou know all the people that wanted all the investigations into judge Kavanaugh based on you know guilt by accusation no due process no presumption of innocence not a word from any of the\nNo ... no Dianne Feinstein or no Corey Spartacus Booker and no Kamala Harris fascinating Kamala Harris Wu's Iowa I you know what I see they're trying to turn to mellow or Cory into the the next Obama next\nIf you're on the Democratic party the next anointed one it is dying to find the right person OK well given your best shot\nAt the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue as they said they did well then Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am never mind what he had already admitted he did on his own\nOn top of Keith Ellison he would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of its true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman Monaghan who recently dated Keith Ellison it was his girlfriend she's got tapes and and doctors' notes and\nAnd uh apparently some maybe even video of him a verbally physically emotionally abusing this woman\nHow people uh Minnesota are paying attention if not you know all these hypocrites on the Senate Judiciary committee\nOr the wave our friend Dana Rohrabacher Southern California it's six congressional races that are going to play a big part\nIn the balance of power come November two weeks from now and then come January Dana Rohrabacher apparently was tied but now it's taken a lead in in his important seat which is California's forty eighth congressional district\nIs a friend of the program and uh that but there's the tight race\nUm anecdotally are not paying a lot of attention to it but then BBC News is reporting of early voting results are any indication we may be seeing a bigger\nRepublican turnout than anybody anticipated oh jeez oppose might be wrong again\nI just don't trust these polls I don't trust these people that make their predictions\nYou know I follow I I look at it I factor it into what my thinking is I actually think that we should act right now that every race every Republican is behind\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for polo see staying home is a half a vote for below sea\nAnd in every important Senate race be at Florida or be a Tennessee or be Missouri or bit Nevada or be at Arizona or Montana or North Dakota or New Jersey even or Indiana that they're all winnable\nNo there's no scenario that would unfold one week two weeks from tonight that I could be surprised that\nBut I Would like to shock the world again I Would like you to shock the world

earth is warming slowly [laughter]\nAh but not nearly all of them agree it's warming rapidly a few extreme activists think it's warming rapidly but they can't find any of the warming [noise]\nOkay [noise] which is causing the climate change and that these negative effects on the earth's natural system and human civilization already being seen and measured\nBut you can't find the warming\nSo if you can't find the warming then what are the effects on earth's natural systems and human civilization what are you seeing and measuring\nThey're less storms fewer hurricanes the hurricanes that we do see are actually less intense despite the last one that we had\nFewer tornadoes here extreme weather patterns\nSo what are the what ... what are these um negative effects from the warming you can find the major contributor to carbon dioxide is human activity no\nThat's actually not the major contributor to carbon dioxide the major contributor to carbon dioxide are natural sources bowl like volcanoes and other kinds of natural things that happened irrespective of human activity\nOkay so three things stated in the first two sentences here um that actually ought to be corrected\nThe continued use of fossil fuels is being supported by a market sale year whereby the cost of carbon emissions are not included in the price of fossil fuels\nHuh [noise] so you're saying that dense sources that are abundant that allow us to produce the energy we need to live a modern first world existence or not\nIncluded in the market value of fossil fuels\n\nExcept they are\nThe value of fossil fuels is the market value of fossil fuels of course there's some government intervention here and there but generally speaking the market value of fossil fuels as the market value of fossil fuels you know we know this because fossil fuels\nAre not subsidized solar and wind are heavily subsidized nuclear is somewhat subsidized oil and gas have virtually no subsidies per megawatt

board for cry the urgent need to ... transition away from fossil fuels ... urges\nWhy\nCan best be accomplished with a quote market based program namely a revenue neutral carbon fee\nOn fossil fuel producers you see here's the problem it's not revenue neutral it's just a gigantic tax oh this is a carbon tax is what they're calling for\nThey say\nCorresponding rebates are dividends an equal amounts to American household to offset increase energy costs okay\nBut there will be a dividend paid\nTo offset the increase energy costs to make carbon tax because the carbon tax will deplete economic output\nDo you get the\nThat's the problem\nWith the carbon tax is described as some kind of revenue neutral there'll be a Democrat in but there is to do it and we actually have countries that have done this Germany is done this Australian did this\nThere is no such thing as the rebate or a dead end paid it's just pure\nTax\nUsing a revenue neutral carbon fee I notice that they're calling it the not tanks 'cause they think people like that better and and the evidence that is non existent to reduce carbon emissions what happened following fits the carbon the would provide an incentive for the development and use of energy efficiency and low carbon energy sources\nEnergy efficiency is its own\nMotivator it's its own incentive [laughter] that's why companies\nContinually

the these Democrats and called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of it is true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman Monaghan who recently data Keith Ellison it was his

Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for a pillow see staying home with a half a vote for below sea\nAnd in every important Senate race be at Florida or being Tennessee or be at Missouri or be Nevada or be at Arizona or Montana or North Dakota or New Jersey even or Indiana\nThat they're all winnable\nYou know there's no scenario would unfold one week two weeks from tonight that I could
