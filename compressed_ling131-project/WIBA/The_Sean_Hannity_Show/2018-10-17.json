Kelly\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we release the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by bumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces when this guy Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we are going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it and that's the that's the ... it's that this is the other guy next arose field organizer tells us\nHe says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views no I confronted Nick on the street yesterday with the microphone to Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposed\nAnd you don't want no one's gonna say agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win and ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I see the everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's who they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery was the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is honest because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's going to be very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week British and talk to local media this is a Tennessee Senate candidate he told all the local media stations\nWell you know these these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffer said well they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing he said well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologize\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and a lot of this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing um you know the one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in this video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he said semi automatic rifles\nThis is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so we're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nI again I think that you're rocking the world the big state Senate candidates and exposing them for who they really are look\nI've been saying and explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that help them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice\nThey're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes I think exposed what's going on in every congressional and Senate district\nExcept you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people are already\nWe've got we've gotten request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have got more nations if ice but they're you know it's people are already early voting and some of these states and that is that the bigger issue is like I said the last week or the few days ago\nAbout don't lie to the people I ask this guy next to roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to lie why why is our politics so broken that that becomes a condition to having to win the honest because voters aren't going to end in Tennessee this guy just lost\nThere's a new poll out New York times poll and he's down fourteen points after video it doesn't help you when\nPeople find that stuff out but some of these senators John only going to run for one term so they say like Heidi Heitkamp\nWas ... ... yeah they said well I mean that's the point the lie to get the one term and I say right there James O'Keefe ah project Vera times dot com you can see the videos we've linked it on Hannity dot com\nUm and the big question I'm going to ask him when we get back is is they're going to be more\nUm when we come back to the bottom of the have are we going to compare the Obamacare Iraq versus direct primary care and what is the answer to the to the big problem um health care and we're going to look at the the media corruption as it relates to\nThey don't even want to talk about Stormy Daniels ... anymore because stormy lost and has to pay the court costs and the lawyer legal fees of Donald Trump nobody's reporting it quick break we'll come back we'll continue with James O'Keefe\nNow that I'm going to have them building maybe we can get back to bringing jobs ... jobs Jay oh this is Sean Hannity show [noise]\n\nAnd not to mention the ...

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big\nRedistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ...\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much a Ford or\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine and a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nIt's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr Lee as grows president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing in I Would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patients to [laughter]\nFailed you'll have a lot of them too right\nWe we have a you know a room and over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it [noise]\n[noise] well I mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well or which has happened occasionally in my life\nAnd these guys you know I ... I mean I pay them and they take my insurance is but they do it as more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely yeah\nAt tech spleen how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nOr Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headaches a hassle the middleman so that now medicines are penny a pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI told this is now they implement how many places did you get this finely\nUp and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail on up here explain exactly what the service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and it's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits offices\nSo it's a free tale of medicine so you can call ... ... email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do it in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesome medications in labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist and say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\n[noise] yeah it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there to try to tick down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to helped hurt it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans walk their healthcare chosen diagnose Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through rhetoric primary care relationship\nWere not as we leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and\nYou know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan\nNow if the average California is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if\nYou're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state it was my prediction but\nIf people want to experiment with is that you know ... what am I I'm not there to tell people\nHad it on the banking account I Can't afford to pay taxes on it yeah\nI mean it's unbelievable look I why you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire California is all going in Texas\nYou know ... what a Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and laugh might do the same thing a Texas\nUnbelievable which is what the beta war has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway do you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done in

I'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it but her she literally personally change herself to\nMinority status when U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry it and that was the turning point right when they when they came out and said\nThis is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals proof\nOf Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are ready at Trump rallies and twenty Twenty one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah it gets hurt him to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters\nSays they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed and and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that

everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point they have no message like they had no messaging twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't\nRemember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that she jobs coming back and companies coming back at less they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now\nHe's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with I'm not sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nAlways tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at these other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate\nYeah and and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state tendency red standing\nBeside the weight set it up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better work out more money than any cat on my gosh they're eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so\nThe Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats went back out and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty ... terms I have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep the house and if that happens\nAfter all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we have seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because they're saying it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some hackers on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nMob not allowed to say the word mob or I'd stay right there will continue Joe ...\nHe is the media reporter on the hill a will come back also the stormy stormy networks are a little bit quiet

right look shutting the reason that caught was that was known your program yet they find the delivery Clinton's speech\nAnd in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility in this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion\nJust telling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up is still a Democrat\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand since the day Donald Trump won the left in this country\nThose quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them you know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOf ... it is either they're not telling Maxine Waters ... said they keep telling me not to say it then you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because then you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian ... to ... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives this is who they are there's nothing that they're running on the tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create

just I cannot imagine\nFor a second that sentiment can win this race at this point\nSo the Senate is looking good you know my hope is is that three weeks from today when the results are in and we're looking at them I'll be able to say the Republicans have held on to the house because you got up and voted\nAnd you made sure that Nancy Pelosi didn't become the speaker to stop the progress that we have made which is significant\nIn the past two years we now have instead of Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps under Obama eight million more in poverty and no president ever went\nOh an attire presidents ... eight years without a single year three percent GDP Growth\nWell I Hope you're going to support the for a million new jobs we've had since Trump's elected eight million out of poverty and often food stamps and these elected four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest tax cut in history\nThe the greatest amount of deregulation we've ever seen in in five generations in this country including literally now putting in position and place an explosion of American energy independence\nYou know by allowing coal money to continue in West Virginia or Kentucky and and

every dollar and now they're the president say they need to step up and pay their fair share well now they're doing it\nAnd similarly Western European countries that have been unfair with us trade wise well if you don't say that you're gonna have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate\nAnd the fear the tariff is cause the mall to negotiate that means more jobs at home look at you know look at the the the new deal with a Canada Mexico\nThat helps American workers in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania you know bringing back manufacturing look what it's done to the steel industry which just seeing a revitalization thank God jobs that are never coming back four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs all coming back\nWhy because the president negotiate it you
