wants to get done in\nWell let's talk about that or bought one proposal and the fact that she you know they are\nI think that what you're proposing our restrictive and we want people to have more choices imagine senator Baldwin if you had a son or daughter and they wanted to get off your insurance and they're healthy and they want to stand on their own make it on their own\nAnd they can't do that under the proposal that you have they don't want to bankrupt their parents if they have one major catastrophic accent they can't afford\nRight now the Affordable CARE Act and so this is an option for them to have a healthy\nCoverage for themselves that doesn't have all the bells and whistles you want everybody to have the same thing that people have different needs we need to create a market

when you don't want her that you want to one side and the last ...\nLet's move on to move at all like that do response and it was ... next question okay [noise]\nWe're going to stay with health care right now but we are going to turn the topic to preexisting medical conditions\n... marriage is set in the first debate that was held quote I Would fall in front of a truck before I Would let people go without coverage for preexisting conditions\nYou do want to repeal the Affordable CARE Act and returns for those high risk pools available before if you went into effect on the Kaiser Family foundation says those costly high risk pools worked for about twenty five thousand Wisconsin I\nCould afford insurance and it is estimated that about eight hundred and fifty two thousand people in the states have pre existing conditions if a ca went away tomorrow how would they get coverage and how would it be funded [noise]\nWell this is a lie that thing perpetuate at all across the country against every Republican candidate the left to glom onto this as their issue the fact of the matter is\nThat the for Obamacare went into place\nFederal law said that if you're on Medicare Medicaid or private insurance coverage for preexisting conditions I said it before and I will say it again I Will fall in front of a truck before I let people with preexisting condition go without coverage we know how to take care of people with preexisting conditions\nIt can be done a fact of the matter is what senator Baldwin is proposing her plan is going to make it almost impossible for people\nTo receive the care that they want imagine if you don't have private insurance and your that person who has a rare lung disease you're not able to see your special Dr ... senator Baldwin wants us to do to be on a plan where you put somebody at risk like that or let's\nSay you need a hip replacement or you want any replacement that\nConsidered elective surgery we have seen this happen in Canada and England\nPeople wait twelve hours an emergency room they wait two months from onset of diagnosis of cancer breast cancer imagine one before treatment and this is it's\nSome of senator Baldwin would put us and I don't want that that is not good quality health care that it's not what we're used to giving to people in our own ... percent them now and I refused to now ...\nThank you I'm so\nGlad that you're focusing in on preexisting conditions it's actually the issue that brought me into a public life to begin with\nWhen I was a child I was very sick in the hospital for a month and afterwards my grandparents had a real struggle finding me insurance because I was labeled as that child with a preexisting condition\nAnd it has been my life's work to fight to make sure that Americans have access to affordable quality health care regardless of pre existing condition or other factors that we don't have an age tax for people over fifty\nUm all of these things and many more were incorporated when he finally passed the Affordable CARE Act\nWould have voted against it and fat and says\nTo the feed it went down by one vote\nAnd she has said that she would be the deciding vote if she were elected the United States Senate I really think this goes down to the choice of are we going to go forward or are we going to go backwards you talked about the uh her program I'm very expensive a six month wait if he had preexisting conditions\nThere were still a lifetime caps and only about one percent of Wisconsin ice with preexisting conditions ever enrolls\nSame as a problem with the junk plans about one in five people as rejected when they apply for that insurance and how can you have a choice of doctors if your insurance when even cover the ...\nThank you for the next question so to Jeff Taylor the W. W. TV\nLike Joe rooted in England\nBaltimore's on my work Facebook page what topics they look to the coverage tonight is much surprise more requested marijuana legalization than any other subject\nSo here's the question [noise] more\nA dozen Wisconsin counties including the one area and right now marathon marijuana legalization related ... random question on the November six about\nIn August Marquette University law school pay as Wisconsin residents where we stood on the issue is found sixty one percent of registered voters favor legalization with regulations attuned to those on alcohol\nWould you support at least changing marijuana from a schedule one drug highly addictive drug with no medical value soared scheduled to drug\nAddictive but having some medical bell you there for opening it up to at least researching marijuana for medical use and I believe this is for news ...\nActually senator balls and strikes on her mind and then middle novels if there was going to respond\nWell I appreciate that question and that so she actually does come up more than most people would realize at the federal level but let me start with where I Would be on those referenda I haven't seen all of them\nBut I Believe that I Would be a if a I think there is one on my ballot at home and I will be supporting it ah here's the problem with the schedule one\nA designation when something is deemed to have no medical value than there is no public funded research so we don't know the facts\nExcept for what has been discovered through research in other countries or what ever private a privately funded research has been done and that's a problem because we need to know if this has an effect of alternative to other drugs for glaucoma or for wasting syndrome or for 'em\nOr any number of other conditions how about an alternative treatment of pain that's less uh uh addictive than opioids to have killed so many people in this country [noise] um but we also have other issues in the federal government\nIn states now where it is legal to use marijuana for medicinal purposes\nFederally employed doctors can't discuss that with their patients that's a problem a doctor should have free rein to talk about all options with our patients and so we have more I'm certainly more work to do in this area uh of relieving pain\nThan under ... your time is up and your refund sense of\nYes well thank you very much I firmly believe that this is an issue that should be settled at the state level\nAnd I have very serious concerns about legalization of marijuana\nAnd people know that I have said that I look at\nMarijuana and the fact that it is a schedule one drug which we know means there are no medical indications for a few and therefore I Believe it is very concerning that senator ball when would be willing to open this up you know the drug the\nDepartment of drug enforcement at education has said that marijuana is\nHighly addictive even more addictive than bike it in and math and other drug\nA Syria heroin and opioid addiction problem in our state and in our country\nAnd a problem that senator Baldwin avoid it at our home a VA and I got to tell you\nI don't want to put us in a situation where we are now contributing to that and making the problem worse the governor of Colorado democratic governor has warned\nHas said the the where the careful before you go down this road also and the nurse I look at this from the perspective of the research I seen on the brain development of our young people I Am very concerned that if we start going down this road where we make this legal what is going to happen to our young people\nI'm not willing to take that risk much more time in his native I Need to see what happens\nIn states like Colorado and now we're going to go over to our social media desk was highly children and she has a question for humans Will Smith\nThank you Joe good evening ladies a lot of people on social media wanted me to ask about climate change a report released earlier this month by the United nations' scientific panel on climate change says the consequences of climate change are more immediate than previously thought\nNo one has shown us that she hasn't interested in doing that you know there is a far more serious case of me too movement in the neighboring state of Minnesota\nThe attorney general Kennedy Keith Ellison\nAnd send her ball went out only stands with him she has it been endorsed by him or has endorsed him and here's a case where the human person or the or the woman who um has put the allegation forward has Syria reports medical report showing the\nExtent to which she was allegedly allegedly victims\nAnd beaten up by her boyfriend\nSo in that case a serious me too\nAnd senator ball when you're there but you could not be there for judge Kavanaugh I'm if I'm an opportunity for his mom\nYour time is up and now an opportunity to respond set it up all the\n[noise] clearly clean up a bit here later is flying again and first of all the way you make an appointment\nWith the nominee is to go through the nominated her which is the White House\nI Am among dozens\nOf senators who are denied the chance to meet with him I don't know if they're going into a protection mode but that is the truth [noise]\nUm and we certainly has documentary evidence of south\nHave the best voting attendance record in the entire Senate and house delegation at Ninety nine per se a point six percent for that to note that\nBut er about you're hearing\nBy the panel the questions are very padded I just said I said\nNot showing up to seven out of ten opioid taskforce herrings a that is the record of my opponent we overlook near [noise]\nI Want to get to the question here um there's lots of reasons people don't speak up\nSome don't believe that there'll be listened to\nSome don't believe they'll be believed [noise]\nDr Blass Z Ford came forward\nWhen ... lost to herself and her family she has been threatened but she thought it was her civic duty\nBut we have to create an environment in a world where people can do that why did some of the victims and um the Catholic Church take decades to speak out why did Dennis Hastert victims take decades to speak up and it doesn't have to be corroborate ... people need to thank\nYou and now we're going to move over to how we\nStill think you ladies let's talk about abortion specifically roe v Wade\nSays the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh there's been more conversation on social media and elsewhere on what would happen if roe v Wade were over her\nAccording to a July poll from NBC News and the wall Street Journal Seventy one percent of Americans do not want it overturned including fifty two percent of Republicans as\nMuch as it is what would be your next move especially for women who are left with no legal means for an abortion\nCenter of all when this is your question first yes well\nI support roe versus Wade\nI Am pro choice and I believe that a woman should have the right to control her own body and make her own medical choices that I don't believe that this is an area where governments Orleans look there should intervene [noise]\nAh my opponents positions on this have not only been supporting the overturning roe versus Wade but well beyond that uh measures that would ban in vitro fertilization by which many couples who desperately want children have been able to conceive\nIt would include vanishing stem cell research that has created promising treatments ensures for people who need it [noise] um it would ban\nA access to abortion in all circumstances including rape and incest\nRemains in the state of Wisconsin is that there was no repeal ever\nOf the laws that existed before roe versus Wade was decided\nSo immediately in the state of Wisconsin [noise]\nA situation where doctors couldn't be arrested\nWould sadly probably begin to lose their lives again\nThe right to\nA safe and legal abortion were taken away\nI strongly believe\nThat we need to fight another black women's health choices\nYou're out of time and again by moderators options the question was what would you do\nIf roe v Wade were overturn\nAnd how does your thirty seconds to respond okay what would you do [noise]\nCertainly I Would try to pass laws that would protect\nA woman's right to control her own body\nBut the immediate impact is actually a state level impact and I'm In the United States Senate so at the federal level\nI Would certainly pressed to um\nReinstate it by legislation\nWomen depending on what state they live and would be in jeopardy of not\nNo longer being able to control their bodies\nSo thank you and now for a response to a ... and again the question was what would you do after\nRoe v Wade would be overturned\nClimate nurse and I as a nurse and one hundred percent pro life\nI Can't imagine not being pro life and senator Baldwin wants to talk about stream and she also wants to make up all kinds of things about [noise] different pieces of legislation that I suppose really support or don't support uh again [noise]\nExtreme to me senator Baldwin is supporting partial birth abortion [noise]\nI've said this to before I don't even know how you put your head on your pillow at night knowing that you support the most is fixable\nOf pulling a baby out of the mother's womb limb by limb sucking the brain out crushing Saul most Americans find that ... [noise]\nAnd yet this is what senator Baldwin\nStands for and have a hard time explaining obviously because it is absolutely disgusting [noise]\nI Believe that we should support life I have always supported life [noise]\nI remember the young nurse holding a twenty four week old baby and my hands and I saw that tiny heart eating just feeding so quickly under that thin shafts while trying to cling on to life and senator ... belief that that's a woman's right\nTo choose that is\nA right to kill it's wrong I Will always a poet that\nI could move man or a lifetime\nAnd I have to invoke the option again the question was about what would be done after roe v Wade especially on behalf of women [noise]\nAbortion is wrong\nWhat can I say abortion is wrong there are other choices I don't understand why people look at it from this perspective\nI have met people\nTo give them up for adoption\nAnd they're so grateful that those parents gave them life\nInstead of a boarding them I don't know why we aren't talking about these other\nOptions that are available there's so many people that want to assign children your ...\nThirty seconds they appreciate will move on the next question goes to then [noise] I'm Sorry to Melissa thank him for going\nTo turn our attention now to immigration if we can just moved here we are here in America's dairy land where Wisconsin dairy farmers rely heavily on immigrant workers many of them undocumented a study by Texas A M university says the loss of immigrant workers will negatively impact the state's signature industry\nThis movement and you have said that a wall must be built before anything can be done about immigration\nLaw could be years away what should farmers do in the meantime\nSo I'm the daughter of Greek immigrants and I spent a childhood watching my aunts and uncles come to this country I helped them study for their naturalization and citizenship test they assimilated into this country they wanted to become American they would so important to them to become a merit Americans\nFeel very strongly I still feel very\nStrongly that that border security that Wal Mart he built the first and foremost thing I stand with President Trump when it calls for that and I got to tell you as I travel around this great state people strongly feel that way why are we letting people crossed this order\nParticipate in this American Experience I Believe that senator Baldwin on the other hand would prefer open borders complete open borders I don't believe it I Know it from Senator ball one's perspective her idea of a of a border would be a drawing a line in the dirt with a wink and a nod she reports\nThirteen gang members coming across our border she doesn't even vote for ... law imagine the young beautiful woman in California\nLess high profile shootings that we hear about 'em but yet things that are diverse fading ah our communities\nAnd I believe it's a no brainer to get rid of bump stocks after we saw what happened in Las Vegas there's bipartisan agreement we ought to get to the\nTime is up say see we're going to go now to individual thirty second question for which we don't have a re bottled unless you attack each other so we're going to start with Holly with your thirty second question [noise]\nIn the interest of bipartisanship center Baldwin is there an issue on which she agrees with President Trump's against who have thirty seconds Oh thank you for that\nActually there's quite a few issues on which I agree\nI start with uh the fact that the president came to the notion Wisconsin to a signed his executive order on by America I talked to the president before he came and said I was working on by America infrastructure uh legislation and in ... he said I back at a hundred percent\nJust last week I passed a bill that adds to buy America I also agree with the president on approach to renegotiating trade agreements that have not served are working people well\nThank you and laugh and say All right so that one will go on to ...\nOr how about a similar question in from here or their policies from the ministry of the do disagree\nI'm pleased with how the president is working so far and working so hard for America in the last two years that he's finance and unlike most people\nI don't want to see this president fail I Want to see the president's sixteen and I think the president's doing an amazing job he's standing up to foreign leaders\nPeace through strength when I think about how our previous administration President Obama how would it to foreign leaders literally and figuratively\nOr time itself and you didn't answer about whether or not there is any subject on which you just agree to let the record show that but we'll move on I'm giving a ... a so far and All right let's go onto the next administration time is up\nTo a job with plenty of talk and plenty of campaign ads in this race as well as some of the ones you know\nFor most of the report detailing over prescription of opioids job of you you took responsibility for what you wish you would have done differently and you're handling the situation\nYou know when I learned about the fact that the VA was over prescribing I immediately took action and I worked along with the family of\nA veteran named Jason some husky who died at the VA that family um\nWidow and a child said we want to turn our tragedy and hope for other veterans\nDa Vinci and the VFW\nI said it or I'm Sorry your time with us we have rounded legislation to that [laughter] [noise]\nBut ... and thank you very much we are going to stay with the Tomas may ... the family of ... who died of an overdose\nAt the ... support senator Baldwin's campaign [noise]\nThe family has also called the end\nThat your campaign is airing which mentions Jason as shameful why have you continue to air that and [noise]\nMy heart goes out and it's an ... family and they're to be commended there should be commended for forgiving senator Baldwin for her lack of action at what happened there but it was more than Jason ... who was affected\nCountless veterans have been affected and are still affected today because they have been over prescribed fourteen and Fifteen drugs the drugs for the chain out into the community and senator Baldwin only jumped into action when ... when ...\nStatement and so the closing statements are two minutes in length\nOf the coin talk this at a remove near we'll go first with roof near um and I'm just going to give you a little bit by the time are going to show you thirty seconds and then a minute thirty that's just a quirk of the time where I Want you to know that not to be rattled I got your back or if we start [noise]\nWell thank you W VA force sponsoring this debate and I'm sure that the listeners and viewers today 'cause the the very stark differences between senator ... when I myself senator Baldwin as somebody who is extreme\nRepresent the extreme of her party senator Baldwin looks to government for all of her solutions I'm a mom of caught who just got into action because I was concerned about the overreach of government and my daughter's classroom\nYou know people in Wisconsin are looking for leaders the usual understand the day to day challenges facing families\nI grew up in that big fat Greek family teaching my aunts and uncles to study English so they could assimilate into this country\nI work my way through college and I and I taught my children how to read because\nSchool wasn't doing it I wanted to make a difference I jumped into action and made a difference [laughter] I Know what it's like to try to make ends meet and I know what it's like to worry about getting your kids to college\nSenator ... doesn't understand these day to day struggle senator ball when it's far more comfortable with her friend and the Hamptons and she is at a friday night fish fry in Wisconsin\nWhen a veteran died at the VA her only reaction was to be concerned about our own job\nThat is a trail of Wisconsin values [laughter]\nI've been a nurse my whole life I have taken great pride and taking care of my family's in my patience I have made a difference in their lives I Want to take that same passion to Washington and represent the people as I have done here in Wisconsin\nI thank you very much I'm asking for you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean
