I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a recipe is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races down a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse in morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine\nAnd they lost and I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the facts\nIs that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things that are called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we have been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this what certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know it's rich versus poor old versus young black versus white whatever\n... nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case a professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned that she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a witness to the assault and the eye witness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decay said I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of decay into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance I has a history teacher I founded painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process of the rule of law collapses over in totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low\nA we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the the new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling in war and the forty eight states\nUh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe you don't even know their name is\nWhat he has put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know\nI've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes\nI Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas\nRight down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think\nThis could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us\nBehind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a dismal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to see ... happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain an Obamacare stays all this\nOr they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and be in the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares about the country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm not I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity of anger about the way the liberals smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our ah or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me what a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning want one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including a couple of recounts and I had very big races my experiences\nAnd I said it's every candidate\nDo not quit to the polls closed and do not relax until the recount has over a this is a business where\nWake up with medicine in the morning we gain mornings after [noise]\nOf the house Newt Gingrich so I I Will say this if we allow this to get rewarded and they get power as a result of this or\nWhat but we're not going to know till Saturday of impact judge Kavanaugh is confirmed and\nYou know I I Hope Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are satisfied I Know who Susan Collins so she was satisfied with the FBI report and Jeff Flake said the same thing I don't know where Lisa Murkowski is he has not spoken publicly as of now but I Hope we don't reward this behavior because if we do\nTo me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this and anybody that\nThe Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing and slandering that goes on and I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show and this is the absence\nOf malice how do you proven absence of malice it's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach\nWhich is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure looks well let me just say I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior and I think you've seen it now and the kind of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved very significantly\nAnd the last week and it shouldn't reaction to out despicable\nOh and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats have been and they brought this on themselves and I think that they're now going to reap whirlwind\nOr I missed the

containers [laughter] I don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who remember the parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from those friends so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I had a party and there are people that know about that as part of\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nSo if you cannot get a single person given to you names given to you that would corroborate their story to actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing not\nNot in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the whole you know so they could gang rape exam\nWell I'm Me gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party you don't know if he did anything to the punch this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might have some legitimate reason to air this but because they want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they

some cooperation to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by\nAccusations because in each case there hasn't been any corroborating
