country on earth would the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim combing he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller\nHe is the guy that signed the third ... the fourth Pfizer\nApplication to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page or the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what rod roses\nSign is now saying well Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as Mick Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying did he or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness and if they're wrong there's consequences\nWe all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in ... when the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court and you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate\nBut there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first he gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified as we head into may nine months into the investigation\nInto so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in the history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peter structure tech confirmed that there is no there are there\nBut anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing cool is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why what he especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn or we have a lot of information\nWe're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona ... Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero\nTo me well long Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean good news polling operation\nRats musician a by the way they had the best accuracy record in twenty sixteen and the presidential election when so many others were wrong now saying that Republicans are tied with Democrats\nOn the twenty Eighteen generic ballot latest raspy recent survey forty five percent of likely voters would choose a democratic candidate if the elections for Congress were held today\nAnother forty five percent off for the Republicans three percent prefer another candidate that's set up by point recent improvement for the G O P but if you go back at this time in twenty fourteen prior to the last non presidential\nA year congressional election Democrats at a forty one thirty nine lead but Republicans went on to win nine Senate seats and increase their majority in the house\nWhat that means if I can interpret for you it means that in twenty seven days we the people have the opportunity to shock the world again\nAnd not reward the outrageous behavior of the entire Democratic Party establishment in the last two years and and more recently with judge Kavanaugh\nAnd by the way another sign that Chuck Schumer is antique Kavanaugh strategy was a public relations disaster another poll finds raspy it was in that\nRepublicans are more angry about the cabinet controversy the Democrats are more determined to vote in the upcoming election because of it new recipes some poll shows that sixty two percent of Republicans are more likely to vote because of what the Democrats did\nThe judge Kavanaugh compared to fifty four percent of Democrats a that is a good sign for twenty seven days and on top of that Democrats keep Everytime they open their mouth and they expose what they're real agenda is its investigation it's impeachment it's take the crumbs back and eliminate the\nThe tax cuts that have been helping the economy so much and of course they want to keep Obamacare and actually quote strengthen it\nIn other words make it worse and on top of all of that eliminating ice and open borders has a lot at stake\nI when we come back a category of for hurricane landing hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds in the panhandle of Florida job is starting whether bell dot com he'll join us and he'll give us the latest Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan on the issue of whether\nRod Rosenstein will testify Greg Jared damn bungee know much more all coming up stay with us [noise]\n\nWill you retire worry free Cohen investment group can help you get the answer I'm Aaron ...

Camille once you get ...\nYou get Camille in there about past Chris John and those places that are ... a benchmark storm there and done and Charlie down south of Tampa or the benchmark storms there of course Andrew in Miami or they're Nineteen twenty six was a bad storm along the coast but it was only a category three\nUp near Pensacola no this is this is the ... the worst storm\nNow when we get a look folks to the east of the tracks severe weather tornadoes are going to break out\nTonight into tomorrow and we're talking on southern and eastern\nWhen you lay on Easter the crack you're talking now about the Georgia but it's going to be a little south of Atlanta a direct kind of hit an eighty hundred miles an hour I'm guessing into Augusta\nWell no I think I think Augustus is sixty to eighty maybe Ninety miles now it will back off by them making making like I said it may get gusts as high as that southwest Georgia where it's going to be entering into a couple of hours they're going to be seen with a hundred hundred and twenty miles an hour and ... and there\nI mean that that's phenomenal because you've got to understand folks as powerful as these things are when they get inland friction all the facts\nAre it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one a sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring if you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all well these things have perfect machines but once they get inland fractional affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water\nThey ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative winding down how many times as a ... Georgia get when sit near hurricane force\nFrom a storm that hit all the way down or close to ... miles or two hundred and fifty miles to the south west but the toward an addict activity yeah make sure we cover for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina eastern North Carolina\nAnd in fact last year for the first time in over a decade we actually had a positive uh\nIn migration number in Wisconsin so that's\nThat's that's a good place to start and I think right to work is going to a help in that regard the other thing that I think we need to do and and something that Governor Walker has has talked about\nA new tax credit for us we spend an awful lot of money I'm educating kids through or you W system getting them a world class education\nAnd then they pick up and they we can go find a career in another state we got to figure out a way how to keep the kids that we invest all this money in right here in Wisconsin and that'll be another part of the solution\nYeah I mean that's something else to consider as well we had for a while for I mean I remember when Jim Doyle was governor we were talking about a brain drain\nUm where do we need it and so we have actually I it it appears B. gun perhaps to get our arms around the brain drain\nBut that's something else to consider as well but having in migration in Wisconsin senior population grow is is immensely important to making sure that we stay a magnet which which gets us to Foxconn\nUm we could be a magnet not just for you know high skilled manufacturing jobs well paying high skilled manufacturing chance we could be a magnet for attack something else we could be a magnet for and that's mining if we can actually get\nThe you know the the the the regulators and the activists side of the way we could also up north turn the light switch on and become a magnet\nA because right now it's only Minnesota\nMinnesota's seems to be just you know taking every single um you know possible it's possible mining expansion and keeping it for itself but that's something else we could do that can make us a leader not just a leader in the mid west but the leader in the Midwest\nYeah and and we know mining can be done safely and you just look at\nMinnesota and Michigan to states with a rich history of mining and they've done it the right way they've shown that you can do it the right way I don't think anybody would say that the land up ten thousand lakes as it is a toxic waste plant or as the environmental wireless would have us believe\nTotally agree with you I think in many respects because of the challenge of geography and rural communities but the northern part state\nUm being able to take advantage of the financial resources up there like iron ore and like copper and nickel and gold\nAh that that would really be a game changer for them\nAnd it would be a game changer for us statewide 'cause you know lifts all boats great to have you on the show Scott thank you very
