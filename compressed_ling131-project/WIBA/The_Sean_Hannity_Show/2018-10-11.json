why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it your listeners and the people that\nAre truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must come yet\nHe must raise is right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nAre really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nWhat about the president now talked about the ...\nSo fine and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr ... told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact percent yup yup and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we went to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve adult\nSo the so called real too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about the classical and what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications for Andy McCabe page all those documents as well that would include my number so we we need all that information\nVicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party which you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides just you know the the phobic phobia folk kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they tried to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back to work at a back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation and likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nAnd you chronicled isn't your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have ginned up this rage not all but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee hold the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe thinks he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever ... name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I\nThey do well what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and in peach Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\n... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\n... and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut as Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to to to be confirmed as well\nSo this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come up and\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna\nHappen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority and the courts\nDoes it does the things you wish everyone would do like saving money and so much more with the best burn is to not be in the industry agile yours today\n[noise] [noise] just to be boring to me

in the hopes of getting something on tape that that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment is the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted and released the American people that hasn't happened yet\nAnd the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller\nUh why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nWell he doesn't want to transcribe the interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does this leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really want you to say oh you know Mr good lab which is Jude I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein were July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't ah he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement of Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversation ... ... remembers the which which is why there's just so critically important\nWell they've got to do and they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put on my own and these answers have to be given but\nUh I got to let your books

bell dot com well everything you predict that as we talked earlier in the program today has come true\nThis is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought of could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I you know and my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a that we put it out publicly with the Patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks\nThe first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern coming in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October\nProbably because of the Gulf War right now you said it right on the show I Know\nRight right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up everything got together\nAnd that's why and you see that every once in a while\nLet me put it in perspective is the worst storm ever to hit between ... camp I that I can find on records okay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something it was so we're not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your educate All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years\nIncluding Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida which weakening off peak most of these hurricane to we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they go out to go in and look at the damage\nBut there's a lot more left to this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in a central Georgia that'd be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour at ... you will escaped the worst\nBut I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of ... built by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then it will move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late Thursday night\nOn out to speak to the south of New England just be glancing blowing the Ninety five quarter in the meantime for

the October surprise because you know early voting is happening now and as the stock\nMarket goes down the media loves to\nTalk about the Trump it kind of me may have to opt out and we may be headed back to our Obama reality or some some such thing so there are suspicions\nThis is all being manufactured in other words the leftist willing to take a financial hit\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job or as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close\nA we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort or with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely\nUm in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well is that what fifty one percent and Rasmussen\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now how her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats I ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera\nWere just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying your fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the white blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources a phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious\nGetting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world you know they got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you know I Want to get in\nMichelle Obama was on the today

until then the only thing that the Republican theme to\nRecognize and respect strength [noise]\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be typical of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick them\nAll Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and to think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid of their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything\nWhen Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist mumps and they are moms and this this is Rand Paul point out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if

face kick them when they're down you don't follow them in the gas stations in grocery stores\nYou cannot be hit with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about

you want to be a part of the program a media I had a piece out it's it's not generally well known I never knew this but the son of Obama national security adviser Susan Rice while her son happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice camera and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week and the Stanford Daily reports that\nRice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nAs a student news outlets citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person a rest at rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nStamford daily quota law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and rice camera and refused evaluation by paramedics Hernandez along with multiple other witnesses dispute that characterization and claim Hernandez merely touched him after he refused to stop\nVideo recording a her without her consent I don't know if you saw the recent video my friend and colleague Brian kill me to the Fox news channel Ryan's walking the streets of New York and these guys that they just would not let up Bryan goes on the subway there in the subway go\nIf you want to say something about somebody that's best friends with Donald Trump saying now\nI mean it's unbelievable\nAnd what are you supposed to do with that you can't react he can't say anything but it's they're creating you talk about what are we what ... what a liberal is always a hostile environment they're creating a pretty hostile mob like environment in some cases\nWe showed the video what went on in Portland where literally people driving their cars are being stopped their cars being kicked\nGod Forbid if you had to make America great bumper sticker on your car or were wearing a make America great\nHad God help you in that particular case it was an all of this has been encouraged by the so called leaders of the Democratic party and that's what you that's all we got to understand here\nThis is the modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered there's a lot of hate being pedaled around a lot of innuendo now we know the not the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence\nYou know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly no alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize if there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are\nWrong we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people my back down what's gonna happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a knife to a rally there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nYeah they need to come the rhetoric town\nIt's not like what are they going to do they're going to go out there and say well we're running on raising your taxes were running on open borders in eliminating ice we're running because we want to impeach the president we've tried for two years to undermine this man we've had the power of the deep state\nAt levels that well nobody ever thought could be so corrupt\nYou know talking about putting a wire on the president and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment on the president just because they lost\nYou know in the end the whole Russia investigation was created by phony smoke and mirrors even lease the page said ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler yeah there was no there there they had nothing on Trump and Russia and any collusion\nSo what did they do well they went to their their strategy which was their plan B which was oh let's let's let's leaked to the media everything in the Clinton bought and paid for it down the a\nSo let's talk about something else as well and that is of course it isn't free to do this it's expensive to do this it's it's ... per flight is very expensive so if you if you are of of of the means a donations are enthusiastically encouraged as well\nUm I think that's something that maybe brand you don't want to just say it but I can ask for the money\nYou know I'm not sure where but I'd rather I'd rather you know [laughter]\nWe have a great support in our community for what we do and are want your listeners know that those are Jewish to donate to us Becca Ninety six cents out of every dollar goes straight to flight ... which are flights costs a hundred and ten thousand dollars\nWe're man one hundred percent volunteers there's no page that I'm so just know that the money that you're giving us who's going to go\nStraight to what you want it to go to\n[noise] yeah so it's something that you know if if you're concerned it's a highly highly highly efficient charity it's it's in you know you don't get that very often so to say you know Ninety six cents of every dollar is going directly to what you want to support\n'em that's huge and that that's a testament to the ... again you said ... it's twelve or Thirteen Years two thousand five right to two thousand five\nAnd still in it and it hasn't been sort of co opted by administrative charity group thing I Love that but it's still a hundred percent almost a hundred percent of your dollar will go straight to that flight I think that said a testament to the you know just the dedication of you guys\nWell thank you very much we work a work real hard at it and a\nLot of work but when you get to Saturday\nAnd you see those veterans in the spouse interfaces and end up you see when it come home to their families you're like it's all worth it\nAnd uh I I Want to do it again and that's what we call to recharge the battery cycle it's a long day when you see that you're going to be one day to charge the battery let's do it all over again and that's going to a tree weeks ago\nYeah 'cause on Saturday is is a badge or on a flight departing from Dane County a regional airport and then again I November third and if you want to learn more either how you can volunteer to maybe to make phone calls and postcards those kinds of administrative tasks that everybody forgets are necessary to run a proper charity\nUm or make a donation or just learn about it or make an application\nFor of a guardian or let your veteran loved one no this is how you do it better on our flight dot org I I just think you guys are amazing Brian and I do very much thank you for being on the program today\nWell thank you very much and I look forward to you coming up above her third place

just a way of saying you needed to help from Michael angles kind of an all hands on deck suits you do when like that and it's a [noise] and you know what everyone and football team when you're in\nAny part of that messaging is that\nIt does take everyone and\nDo what you saw him all players on whether you are there to look awfully funny if you had eleven guys on one side and one on the other and then it's the same thing\nYou know what we hadn't had to storing up points on all things where you get sometimes points in special danger and you've got to stop it truly does take everyone to win and and I felt like\nDidn't or perfect for either side of the mall and especially but all three had to give us an opportunity to win the game and it felt like it was a nice when and therefore that's why I said\nThis I hear it I went all the time I heard it baseball now that's really true when I first heard about go whoa yeah your team wanted to see what what do you mean by that but it could help from help from every it's not just one guy\nOne guy or one unit carrying it and it's certainly something that that's what's really awesome the game as all the games will play out differently and yet\nYou need everyone to do enough on their end of it and give yourself a chance to go and see if we talk about the game winning shot or the game winning play what was that the one the first\nQuarter period any or was that the last one\nThey all stack up so that's where it's a [noise]\nI'm trying to get too deep on anyone\nJust the first time I heard that when you do not the first guy ever say to me how

I mean the little things right\nLittle things are huge and and that's about it and we've seen some of those were let him drop and and I forget which gave was even though we're [noise] we talked about that was thirty seven or eight while you're while you're already so marriage so now you're talking about if you do to stop that Fifteen and he said that she's thirty yard swaying soldier he yeah it\nWas a game that you mentioned that were crochet not only there were there in the return you ain't got a pretty nice bloc so that helps bring Jonathan Taylor began when people have or we are just fed works in a speech to the chime in on that as well but that's pretty cool and I got a hundred and fifty thousand afraid to maybe play a little bigger if you know he's\nNot at all and uh and it's you know what it shows up armor Danny Davis last year is our first game and he had to block the kind of helps training center in the end zone and you know what receivers day to do that [noise]\nLike you said as much for the other guys just see that they're willing to put themselves in the end of the mix a little bit and um [noise]\nHe was lucky Bernard anyways it would\nProbably but it's just it's it does you know what you appreciate\nThe way through it in their head and I would say the same way he ran on the kickoff return to use it a little bit on the jets sweeps and he is a and you guys are saying that you saw it earlier in the spring I feel that it's one thing that he is he's not afraid of the context of a game just\nRemind yourself that you're watching from the outside looking in the ... still\nCustoms games from week to week I'm a practicing in the school that's on top of those\n... those are the\nYou're right those are the things that people don't see it but they're really

damage or J.

and so I think this year has been different with the\nAbility to play for games and not count against your ear\nAnd um I think we're still kind of\nSeeing that play out a little bit and figure it out but there are some that we all are not ready yet and that doesn't mean that they're not going to be really good football so\nI Would say can maybe we've talked about it was just for Soviet every year when you get to specially later into October November either my cry or somebody who's going to ask you about dog days for scouting and try it but now with the four games [noise]\nAllow instead if you want to call it that day I still maintain your freshman status I Would think invested issue at all or if it was good wouldn't now here's a chance right\nAnd I think there is is probably similar to

talking about ... and maybe [noise]\nCollege practices every bit as it has a high school again so you're talking about many more days of doing it for the NFL you don't do that kind of go and so

the one we talked about should yeah you got for gay and many times you can't just go through the motions right now you've got to treat it like you're getting ready to play in the guise of a sudden said he was doing that but it could be a real thing for\nThem and trying to keep a balance on your special teams is far suffer class versus young players to try to sprinkle it or do you try and so I'm going to get my Lebanon best players feel very uh very volunteer to some of your senior fallen cheer for how do you go about saying okay do you want to play special teams or do they come up to you and say I do want to play special programs\nYou know I think that probably a little bit of everything you know clearly how can we put our best players out there who feel they have to be that's the only thing that's fair and rights of the teams are guys I'm I'm fortunate you know we are fortunate I should say\nOur players they embrace to special to them so they know and many of them kind of got their
