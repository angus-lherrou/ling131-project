destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot are new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation is kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now record unemployment and\nFourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine

that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the\nKeystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too it's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for

think\nPelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people what are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you\nKnow what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit\nRemember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history we know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted some painted emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it at some structure\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter ... one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero\nAnd they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered than all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the capital issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nOr by the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThat they went out and hire the former and my six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dusty a when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is\nBaker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath and Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at\nMeddling in the twenties sixteen election in other words he was a cut out it was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it\nThe question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about that in effect you know its application then for the Pfizer warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even\nThe guy to put it together doesn't stand by but anyway the ... the application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D. OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes has she was on with Maria ... big on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice we're doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the pies warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's embalming here\nThey wouldn't have been a finds the application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or die ca on Trump we wouldn't be living through second year of\nThe cost of resorted centrally located on the shores of el ... like she was Ninety minutes from Madison\nCall for meeting incentive for more information visit awesome meeting dot com that's awesome meeting dot com\nTune into Thirteen Ken WNBA each Tuesday Morning at age four straight talk from the house with certified financial planner ... we'll give you scrape talk on money management the markets and some financial planning gifts Tuesdays at eight here I'm Thirteen gang WNBA\n\nGo the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the capital issue but the bigger bomb\nThat come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicled by both\nThe deputy director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was\nIt was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third of official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said\nSo now we've got three witness does it say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\n[noise] better than ever auto cycles guitars really get away packages in more\nGet ready to bed and big and medicine just got kind of\nGet a jump on holiday shopping and save up to sixty percent on retail and put them fine back\nDot com [noise]\nOur areas most trusted heating and cooling down for our country does the things you wish everyone would like June option advice that'll save me as much money and energy as possible\nKill here's that's getting a Daphne ... new homes burnt or what the people I Try to get my news from France or in any kind of an hour I thank you and again we have fire in Oregon gas mining\nDiscussed happens all the time I Know this my furnace is so much more efficient than ones from just a few years ago and you can see me on every energy bill but only if I keep it running right we do which is why I invested in my savings with a furnished tune up\nFrom the best in the business as founder Larry Davies says nothing feels better than making our customers feel great comfort services does the things you wish everyone would do like saving money and so much more with the best furnished you end up in the industry agile yours today\nAbout how they go to W. I. V. A. dot com slash\n[noise] [noise]\nRaining swap ... at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nTwenty five 'til the top of the hour a scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job authority the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane and the golf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola immobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this was a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in the Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean look the average person including me\nHas no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it\nReaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nAbout the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and he said well what does that have to deal with as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap on ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know and then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get them ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we

when the exact opposite was true\nYou know I mean they they were lying from the get go on this and the media was just they grabbed their palms insure them\nIf they did it was it was a you know you said you can't trust the press that's American twenty Eighteen you can't trust the press to tell you the story because the presser partisans British and there should be trying to earn back though trust what they want to know\nBecause they can't see how they lost it they think it's all Trump's fault because he makes fun of them when the reason why Trump's make make fun of them is because

with it's nothing new it is there one and only play book and we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in midterm elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise\nOn the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt built today to fully fund the wall but he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now have record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nLast time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world that won the world series that's how far back that goes Hispanic\nAmerican unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to presidents\nKept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the\nKeystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too it's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think Nancy\nPelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted some painted emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nTwenty sixteen\nLong before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet an issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James cone me\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nRemember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil will they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost it turns out they\nThe higher fusion GPS in our research group\nThat they went out and hire the former and my six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain but anyway this revelation is\nAnd his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boy friend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third of the ... general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word\nThrough intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\n[laughter] you know we're nine what's new today on the free I heard a radio I mean\nFor decorating the house or just setting to remove\nMighty

for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three\nAh and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and it's being I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\n... so I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not have Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three to four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in the Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a police that strong category ... perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember showing last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look the average person including me has no idea\nWhy the actual angle of the ... when it\nReaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical site clones September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely I say well what does that have to deal with as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and watch we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico felt that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with or it's this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the south west\nCorner race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately in a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in
