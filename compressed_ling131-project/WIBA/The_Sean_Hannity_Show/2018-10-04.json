days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know you can't have shame if you're only interest is Rob power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power\nOf the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for having all your complicit with evil best raw power or the kind of smearing dishonest\nQuestions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's gonna be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are well\nI just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really to the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh they're lonely do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week ... most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kavanaugh one of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a vicious personal attack\nAll those things I think mean that the Susan Collins who what was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire\nCaucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days\nOf what you did accomplish that task and Republicans for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road have been in power since ... how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should these congressmen and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota\nAnd he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you weren't resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos\nA continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president has set the

did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man\nThat would never vote the way he really felt because he's only

anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody I mean that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nUh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers you know how soon we all forget about these things but it ... I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey\nCasey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then did not make them public\nAnd yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general is a California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous Jane Doe\nAccusation that's how the person's signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid ... is there no to corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't you sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweat and they can particularly that\nIf in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now we examined\nEvery single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there were so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever air that interview but\nThey are today anyway the eye witnesses or the witness to she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her poor structure of a congressional Percy\nBeing by submitting fault that David and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that Mitt sweat it\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment\nWhen professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be a Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise and remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah attach\nNever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton and it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace\nAnd also defended in in the case of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ...

A.\nAmerica's wounded warriors\nCan sometimes be a battle\nMaking the transition back\nTo civilian life for active duty with a traumatic injury\nBut they did the right thing they brought in a ... a special prosecutor to to talk to an interview professor Ford every consideration was given although one has to wonder why the attorney\nCourse recommended by Dianne Feinstein who never told Brett Kavanaugh the Republicans any of this that which she knew in July\nAnyway they were attorney that's inconsistent on this important issue of our time but anyway\nBob Corker even read the FBI report\nAnd he said it offers zero corroboration for professor Ford sexual assault allegation and he will be voting chicken from Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court following this FBI background check that he said absolutely zero gr operation of the allegations that have been\nMade now look I told you from the get go there was no way that there was going to be any other conclusion to this for the following reason\nWhen the Senate Judiciary committee when they finally got wind of what Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats knew back in July and that they hid from the Republicans\nWhen they got wind in the Washington Post piece published professor of Ford's account well they sprung into action and they began their own investigation and professor for did mention that there were four people at the party where this\nAlleged assault had occurred\nAnd they did their due diligence and they interviewed the poor people and under the penalty of a felony\nAll four people went on the record\nAnd some didn't remember the party in any way shape or form including professor for one of our best friends\nAnd professor forwarded identified more judges the one guy that would have been an eye witness to this alleged assault back thirty six years ago he said absolutely positively did not happen\nAnd then when the Democrats you know and you have senator snowflake going along with senator Coons and all we just need a limited just limited in scope just a quick short investigation FBI they should be able to wrap it up\nWell in this case and we'll talk about the other cases as well well in this particular case we don't have a place we don't have the time we don't have a location we don't know the house we don't even know the exact year to be honest anyways so they had very limited\nRoom to to corroborate professor Ford story of what the the only available venue for them or avenue for them to pursue this case remember they were\nNever going to make conclusions are recommendations that is what we learn from Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One anyway they sprung into action they went out we had already had professor boards\nA testimony now multiple\nPoints you know even though there was some inconsistencies between her testimony before the Senate and our test and the the count that she had given to the Washington Post and her attorney failing to hand over any evidence as regards in regards to how the polygraph was\nAdministered or any of the therapy notes that they willingly handed over to the Washington Post without hand that over to the FBI so\nDeborah cats who is the liberal activists attorney for professor Ford has donated tens of thousands of dollars to liberal causes and candidates and she's the one that set off Paula Jones ... come on I was only ten twelve minutes\nI mean that doesn't constitute any type of work for sexual\nHarassment well that shows she's not consistent on the issue\nThat was the person recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nWho's making the recommendation while she's meeting privately with judge Kavanaugh and not telling him a thing that any of this is going on that's the left wing activists lawyer though that professor porn I or don't blame her I mean Dianne Feinstein was the one that suggested at all\nAnyway so the only avenue for the FBI to pursue in the case professor Ford was to ask\nBefore people that are ready testified under the penalty a felony the same questions that you would normally ask where are you there do you ever recollection no no no no no and mark judge eat your supposedly an eye witness did you see this behavior this account of professor ports happened no\nAnd after that I don't see any other area where the FBI has any investigative tool available to them to go down and discuss the story there already been told by judge Kavanaugh as his passionate denial\nAnd the story been told and varying accounts and the Washington Post and when professor Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt wasn't that hard a job for the FBI Democrat says oh no the fixes it what are you talking about what what else can they do at that point what other investigative tools they have\nIf somebody makes a serious allegation about a a serious crime committed\nAnd they identify an eye witness in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the eye witness denies it the person that is accused denies it there's no other venue avenue of of investigation that they need to go into but they went\nFurther even though the New York times had well a lot of problems with Mrs Ramirez his story this is the\nThis is the case that happened that was printed by the New Yorker member of that particular case\nAnd in the ... case she was claiming well back then the first year when he was a freshman in college that he exposed himself to me\nWell after the New Yorker piece came out in the New York times they went out for over a week interviewing their words not mine dozens of people all and then the attempt to corroborate the story of Mr ... New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody\nYour times doesn't like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr\nKavanaugh was the one who exposed himself well I hate to say it based on her own words at that point that's it that cases over add to it\nAround his mission that cheap quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories\nAnd of course we've got door number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweating it\nAs soon as the woman that as being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News but does she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of the ones they wouldn't respond one of his dad and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and you had an ex boyfriend that had filed a restraining order against her and I I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence of what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend\nAnd well anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go\nFrom here I remember Mr wet neck was claiming that on a regular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis that these boys including Brett Kavanaugh as a teenager\nIn high school that they were regularly happened often almost every weekend she was at the parties that they were literally drugging girls against their will making sure they got an ... capacity hated and that\nThey would wind up in the halls of boys and the boys were then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well I don't know if he's spike the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl and\nLining up in the home I I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a whole\nIt's just not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd number two guy at the DNC always thinking of resigning his position as the number two guy or the DNC not one person not one Democrat angry today that the FBI investigation didn't go on and a purpose to witty\nAnd that we're going to get a vote finally on Saturday up or down if if judge Kavanaugh's if we if this fans what they have done here\nWithout any corroboration in any case and I'm not even talking about the outright lies that we're told and stories that were created and pushed into the media but if you if we're now going to convict people based on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Am done guilty case ever and it got raped by the FBI the preferred her over Donald Trump won agent struck saying well she should win a hundred million is zero\nAnd she gets you know her donors' money funneled through a law firm hires a\nFusion GPS than our research group they hire a foreign national which I thought was bad to have influence our elections a series of of documents come out it's known as the dot CA and the Democrats members of the deep state spreading their lives\nDonald Trump hookers rich Carlton hearing it and urinating on a bed\nIt's it and and so many people fed that lie to the American people how when are we going to stop rewarding people for what is their play book every single election season\nDemocratic Party in Missouri Ninety eight elect Republicans crosses are going to burn or the James Byrd ad or Al Gore you know before a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong changes his tone cadence voice\nAgenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you when the census\nAlly\nDirty air dirty water besides ...
