so\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up a Republican headquarters in Florida or we saw the terrible shooting in Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but\nYeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think a anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country a love for

information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knocked down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security and made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around that to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to\nWork in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership in Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam ... senior partner a and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole calling me up with my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm in the actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guy's been organized this sort of folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitution making ... ... they're in bed with the Venezuelans\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the march so again no great great mystery this is\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad in our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or the you know phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true\nAll conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic American sovereignty\nAnd come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity has managed to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm married I was I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he said and\nIf people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them no we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on the sun shine we don't want to be hurt and also it it was undoubtedly true\nThat most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S got probably been lied to the gun\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply ugly as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of\nFolks ... that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people being used\nNow look I Will tell you that\nYou know what I really feel sorry for people I'd taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times\nAnd of course back all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nI don't think it's the right way and I think it's a rich nominee Democrats are getting fed up with allies and the ... the deception of you know\nHillary and all of them and that's really getting sicker and ... by the name Trump so I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats Bush\nIf the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call west\nVirginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate\nRepublicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's gonna be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely so\nYou know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all into get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue\nWe really do need both houses\nBut this is Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman [noise]\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean

know saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's it it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there were candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the media again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics as the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here but there's not only are they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong\nTwo thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's filibuster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the GOP not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it\nBecause you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six he this is a this is all white lash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty forty no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe G O P claimed a similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term and you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing laws for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nOld they were wrong pure research was wrong\nBoy our friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump you know the rabbi set on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was home with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful I mean how\nPastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nTakes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit you know my friend\nI mean this is a you know this is stopping locally

Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz

P not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine state Senate\nLandslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to

mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought\nIn twenty fourteen known very few of us saw that we could\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control\nKind of similar where they are now the G O P claimed a similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races were the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber\nWould be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term and you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\n\n[noise] ...\nMaking a murderer became led the TV show of\nForce of

terrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday\nAnd no one in the media all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is ugly it is twisted it is sick it is the famine tore\nAnd frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel as comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted in he's receiving hate mail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer\nIt's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God in a temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from an identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell

exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention and then anyway and it was so\nThey invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful I mean how pastors and priests\nAnd you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my
