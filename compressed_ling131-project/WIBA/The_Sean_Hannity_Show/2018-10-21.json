now don't you want to be a guy come\nUp with one of the most important term elections in recent memory so much has\nElections do have consequences and whether it's a red wing Republican\nGood evening gentlemen and I'm Glad governor you brought that up because I talk a little bit more about education I think we add that relates to tactics\nIn five Marquette law school poll taken here on the Jordanian likely voter at that time that many I think the three percent want to increase spending on public pool instead of reducing property tax\nOn social media we asked about the balance and we have a number of responses from our schools are overcrowded and failing falling apart to I'd rather than say figure out where to\n[noise] and you both promise to find two thirds of our school and hold the line or caught [noise]\nHow are you going to do both governor and we'll start with you\nFirst off it's not just a question of if we actually done it in the last budget we gave the largest actual dollar investment in K through ... education and the history of the states I mentioned Tony himself called it a ... budget\nWe did it while still lowering the property tax burden on the hardworking people just stayed on senior citizens and family farmers are working families and others out there and we're able to do that again remember Tommy Thompson did this years ago but the way you do it is by keeping in place are reforms reforms that have saved school districts more than three billion dollars\nThat's money's gone directly in the classroom now Tony has said repeatedly during the primaries\nShe wants to undo those reforms that will take money out of the classroom away from students and he'd allow your property taxes go up to pay for it\nDon't take my word I don't look at the record for years Tony Evers has talked about needing to raise property taxes\nFor for many many years we've been told a false premise in the media that you have to choose between good schools and lower property taxes Tommy Thompson showed us years ago you can find two thirds instill lower the property tax burden on the hardworking people the state\nWe did not last budget with historic actual dollar investments in the school still lowering property taxes are going to do it again going forward\nLast important both of my kids man Alex are here they both want the public schools and what to my nieces are going public schools today I Want every child to have access to great education but I also want to make sure particularly for our seniors that we don't see the kind of property tax increases a twenty seven percent in the decades before we took office [noise] All right\nBut you even I certainly have a response and are are going back to the plagiarism is you're just for a second\nMy definition of the ... of of plagiarism is on Scott Walker take my budget and calls on his own bed as my budget that said he talks about this last year but the bottom line is sheer two thirds funding\nTo search funding and if we haven't got there in eight years I'm not sure why this election year thing but it is an election year thing way you've had eight years if you go Scott Walker and it it it hasn't happened yet\nAnd in addition during those eight years we've had over a million people at the state of Wisconsin a million of our friends and relatives that have gone to referendum\nTo raise their own taxes because Scott Walker has not provided enough revenue for a local schools it's pretty simple the people Wisconsin have spoken they know that\nThe last eight years has not worked for our public schools what I'm proposing is this a one point four billion dollar increase that includes a money for students with disabilities for probably six hundred million dollar increase at one point four billion additional dollars will also create opportunities for kids that need mental health services\nWe must move forward in the state of Wisconsin we cannot continue to move backwards the children of Wisconsin\nCounting on how to do this my budget will not raise property taxes and that is the truth [noise]\nLet's go to the next question to beat them on top of my movie the Spanish language radio in Madison looked into that because you\nKeep it on the topic of taxes\nYou have said they just want to cut taxes on middle class by ten pushed him\nComing or what you said you have nowhere to taxes for Wisconsin I\nJust suggest they do with more in the future\nI was calling him to stay on your own thoughts to cut taxes in order to remain paying nine cent either for Boeing and able to pay for the project and Kevin ... Wisconsin and different light on either\nSide and that's a great that's a great question my ... my tax plan is is I Believe the state of Wisconsin is a hard working middle class people\nHave had a difficult time over the last eight years lots of tax credits says you've talked about a ... have gone to wealthy people\nWhat my plan and this is is is we have to make sure that we are we treat the middle class fairly so anybody that's making a hundred thousand dollars or less a ... will get a ten percent income tax credits\nIn addition a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a as a as a family that's the ten percent or credit\nWe have to we have to make sure that the middle class in the state of Wisconsin stay strong and this is one way to do this but I'll tell you when we talk about taxes it is also about the fact and and I know Governor Walker talks about keeping taxes low but here's the deal whether it's poor public policy about transportation\nThat has resulted in we'll taxes that the local level user fees that the local level\nThat Scott Walker tax and the education world that's part of my world because of public policy decisions made by Governor Walker\nWhat has happened over a million people in the state of Wisconsin voted to raise their own taxes that as a Scott Walker tech does our tax increases we need to make sure that that our to our system is fair and I believe that ten percent for the middle class is fair and and it's doable\nAnd I feel very strongly that the people Wisconsin are with me on this one\nGo to the governor [noise] oh years ago I met a woman was kind of executive named Carol she and her husband bought their home and Nineteen fifty three and\nHer husband sadly pass away in Nineteen Ninety three and since then she's been able to stay in that home based on her pension a little bit of a bench and she got Social Security and for fifty five years she makes a little bit of money offering piano lessons to kids in the neighborhood\nShe's been pleased over the last eight years to see her property taxes go down because before that remember when Jim dog was governor property taxes went up for that decade by about twenty seven percent [noise] she's afraid now because she knows in the past Tony Evers has talked about raising property taxes over and over again you can go back and look at the record out they're\nAlso talking about raising income taxes on manufacturers manufacturers people that create jobs and opportunity in this state on on farmers at a time when they certainly don't need a tax increase in by raising the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon right here in this town he said the day after the primary\nEverything's on the table got reporter said\nWhat about a dollar a gallon gas tax increase he said everything's on the table he'll tell you in a minute it's ridiculous it's outrageous but he has yet to tell us how much is going to raise your taxes and ways in general and someone from Madison\nTells you are going to tell you after the election how much lookout you better hold on your wallet and persist because he's going to raise your taxes I have shown repeatedly in the past that we can cut taxes on the hardworking people in the state I'm working families\nAnd senior citizens that small business owners and family farmers we've done it before and we'll do it again just like time he did years ago when he signed a two thirds funding for schools\nAnd lower property taxes are going to go onto the next question and that goes to Jessica are of WINZ\nHold on to health care an estimated one eight hundred and fifty thousand people in Wisconsin could lose their health care if preexisting conditions aren't covered faith is still a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that would repeal the Affordable CARE Act and take away the requirements for pre existing condition coverage\nShould fate drop out of that and if the AC ate it overturned\nHow can you guarantee the state will provide affordable coverage for pre existing conditions especially in recent days legislative leaders had raised questions about whether they'll support to a new effort to to cover that weekend with Governor Walker\nActually only be clear we can protect people with preexisting conditions in the state was protecting the failure that as Obamacare look my wife who's here tonight is a type ... diabetic my mom who sitting right next to her as a cancer survivor\nMy brother has a heart condition or like a lot of you at home watching and when we talk about covering preexisting conditions for families it's very personal\nIn Wisconsin everyone living with preexisting conditions is covered right now and as long as governor it will always be covered in the state of Wisconsin the difference between Tony eyes about Obamacare Obamacare which is fairly\nI remember early this year talking to Christine up in the Green Bay area she told me under the Obamacare exchanges her premiums were going up by almost two thousand dollars a month a month can you imagine that's\nSo well why she didn't failed to act or Obamacare premiums are going up we put together a bipartisan solution we got Democrats and Republicans on board to pass or healthcare stability plan and just last week we got news that just as we predicted premiums will go down starting in January by over four percent\nAnd by ten percent from where they would have gone without our plan that's a savings in premiums have almost a thousand dollars now Tony's plan is to do with Minnesota did years ago\nIn Minnesota the premiums went up in fact two years ago this month the Democratic governor of Minnesota said the Affordable CARE Act is no longer affordable we cannot do that in Wisconsin\nOur plan lowest premiums increase his choices and improves health care while we'll go ahead and cover pre existing conditions\nSo and I'm doing I Would like to do going forward does it make sure that we continue and continue we have to change our focus a campy Hail Mary pass was for one part of the state\nAgainst the other one we need to do is invest in those they'll start off of those young entrepreneur is that ... they exist all across the state of Wisconsin where else those one or two or you're a recess says that are just growing\nAnd ready for help from the state they're not looking for a handout they're not looking for people to subsidize or their workplace but what they want us to make sure that they have an opportunity to get a loan up in the local bank\nWe can do this has to be Seventy two college the situation\nWe will have a state agency that's in charge of this we will get rid of ... and also we'll be working so that regional folks who helped make help us make those decisions\nThis is something that seemingly important for the state of Wisconsin every every person in the state of Wisconsin has to feel that they have an opportunity to reach for the stars and get out of the situation where they're they're wondering where their next meal is going to be coming from where child care how they're going to pay for childcare\nWe can change just we just need a Seventy two ... solution\nQuite a great question and re premise debate and we\nWere just solved the job numbers yesterday showed that for this eight month in a row unemployment is at or below three percent\nPrior to this year it has never been below ... percent in the state of Wisconsin It's been eight months in a row right now in twenty Eighteen we have more people in the workforce than ever before and this morning I looked on my phone to check our state website jobs in our Wisconsin dot com if you're looking for a job check it out there is more than a hundred thousand job openings in that say\nThat means they're technically more ... opportunities in our state today than there\nAre unemployed people in the state of Wisconsin we've got to make sure that every once in a part of that recover so I'm Glad that unemployment is not only down state wide it's at historic lows in county after county in every part of the state of Wisconsin\nBut we want to make sure that people get into the workforce and it's not just about jobs I'm pleased to say that\nThat wage growth uh I'll pay says nearly every other state in the nation this year as well and we want to continue to grow that and so we've got big things is part of our plan to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come like helping working families many of whom\nWhen they first have children find it challenging to get back into the workforce so we're providing a childcare tax credits to make it a little bit easier to afford childcare\nIf either spouse wants to get back into the workforce we're doing more things for people seeking public assistance to get them employ ability training and for those who might potentially be suffering from addiction gets in the health care\nAnd rehabilitation I Need to get back up on their feet again we can find a job for everyone in the state but it doesn't happen you're going to raise taxes like Tony Evers is talking about\nWe can get your back on the governor now so we can cover more territory was going to ask you to shorten your answers that they had this ... second answer to some good questions let's start with Jessica\nTo education\nWisconsin students teachers and administrators have a lot can be proud of and both of you has pointed out in your ads in recent speeches graduation rates and ACT scores are in the past ten in the nation\nBut think further and other statistics remain troubling including startling differences between students of different income levels and ethnic groups in performance and an increasing lots of young teachers from the profession what is the number one thing you think needs to be fixed about our public schools and how would you make that change\nHis first pick up and I walk up\n... I mentioned uh we have made historic investments the largest actual dollar investment\nIn said history and extra two hundred dollars for every year for every student in every part of the state of Wisconsin we expanded to nearly tripled the amount of use apprenticeships we've we've done things like expand fab labs we've done and things to make the connection between our technical colleges in their early start on her college uh in the University of Wisconsin system\nBut I think more than anything it's not just about funding because for example Milwaukee they outpaced by by almost forty percent the amount of funding versus the average school district in the state\nIt's about making sure those resources are targeted and\nIt does tie in to the previous question about building the economy if you've got communities that are working parents are working and communities are doing well and we're kids aren't moving around that actually helps deal with the achievement gap something that Tony talked about when he first ran in two thousand nine as being one of his top priorities it's still a challenge today\nAnd we're willing to work together with people at the local level in communities all across the state to make sure that every student graduates and every graduate as a game plan time Mr ...\nAbsolutely and there is a reasonable either those are cheap and ... still exist\nIs because the budget that the urban school districts and those school districts that have lots of kids are struggling need that extra lift haven't got it there hasn't been an increase in special education funding for for over a decade we haven't we haven't had the commitment I put things on my budget that I Believe will close that achievement gap\nAnd had been taken out of it taken out of the budget\nSo here's here's the or the other problem here\nScott Walker when it first came to office he said we're going to divide and conquer the state and one of the ... ways we do this is to make teachers and other public employees the enemy why couldn't tell you as a administrator all across the state and just common sense\nIf you're on the public sector of private sector making the workers at they actually do the work you're enemy you're not going to succeed\nSo going forward we're going to make sure that we have a robust budget that really impact there was achievement gaps and makes it makes it makes it better for the life of the kids in the states\nThank you Emily than\nThan education\nMany students are struggling with student debt\nAmong the almost eight thousand Wisconsin documented in their problem is intensified because they can qualify for in the tuition which Eighteen other states provide should DACA didn't get in state tuition and what can we do for all student loan debt\nThat they're either yes and ah here's here's what I Would do I would propose or support legislation allowed DACA students to be part of a two cabin in state tuition\nWe have to make sure that we recognize how important are young people are and and we can do that I I I've been to the schools all the time and I I share of young people are afraid of ... or you know people are afraid that they're going to rip departure their parents are going to be ripped away from them\nWe cannot allow that to happen in the states that is just not right now as it re through a release to ... ... how high it is\nThe problem one of the problems is frankly is that Scott Walker took over two hundred million dollars I think it's two hundred and fifty million dollars out of the higher education budget\nWe have to fund the best economic driver economic the driver that we have in the state of Wisconsin and that's our university\nGossip system we have to make sure that our young people have the opportunity to refinance loans in a way that it works not pretend ways that like we have no I support the legislative legislation and the budget right and the legislature right now to do that\nWhile I'm pleased at the University of Wisconsin has the largest budget they've ever had in state history but I Know over the years it's been difficult to cook for the high cost of higher education\nIn the decades before our freeze tuition and went up a hundred and Eighteen percent of the parents tonight and I knew that our kids just graduated a few years ago in fact our our youngest is a graduate University of Wisconsin\nSo I'm proud that we froze tuition six years in her own I Want to continue to freeze tuition for the next four years I\nI also increased needs based financial assistance for all of our colleges and universities public and private in the state so that more kids and their families could afford to send them to school now going forward worse ... nation based on immigrants were also nation based uh laws so we've got an extra folks in Washington change the laws so we can adjust things going forward\nBut when it comes to student loan debt we work with the you know the credit union to provide a competitive place 'cause they shouldn't be a back\nEven if your credit union allows access to any student and and this from the state to refinance their student loan debt at rates I should say that are competitive or better than other states who've done it on their own\nTime is up in the first part of the questions typically asked whether ... students should be entitled to in state tuition and they are and several other states could you address that please have thirty seconds\n... enjoy what I was saying about that is we're a nation of immigrants in a nation of laws laws are very clear at the federal level they need to be changed at the federal level from our standpoint we want to make college affordable for everyone out there which is why\nI mentioned we're talking about needs based financial assistance which we provide to students all across the state as well as freezing tuition to make it more affordable\nTo do that with the answer and no one in state tuition\nSays the law the laws are very clear at the federal level we cannot do that without being in violation of federal laws will go on\nThe next question goes to Jessica\nContinue talking here about immigration and agriculture walk ons in many dairy farm in Wisconsin and he will find a melting pot in the milking parlor studies show more than half of the labor force our immigrant\nThose workers and the farmers who employ them live in fear of the increased deportation actions as we saw in Wisconsin just weeks ago\nAnd what that could mean to this day forty three billion dollar theory industry do you believe immigrant labor should remain a part of Wisconsin dairy industry and what would you push for as governor Governor Walker will begin with you\nAgain as I mentioned uh we're a nation of both of immigrants animal laws when I was looking through some of my father's papers recently after his passing\nI saw some of the details about some of our ancestors Thomas Whelan who my father's first name was alone came from South central wells where his father was a minor and he came here to America as a blacksmith because he wanted to pursue freedom and opportunities like so many immigrants do today\nUh uh you know proceed for for the for the governor\n... policy in the state has been our we have encouraged people to produce and produce and produce and sell their ultimate credit the farmers are Wisconsin have done exactly that\nNow or in a situation where we have an overabundance we needed a department of agriculture that works to help farmers not only find foreign markets there's going to be a limited and on that but we also have to help them diversify\nMaking sure that they have the opportunity to look at different ways to raise crops have the University of Wisconsin that some parts\nThey can go to the ... these are the thirty seconds we find that and there is not a re bottle on though is that let's go to the question\nAnd that's half the gates mighty wind\nCan I jump in the in my line of plant that\nWhich was the last\n... pounds he's got Matty whining referendum west sun under\nAny form of money one of the ... in Wisconsin\nThese questions for both of you either\nDo our fire deaths\nAs a cancer survivor I absolutely believe that we must have a part of physicians must have the ability to use a cannabis and treatments a pet so that ... that is again with the second thing is we have to decriminalize the use of marijuana\nA and we have people that are suffering mightily because they broke that law third of all\nWe have a referendum over the state we continue to do it I'm willing to take a look at that and the results of those referenda and policy that aren't governor Washington legalization\nWall fears I listen to public health officials and law enforcement officials even here in Dade County who pleaded with us not to legalize marijuana because there are concerns the gateway drug to other drugs and we've seen the addictions with opioids was a heroin with mass in certain parts of the state\nSo yeah for your point about the juice we've actually use that we've modified that multiple times out for kids with seizures we've legalize industrial hemp which health spending where farmers but outright legalization I think from the folks and law enforcement public health they said that would be a big problem\nLet's go to ...\nIf you haven't known as the panel made up entirely of women and many call that thing here of the woman both candidates and voters to both of you starting with Governor Walker why should women vote for you\nWanting for the same reason and then should uh for us we offer a plan to keep moving to stay for ... years ago unemployment was at nine points three percent\nA student and I talked about before we were afraid our kids running around I have a job what a lot of career when I graduated from school or offering a plan to keep our graduate shared to make sure that every student graduates that every graduate has a game plan for their career and that we keep our graduate you're in the state of Wisconsin I\nWant to make it easier for working families there we enter the workforce\nAnd to keep taxes down while improving quality for education system in the state thank you gather Mr even\nWomen should vote for me for several reasons but education is what I Know how important it is a solid education is for a moms and dads are\nI I Know it's been something that's been very important to Cathy and our three children so we're going to have an education system we can be proud of what the other issue is around health\nWomen's health has been under attack of the state of Wisconsin we've been taken away all sorts of our rights and responsibilities that should be the decision of a woman and her physician\nThat takes it to your closing statement and by the time you're ... you are first with a two minutes close\nWell first of all I'd like to think a group here for a great opportunity to ask ... group to answer these questions and also the the the viewing audience so it's been a pleasure for me to talk about my vision for the future of the state of Wisconsin and I'm hoping that the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Madison", "day": "21"}
