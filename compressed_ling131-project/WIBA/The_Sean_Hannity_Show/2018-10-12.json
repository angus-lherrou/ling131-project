T. myself fell on a running behind them that's a kind of pick and choose which all you've got to run through\nSome fantastic production again tonight from the running a menu and Jonathan Taylor I think he's got about ... four Seventy in the two games against Nebraska and five touchdowns in the last two years that's pretty impressive stuff\nYeah he he had talked about last year or two longest or under against some brass yeah\nAnd they use wondering why it always came against them but yeah he's I mean he I mean he comes into play every day and I'm teams they got to prepare for me is ridiculously talented um and we're just going to lean on him going forward where you\nWant to be coming out of the week with a win tonight Michigan's up next and that that always brings a little extra to it when you talk about playing Michigan yeah absolutely that's\nSuch a great place to play although I've never been there um all the older guys and everything and all that it's a really tough place to play um obviously you've got a great team to um the throwing that to the max I'm but we'll watch the tape and I will get ready for Michigan certain ma\nSo as we hear from Gary ... there will hear from Michael Dieter in a minute\nI'm I Want to talk about what I mentioned before we heard from ... and that's the receiving gains a Jake Ferguson has really given them something from the tide imposition AJ Taylor has been consistent at the White House position but I think they're hoping and wanting to get more from the wide receiver death\nI Would agree the first two games they did Taylor was actually leading the Big Ten and receiving yards per game now that number is tapered off some it it was Wisconsin you're generally not can average a hundred twenty plus receiving arts again but he's\nTaken a major step forward and and I think when they can get Danny Davis\nA going a little bit more obviously it's going to be huge because he's a big threat if you look at the top three wide receivers right now with a J Kendrick prior and Danny Davis he's the guy that can make those special place we saw last season they had those three touchdown catch isn't the Orange Bowl against Miami he did not play those first two games dealing with this suspension and then the third game you looked rusty against BYU\nSo to me he's one of those keys off offensively to get the wide receiver group specifically going\nAnd we'll we'll get to how that plays forward into the matchup against Michigan in a little bit but earlier you mentioned how Wisconsin kind of leaning on a defense like they did against Nebraska to open up the run game and just after the badgers beat Nebraska I've visited with one of those leaders Michael Dieter I don't know if you know this\nBut in the two games against Nebraska now Jonathan Taylor has gone for four Seventy five touchdown something that has to make you guys feel great\nIt's always fun to watch him do his thing to say that we helped fund but special player as they can do that and saying when he plays against as long as we're on top of our stuff it's just so much fun to watch them make plays results watch Taiwan make plays and care make plays any one place\nYou guys had a by week to the kind of get ready and able to lean on some defense in this year especially in the second half done you feel that tonight when you came out in the third quarter the new are starting to open some things up\nYeah you just kind of feel feel teams question whether or not they really want to do it and and I thought they should do battles I'm not saying they laid down anything like that but\nYou definitely feel it sometimes the fish to start because because they used to be on maybe they're not ... says they had been in it that's encouraging that kind of what we want to do that's why we try to where people down\nAnd try to keep it moving the mouse with Ron plays clash and stuff like that [noise] um and that's got to be something that we can do to anyone we play against because that'll give us an advantage to come in the fourth quarter to another\nWest division opponent that you played tonight those are all everything in conferences big but when you play your own division ... you've gotten a little bit more control of the Big Ten west\nIs Austin for us to get that but I mean to me that when each week doesn't guarantee of anything but like you said because it's a little more control in the west but don't worry about just keep winning games you know they\nBring back that Ninety three teams kind of jumping off point for this program made it predates all of you and none of the players around are born for that but to have them back ah it's kinda cool and then\nI got to walk out with a job or a cat that was off to recall that can't and was there and so that even though I mean for twenty five years pretty close to be a part of it in school to the places that kind of made it where it was\nFinal thought here uh you haven't started preparing yet but Michigan's next and I always seems to be [noise] you know what I mean it is Michigan so it ... it carries a little extra doesn't it\nYeah I mean they're really good they're really good defensively officers were playing their place can play a so we've got to start Monday get prepared and then have a great practice Tuesday Wednesday and then the sharp and stuff up Thursday Friday and get ready to go on the road\nSo we have from Michael deterrent and that all sorts of mine is going to have a challenge we'll get to it a little bit later when we talk more about Michigan but they'll have a challenge my guess is that Michigan is going to sell out to try and slow and stop the run and make the passing game beat them Saturday Night\nI Would have to think so that should be any team strategy and considering how doubt that Michigan defenses that's what you want to do Jonathan Taylor is one of the best running backs in the country and so if you can negate that\nAnd make Alex ... try and be Easter the air that seems to be a sound strategy now Alex has been able to do it at times certainly that second half against ... to me this season is his signature moments so far\nBut he's going to have a great opportunity on Saturday\nWisconsin has been pretty good sense of Lee I think they'll need to be better to have a good shot at a when Saturday Night\nIn Ann Arbor Michigan

great [noise]\nOnce again back with you on badger prime on my calorie your host I'm joined by Jesse temple from the athletic dot com Wisconsin is one of the road at Michigan this week big primetime\nShow down as the badgers for and want to it on the Big Ten travel to the big house take on Michigan five and one three and on the Big Ten Paul crushed his last just one true road games since coming to Wisconsin as a head coach\nHe was at Michigan in October of twenty sixteen fourteen to seven was that final so we talk about the now Jesse let's talk about the future of these are always big recruiting times and this last weekend Wisconsin had visits in a house in let's talk about to verbal commitment and begin with clay conduct the tight end from Kansas\nHe committed to Wisconsin on Sunday afternoon actually in ... office and I had a chance to talk to play as well as his mom and his high school coach everybody has got a unique different story to to their path to Wisconsin in for him\nIt was interesting because he said when he was a high school freshmen he used to watch Wisconsin on TV and as a tight end he saw how they utilize those guys and thought man that would be really awesome to play there someday well as a junior last season he actually visited for Wisconsin's home game against Michigan took an unofficial visit\nHe helped maybe it would lead to a scholarship offer it did not immediately Wisconsin got a scholarship commitment from hate and root year really talented tight end out of Pennsylvania on February fifth\nAt that point he's kinda like clay is like well I'm probably going to have to move on because he was told there was only one spot for a tight and so he committed to Kansas in June and then to friday's ago Ted Gilmore the wide receivers coach was actually Wichita native\nShowed up at his high school in Wichita, Kansas and told clay we want you to take an official visit and things have changed because Jay when Franklin who was a tight and committed in the last class got moved outside linebacker so that freed up a potential spot for tight end will clay thought this was great if they're asking you to go on an official visit they're paying money for me this means they're probably going to offer\nHe got the offer after the game in the locker room while they're celebrating for Mickey Turner and it took less than twenty four hours to for him to say I'm coming so he flipped his commitment from Kansas to Wisconsin in a big part of that\nKansas obviously not a very good program now they only have one committed player in the class and um he wants to be a part of winning program and know that the coaches are going to be there and I think that's a big selling point of Wisconsin right now you know when ... when you\nTalk about that I I think it's important to to step away from the individuals for a moment\nThese are such exciting times for these kids and their families and it it it I mean it's a it's a load of work that they've put in since they were young teenagers to get to the point of being in that position it can be overwhelming but I see those recruits in the hallway outside the badger locker room on home games\nAnd there's unmitigated joy I mean this isn't it really exciting time in their lives\nIt's a moment that they'll remember forever especially like in that situation when you're getting a scholarship offer in the locker mole everyone celebrating\nAnd you're meeting guys that could be your forever friends it might sound silly but really he he was up there and he had lunch with grammar another Kansas commit that we talked about many many times and I know ... to the now we have the car pool buddy because both those kids are Kansas guys and eight and ... as well to tighten that I mentioned previously so\nYou develop that bond you see who your future teammates could be that are already on the team and for the parents and their coaches it's something that they\nAlso remember forever to big group that was in on Saturday another one that gave a verbal commitment is an offensive lineman a guard Dylan beret from Illinois\nYeah from St Charles Illinois he's six five two Ninety so Wisconsin certainly knows how to pick 'em and I had an opportunity to speak with him and his parents\nAnd his coach as well and the thing that that must be a ... to me and and you can read about this on the athletic is he visited for the game and he had not met Paul Christ and he's on the sideline in his coach said something to one of the graduate assistance you know hey is is there a chance that we could talk to him or meet him or something like that he said let me see what I can do [laughter]\nHe goes out onto the field it's just dealing and Paul Chris with ten minutes before kickoff in Nebraska game hall is on the W. watching the quarterbacks warm up and there's almost eighty thousand people filling the stadium and it's just those two and Paul is having this genuine honest moment with dealing and Dylan is realizing what an incredible thing is is\nThat sealed the deal like you cannot overstate the importance of these game day campus visits he was already pretty sure he wanted to come to Wisconsin with the office of wind tradition but you hear consistently about the coaching staff and the way they treat the players and the fact that Paul would take time out at that moment ten minutes before kickoff\nSays a lot and the other thing I Would say he's the third offensive line committed a ... minute committed in twenty twenty they have three committed players they're all off into blind and then twenty twenty so the badgers are doing things the right way in that class\nWell and and that that the class beyond is these are we're talking about high school juniors right now um but we're also a crunch time for this class because ... it's not what it used to be it's not a February signing date there's a December sunny day coming up which we're talking about two months from now\nAnd the ... build their entire class essentially last December so where do you give us a a kind of a broad scale view of where the ninth skiing class just two months away from sunny day\nBat fourteen committed players right now I think there's probably a few more that they will try and get you know they they have a master\nPlan they probably have a better idea than we do about who's going to be an scholarship or who might not come back and all those types of things\nBut this this December or early signing period is a game changer especially at a place like Wisconsin as I Know we've discussed before they can lock in these commitments early and then if they have one or two available slots afterward can pursue someone that is undecided whereas if you're at Alabama or Ohio State\nYou're constantly going after five star guys and maybe they're committed to Florida or Florida State or maybe they don't know when they're waiting until that last day at Wisconsin you don't necessarily have to worry about that the plan is generally to get everyone signed in December and some of those guys are going to be early enrollees I Know grammar the quarterback is going to be one of them\nI was just going to ask that question and and you answered in advance do do they know and then does it become public about which players will that are verbal will sign officially in December and we'll early enroll ... ...\n... right now I'm sure they have a pretty good idea now all of them aren't set in stone but certainly if you're a high school student you've got to go through your course work and ensure that you graduated early enough that semester early to go to college so it takes a lot of planning and foresight and some guys it's extremely valuable to come in early especially if you're a quarterback to try and learn the system\nSo I think yeah for sure that that happened\nLast year you know white comic or maybe all freshmen team a year ago one of the only badger to be named to the ... and watch lists that are this past summer yet a chance for the Philadelphia fliers development camp\nIt was fun it was a maybe a little longer than most NFL teams ... was about ten days probably average ones like four or five days so\nI learned a lot a it was the hard work has an easy uh\nIt was fun when you go there and it's not really to show them what they know what kind of play large just to learn and\nJust take it all and so it's on\nJust to keep playing a\nRe a they don't really tell you it too much about your past season because they they already know but um there is to go back to work at the plant like last year\nIn college hockey because players can be drafted oftentimes fans think okay this guy's going to be here one year we go to the NHL this guy's going to be here two years and that you consider that at all or you just happy to be where you are right now and let's live at the moment at hand\nOf I'm taking it all and I I Love it here um\nAs I don't think about that at all actually assist\nOr whatever that columns if it does [noise] I'll think about it then but right now in play here Wisconsin focus on that or see\nHim finally for you what what do you think this team can accomplish this year I think back before you got here Tony's first year nobody expected anything in almost made the NCAA tournament\nNobody's expecting much are you guys this yeah yeah I think\nObviously maybe we can look at it like this or restaurants but has to see and we don't look at like we'll look at the rain is I think we have pressure anyway I think obviously those who are maybe some other dogs but I Love it I think those are those guys the ... the sky's the limit for us I think\nMaybe people are a little bit underestimating us to be honest I think we've got some really young good talent so I\nUh I'm not worried about it\nOnce again badger hockey against Boston College this weekend friday and Saturday at the coal center back with our final thoughts as

actually\nTalked about education it's amazing the night before when CNN took him to task and study wasn't negro who didn't read his mother was an English professor his father was the first photo journalist for the Atlanta Journal constitution he lived in China he wrote poetry when he was five years old\nThey took him to task because the vice President Trump and they've just them all night all day talking about is that mother it was heartbreaking\nIt was heartbreaking Charles paid business executive professional I asked the Fox Business Network and and despite the fact that nobody died Geraldo still found a way in to the story this way\nHe was the darling of the liberal left in two thousand and five when he said George W. Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handles Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing the president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys in the eyes shut and all and I should've known Geraldo told\nTrump to get Kanye West and Erin Jim Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know that Geraldo did bring up a uh something I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted\nBlacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave and they go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane\nAnd that Bush was responsible for the levees being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up but it was Kanye West\nSo can you hear all kinds of crab back then in two thousand five rip it in the Bush they loved him but\nThe love was sleeping obviously be right back\nTo Russia ... where he was going to come\nWhen my cardiologist told me I needed to take a stab rump to lower my cholesterol he also told me that it can lower my natural levels of co Q. ten [noise] he told me to take ... it has the number one cardiologist recommended form of co Q. ten a very important nutrient\nFor healthy heart and healthy blood pressure levels with three times better absorption has the\nNumber one cardiologist recommended form of ... take to know the better cook you tend\nTo not ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the interview women in the me too movement call you a supporter\nOf no question off limits you're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has just put a strain on your marriage tonight what will Milan even Trump say let's talk about the jacket this\nWhy did you wear being Milan the ABC exclusive\nEvent don't miss it tonight at ten nine central on ABC\nAll of October there's no trick just to treat when you buy tires at Middleton for treat one take advantage of their tier price match guaranteed three too with the purchase of four tires you get a ... not a good balance a treat brief retire rotations for life great October ...

James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign in his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people that tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing\nThat people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe and the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them off oh why do we get to the tape on sentiment today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut then when they get there and here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump they're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time\nBecause that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering solutions and the answers and solving problems\nAnd the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years\nIs in jeopardy and you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they would save stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nAnd he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in creating factories manufacturing centers here and\nTell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what Kanye was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I give me an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of ... a fence\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties like there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system anyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right\nInto the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and\nAnd she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you thank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe but given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program it\nJust works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows in the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human\nOur human family in town or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs are making the things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know the is they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that it's downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be\nAfrican American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vile thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when negroes don't read flat folks\nAren't that since he just praying Kanye West and the racial draft now the sudden Kanye because he put on a mad hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the models spokes person he's he's the token negro of that of the Trump administration's\nThis was an embarrassment Conyers mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think when you had Vera man is clearly not OK and a president who is willing to point that\nWas a combination of fame of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ... and a commercial for Donald Trump\nOn the question of of of mental health on the question of other pointing ham I felt very point and to me that was something very fragile about ... and sad about tiny pulling out of the phone and translate type can't as colorfully outside I think for their own calling up somewhere picture of a car [laughter]\nOn that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on

got six minutes you know I Want to talk about house races oh yeah sure let's let's it's right doom and gloom and if the end of the world as we know at its what but is it\nWhere would you be but here's what they're sixty races the countries that are competitive or within the margin of error or highly you're better which means for points or less\nOf those sixty races the Democrats would forty of the Republicans role wells by one see if if the Democrats win thirty five twenty five Republicans ... eleven soda to lose control the house you have to lose\nForty one of those sixty\nTo rejoin Nineteen forty one\nNow given the recent surge generally GOP base that has become no very alert if you move the resolution which Republican pollster has the ... ... even\n... even compared to was fourteen other polls two months ago so it's very typical so appeal to forty one above sixty\nI think so if you ... and ... and by the way is no longer Scott Rasmussen resumes in polling is now separate from Scott Rasmussen he sold it um he's doing polling again and he's kind of much pretty much saying the same thing you are\nUm there's tracking poll that's been going at is an ongoing in these competitive districts and there are not these dramatic shifts its it's considered a horse race\nBut if you look at the tracking poll in these districts it never looked like a blue wave it looks like the possibility if the Democrats had everything go their way of what they can create a way\nWhere you are winning forty five for sixty forty five of sixty you'd be a a twenty four you'd be you'd go to net gain of twenty four why don't you by saying they're going to do that now\nThat that was but that was the that was the headline that was in and if you only look at the generic ballot you only look at\nThat number and that number has fluctuated very dramatically over the last two months then we go from headlines of there's a blue wave to headlines if there's no way that like there is a blue wave headline there's I'm right\nThere with ... away from miles British and\nThe Senate right now is looking like the the Democrats lose I think what seven that they needed to defend why\nWell uh you know have Joe Donnelly I'm In trouble in the ... the coda I can be done um you know even McCaskill is a close race Missouri or Arizona is looking a little better for the ... point but you're you're possibly going to ... for your for\nThose are good chance of that if you're the general beside even if you if you lose the house\nWe lose our struggle salads right so\nHe may have an even stronger majority in the Senate I'm so in terms of Republican strength\nLosing miles is that a done deal by\nThe before count on the Democrats actually part of their Kavanaugh strategy was this sort of a long shot idea that they could take control of the Senate if this was part of their strategy 'em and they and they blew it not only do they blow not only did they make it so that there is\nAmericans you know we're going to come back with a bare bare majority they made it possible for the Republicans to probably come back plus three or maybe even more\nAnd all because they couldn't than it was the one thing you can always trust about the the radical progress is when the radical progress as decide when the Democrats decided radical progressive they're going to be there they're guiding North Star out\nThere is no such thing as too much for them right there is they cannot stop themselves amber they will always push it as has been banned madness in the eighties added none that beyond\nWe'd better for somebody to uh that's when you know we would round round the convention but wouldn't cheat Richard Daley but to venture\nOut George McGovern was numbers him give a speech to am but here's

James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign in his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people at tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing\nThat people have zero truth\nOr or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh why do we get to the tape on cinema today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester\nIs they can't be honest with who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump they're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's our first boat and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time\nBecause that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering solutions and answers and solving\nProblems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy and you're going to get endless investigation\nPossible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stayed in\nPublicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nTell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother currently should run in a horrible economic difficulties is like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison if the President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows in the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human\nOur human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can\nDo better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs are making the things in America and creating jobs in America you know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright\nRacist and disgusting why is it\nMatter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political
