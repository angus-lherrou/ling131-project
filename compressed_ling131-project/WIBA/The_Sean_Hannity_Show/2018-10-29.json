because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that\nAnd we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together about protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans\nLike to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that the minute but you don't remember when Bernie Sanders\nIt one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field and nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time it was far worse that was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm a I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him and I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House when Obama was president and as it did it came up a number of times I have a number of\nTape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\n\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because\nUm there's this idiot on fake news CNN is named my ... what's his name John ... somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part ... when he but basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Sean Hannity says had direct language ... may have we don't we don't know who is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the country of ... which is not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes\n... Robert De Niro is calling the president devil and us devil worshippers effect you know I'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the other campaigns bin ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a pig is a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care\nThinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country it makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald Trump [noise]\n... what are we talking about\n[noise]\nIdiot and the ... gonna [noise]\n\nStick around is really at all here but I imagine you know him talking about the president wanting a punch the president in the face you would think CNN would agree with me that that's incendiary rhetoric or those that want to dream of blowing up the White House and I got a whole montage I'm going to put together\nYou know this this is so close to slander this is right there on the line and I have my lawyers looking at it right now because I Am not you know it's all over the top you would have ... you would think that John Avalon would join me\nIn saying Robert Deniro Z incendiary rhetoric of wanting to punch the president is a threat to the president of the United states\nAnd frankly that's something I think the secret service should have looked into\nBut I have a history of saying we ought to protect all our president's words\nMake people do things I think it's been irresponsible Maxine Waters and company to get in people's faces and create crowds in and gas stations in department stores and restaurants that new tell them they're not wanted here anywhere anymore\nAnd that CNN has been critical how dare people like Hannah they call it a mob their silence has been definitely and we'll get to all of this today and\nUh we're eleven days from election day eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program\nYou know it is so crazy what do you do for your home and your family to protect your home

about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter and and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the president up punk a dog a pig a con a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nI Want to punch him in the face\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out the calls for violence against the president that frankly is the right thing to do why didn't he joined me as a question he needs to answer\nAs the red light just like CNN with the mobs we've been witnessing you can't even say the word mob when you watch women and children being run at a restaurant it's been conservatives that have been saying this got this has got to stop\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob how you're not going to use them I totally a mob it is without a doubt that we're now if it wasn't going to put up a non stop that his mom and dad have\n... we already did that were already said they weren't mobs no it's not my writing for people who

imagine these words used by any conservative during the Obama years or the Clinton years\nIf you're a person of good will like I Am you deplore violence of any kind we can settle our political differences at the ballot box eleven days\nAnd when you call out fake news for what it is that is not\nIn any way so I Need to be clear for stupid people that want to purposely misinterpret words of people when you call them out for having an agenda for being fake and phony and fraudulent that is just telling the truth that they don't wanna hear\nOr when you point out that they spent basically every second of every minute of every hour of every day demonizing a president trying to de legitimize a duly elected president\nWhen people say that they care about the truth first and they say they really want to get to the bottom of Trump Russia collusion and Russia collusion at all or Russian influence at all and totally and completely and utterly ignore\nThe candidate of their choice obvious

by the way he hated\nTrump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact that President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people\nAnd then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no ... as long as there's a you know bad word of a quote in ... infestation but\nDespite those facts you have people you know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe

apparently a you know as\nRon ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these burial an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the

had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about the gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter would you prefer that there are ... you know that there are trained professionals\nIn that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion

on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people or getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says\nWhy is there this anger out there that we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and

hurt\nAnd I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nWhen President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened we've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch\nThe Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre\nOn President Trump\nLook if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they lie and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people\nAnd then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you\nKnow bad word of a quote in ... infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what does he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting all linked to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do with Trump\nOh no it's unbelievable how they now believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in the Daily Caller today and he's been a a\nPassionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said the day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd then went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Farrakhan they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him but now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with ferret conference con one of the greatest purveyor of anti some medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not
