I mean you've been covering extensively for a long time now that that that the writers and targeted and I think it's appalling what any American when any citizen when any person feels threatened attack potential pilots and I think we've got to stop and and the reaction as you pointed out\nAt one staffer saying that she's going to be meeting Heidi Heitkamp a super liberal after the midterms\nIn other words she's purposely lying again to the people of North Dakota staffer saying she's acting moderate only to get votes and high camp staffers want people to think that she's for the wall and she's not for the wall and saying that if there is a blue wave show move left\nAnd saying that their staff are saying Trump will be impeached if the Democrats win the Senate but of course she's not seeing any of this publicly listening election\n\n\nWorkers [noise]\nShe was running but she was\nGood for\nShe wanted to get elected when they didn't really liberal she's German way\nFrom the world\nI don't like the shoe bomber posted on\nOur own when that's my that's my favorite picture that\nAway in young ... year okay\nNot\nA\nHe's not coming to an a to a campaign for us either\nOn the line\nFrom what I can tell it's back to you know you're very\nRepublican I had my like I Am now and yeah it's like\nPeople\n\nA while\nIn\nThe end of this the same same thing with a with Claire\nLewis explained to me and now we're just trying to do because it makes people fall out here\nSo don't say she I supported the wall active or whatever\nOn the ground saying okay because I just add this something or yeah or like making people go somewhere in the wall and the other day I don't know you know for that so I don't say that she doesn't\nWant them to kind of ... people don't really understand why then\nIt'd be like they're going to look at me while I\nWas on the wall or what have you on the one who has all the border from ...\nNo she do vote against the wall [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] you know\nWhat to\nDo in that\nWay [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd then you'll be able to support them\nAnd they might be like I don't know the amazing\nThis is now number three British send a phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and\nWashington DC campaign office at speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states to get elected\nWhich so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly in the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people\nTennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the cast school have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying\nIt's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this is what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone I mean these are three big huge massive\nSenate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected but I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party\nWe now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's good\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that well that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and ... may I suggest have integrity\nThis is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they could only make one choice one\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there was an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project their ties\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none at it it it comes to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nAnd how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nLosing lines in the\nGold used up GM's coins is paying top prices for gold silver coins jewelry and more for surely silver forks and spoons gyms co pays twenty

we've got to monitor the media close the here because they're not talking about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI think yeah I I I think you should give it a little bit\nI you know we got we got something happened in the southwest and the southeast and the thing that's

long and so you know I thought that that was one area was you know like he's got all these Segway as we got to be more and more and and are you guys just kept playing and and that was probably a lot of the effort and the responses to different situations it's a\nBig part of this team this year and it seems like all the last few is that they do these things aren't going well I mean there's you know some some days and it's been pretty rare here it just doesn't just yawn but more and more often than not there's not a panic mode they just keep function and then things break\nFor yeah and and and I think that even those there's been a couple of like you said that you keep punching and then maybe you don't landed or get through to them but they keep going and that's a I think it's a group that\nSays like playing the game and I think they really do care about each other and so they're gonna they don't want to be that week Lincoln and [noise]\nYou know the game of football and any sports you know you've got to the times become timely when you got to make a play if you want\nTo change feel positions or or you don't make those when you look back at it that was a play that help to win the game and so our guys or wherever they do they like plane and and they'll continue to play and I think they like playing with each other and I'm forty so\nIt was kind of unique to take away she had to answer the roster representative or the fifth year CNN or whatever by backing us access hampered screw freshman playing that folks got involved in that turnover festival second quarter saw it\nAnd then you know of course we all want to solve the you know one of the text to come from leaving of course you have all that and then there were some great effort plays you know I think\nThere was another play the bunny ... punch the ball we didn't get it but we'll turn over his don't just happen or takeaways don't just happen to get those words ... there was another great picture Chris shore does tell them flying in and he's on the ground and on the quarterback gets up and he and see\nSoldiers about twenty yards and recovered so it's just a guys playing and uh when you get those sometimes we've all she has to take away can be contagious you know you get one and they get to learn\nTo steal your plan to go on but you know what you just gotta keep playing and I guess you would be for this week you know\nWe haven't shoots couple of games recently we haven't been great all parents taking care of the ball you don't remember the one in teen grid five [noise] uh they're your last last year we start and then we got a completion phone bill you know we got to try to make sure that we do a good job of taking care of it and then if we can\nStill one or two because it's a it's a good team are playing against you got to be able to take care of the football and then you try to steal some of\nThe chance to talk to relieve and it was the matter does it get a lot of grief are going to the house\nOther heck of a knack for that to I got a really I just want you to go on and go right down you know but\nI don't I don't think that a lot of guys there's a few selected that can go ahead and give him a little bit of a hard time but not ... yeah that was just kind of know where you're at who you're talking to and appreciate that he did get picked for your hands faster\nThere he's got it

before the cold is one of the show or for part of what they are student athletes whose guys come out [noise] in this case many of them are in both parties\nEnjoyed right well that's the best part about it and and uh our guys have been great and I think probably like with all vying because someone\nImpacted them and just like a big variety of doing that and it's a citizen a part of the players come I Love having one of the players come out to the show and then other people for\nOur players actually the best part about twelve and a former quarterbacks high school quarterback and it's a two year old Ryan and and getting [noise]\nTwo of the most fascinating guys to me and and couldn't have more respect and really not only their journeys but how they approach each day and it is a [noise] it's been fun for me to be around and to see it in\nThe evolution of of Ryan and then you're going out and engaged during needle going to happen to transfer to go to junior college in common and love seeing how it is kind of come with the players are players accepted him and he's one of those and feels like he's been here for four or five years in a way down\nThe path is different for everybody that so you know not everybody just comes in a bank here it is it all falls into place both the sample of stay with it and yeah it's Austin or it's\nAwesome Holly each guys path is different just like Ryan and then when he didn't even ... high school program that he was\n... and so he was playing quarterback and therefore you're not going to play 'em at Lima and there's other kids in school and\nAnd I look at it and then I'd make an argument he's one of the best linebacker certainly other countries are the conference of the country and and I'm looking forward as is and who gets healthier because there is a guy that we see it when you tell them prizes and invented enough games you know healthy gangsters really good for the\nLast season of those big games you play the end of the year fall\n... that's why I'm I'm Glad that he's getting healthier and healthier and and uh [noise] he's a he's always fun to watch like\nYou know we talk about guys who are banged up but it's a good story to have to see a guy like Andrew wars were through that and others who have fought their way factors such Taiwan deal the case this year I Know we've mentioned that quite a bit if it's a lot of butter really really good stories with this team right now is getting ready to\nSit down at Northwestern and it's you know are making I every year we didn't reply northwest and we always talk about how much we enjoy being with\nMy hand towards when he was four days are here for a couple of years to defense there with guys who you know the couple of them for is to start to put our little\nWords together for them for\nFor our purposes advantage guys have been around for a while and then you realize like fatty fish for them to forty who's played a year and a half for college credit ... ...\nYou know I think there is just out of ... down lineman and lead against a lot of last year and then they had a good run of linebacker in it I think they've got that and um [noise] you know I [noise] like you guys you know I was really appreciative of the time that I did spend with with Hank and\nAnd we were recording ... time in the fashion and I got up going in and talking football with women\nAnd we'd have a good exchanges events so\nFeel what he's doing that is a great balance one that I respect and he kind of admire him that he truly has feel based philosophy and yet there's enough change ups come off of that than I Do see the players and they understand his ...\nAnd uh but he's just one of the good guys and football [noise] it's a heck of a cold she don't she don't like him just because he's a good guy like him because he's a guy and [noise]\nTo professional admitted it had a ton of experience with what\nHe's seen over the place for bowed to hang up or they are involved in decades he's covered\nYou know he's a he's he's a lot of respect for pat says terrible then you've got to get to know him more and more each year and he's a he's a classy guys because those who that's the team you want to be\nTalking about someone else seems like he's been around forever though ... yeah thirty five years old and I still goes well\n... and really a good good player hit on in all the different ways you know I think that certainly talented arm strength\nIn size but his is tough to send you one thing that you know I just want to wait until they use in and say forty six start it will be zero yeah I mean he's seen probably every different way to\nAttack the girl that she would try to defend him and and so um that's a good challenge for these sort of made\nIt work I Know the run again is you know Jeremy Oregon had to retire [noise]\nUm because of injury very promising stop or running back and I I Know the statistics are not pretty but yet last week to here's some freshmen named thousand or who had to carry up until last week in any Russia's for a hundred\nAnd Jamie and Anders than the sun Damien enters the late nineties or two thousand right his son is a running back so there is kind of like the badgers here they're finding ways you guys get banged up but the next man up for flies everywhere\nThey are and and I also give them credit for it probably was goes who they had a running back to the last couple of years but that was a big part of their office and then to be able to make that adjustment a lot of credit to them\nFor still really keep it within their off and they didn't say reinvent the wheel but there are changing how they're doing it and now\nYou know it was another dimension when all that physical games before all they're going to do is just the kind of got that go on and so it's a player said it'll be a good challenge for the Senate\nAnd also for office you keep it will keep them off the field and so that should come as you full circle back to the you know what a team and we got to play football and we got to complement each other and and uh you know you're going up against a well coach self esteem and then it's going to be a ... game even though there are spread\nIs going to be a ... game whoever can be the most physical really feel mentally and physically tough as you get a big part of the civilians or it'll be contested very\nSimilar to your program got a blue ... this is what they do with rice who they are and then they recruit accordingly and you see the system that they have a voice whatever it is it's maybe different yeah of course it is but I think the bottom of the foundation of what's the strongest right hands of police and every one of its size\nSo I think I think you're exactly right and in different ways we're maybe similar it's just like Iowa you know different ways I think there's some similarities and and I said [noise]\nYou know those are going to try to play this game that you know don't give it to him and you know how do you how do you want to beat the opponent you don't want to give them anything they make them these you know so it's a I think we approach it\nSimilarly like you said different ways but the fundamental beliefs and foundational are probably pretty much of my\nGood programs that are you know very evenly matched series now for the last twenty five thirty years so looks hard thanks for your time or look for ...\nAnd the warm up act is done and over again I'm going to\nGo to go as you said George ball grows badgers fans it's football season remember to
