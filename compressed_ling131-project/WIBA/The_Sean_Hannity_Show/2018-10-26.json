alter slightly but Wisconsin's game plan would have been to attack north western on the ground in the first place right\nYeah there's no question about it this team that's where they thrive they run the ball forty times in the game and I would expect if you have a backup in there that's what you're going to do again but there are going to be occasions where you have to have your quarterback make it through I think Jack is fully capable of it now the public hasn't necessarily seen it I've only seen it in small doses during spring practice or fall camp\nAnd again we haven't had an opportunity to watching practiced in the middle of August so you don't know what his growth looks like from that point until now but I think ... is asked to do that in small doses that he can do that\nHuman nature from a fan standpoint unless the quarterbacking play is outstanding fans have a want to see the backup\nSo it appears that they may get that want a which can also create issues that's why you likely don't go there and the first place but\nUm you know if if Wisconsin plays well and jak Cohn is the quarter back then there is a little ... than they are a this is more talk show driven which is what we're doing right now but it is more talk driven\nThan to have that fan base say see right I mean that's a that's a potential um offshoot of\nThis so it is and and again that is a hypothetical but I'm I'm Glad you're bringing up this topic because this week I wrote a story about\nAlex ... broke that attracted a lot of conversation on all ends of the spectrum and at that point of course not knowing that the situation that we're in at this point\nIt was about the criticism that he continually receive and whether that's fair or not and I said that there was a fine line between saying that Alex needs to play more consistent football which I think we can agree on that that should be the case and then saying that somebody else has\nTo be better than him or I think that's human nature to see one person's flaws and assume that the next guy wouldn't have those laws because you don't know what he'll provide\nThat personal lives own set of laws and and so for your right those people that have said we'll put jak cone and give him an opportunity if this does indeed transpire then you're going to see what he's about and if you play as well\nYeah it's never great to have a quarterback discussion I wouldn't go as far as controversy but uh if he does play well it it's going to make things interesting and it would be hard to nice to deny somebody who can come in in that type of scenario uh and and play to that level but again total speculation at this yeah if we go back three\nYears the last time there was really any a significant controversy discussion about who should be playing barred Houston ... last time you really had\nA two quarterback situation where somebody said um well this guy should be in in this scenario\nYeah well two years ago Barton Alex ... time

parental it's been a little time with the Jesse temple the athletic dot com as we roll on on this Thursday edition of badger prime\nOr a really ... and you and I talked about both on and off the air about the piece you were putting together on Jim Leonard\nSo you went up to his home town a hundred and Thirteen people strong a in a Tony, Wisconsin we went to high school limbo and um ... let's start at the storyline where you're taking a picture of the sign that brings you into his home town\nOf that was put up a little bit more than a decade ago or so and take me through that storyline\nThere's a sign that the outskirts of town that was probably the most famous sign for miles around and it says welcome to Tony, Wisconsin hometown of Jimmy Leonard walk on to all American I spent two days there the first day I walked around town talked to locals went to the high school is it had where gyms dad worked at a lumber yard\nAnd then the next morning before I left town I just there was something that compels me to go back to the sign because quite honestly I thought I Would never be back to Tony\nA you know it's kind of a one time thing and I'm standing there taking some notes on the signing this red pickup truck pulls up right next to me and there's a guy Darren from the passengers dire stemmed from the driver's seat through the roll down passenger side window and I had no idea who he was\nAnd I went up to him and started talking to him and I told them what I was doing\nAnd he just kind of smiled and he told me that he was the person responsible for having the sign created Thirteen Years earlier and\nHis his uh his name is Carol he the Seventy three years old and he was the guy that I was looking to talk to like I was probably going to call them afterwards that Tony for you at such a small town or might find universe um anyway he so he kind of became the basis for the opening of my story is or why does this sign matter so much and it's not so much about\nJim's accomplishments which they obviously celebrate on that signed but it's the way he's gone about it with his humility and the fact that he never thought even though he will has me never thought he was better than other people on the field he just he wanted his teammates to be involved he didn't see himself as\nThis this great person and I think that goes a long way and you're seeing that reflected in the way that he coaches and the approach that he has with his players\nJim Leonard doesn't seek the spotlight isn't seek the camera doesn't speak to the microphone but we do get a chance to talk with him he he can be very ... he's a very good interview we know is accomplishments you can read his ... you can see those things but what did you learn maybe about him where\nHe came from how it got there that maybe you weren't so certainly before\nWell you said how down to earth he is and and he is an extremely insightful interview 'em and you wouldn't know obviously that he's a football player and that's probably been said many times because he's he's by they basically my height um but just\nThe way he talked about Tony and the way that growing up there shaped him that if if he was going to consider doing something that wasn't on the right path\nHe was going to hear about it and probably for multiple people in town so they kept him in line and those values um made him able to thrive at Wisconsin because he said he basically grew up in a fishbowl yeah you're in Tony and there's a hundred plus people but everyone's paying attention to what you're doing because you're the best athlete there\nYou're the coaches kid and so when he got to Wisconsin even though they're eighty thousand people in the stands he felt like he'd been preparing for that and so I thought that was kind of interesting and just in general why Wisconsin matters to him so much because he sees a lot of the same values that he grew up with he feels like this is a university where they do things right and\nIt's not just on the field it's off the field and it's in the way they recruit here's a here's a short story I put this in into my story but I thought this was really instructive of who gym is that\nHe held the camps every year back in Tony when he was an NFL player for high school players and for youth and he was talking to his former coach in the tent I was talking to is former coach about this Darryl guy goes kind of a legendary coach out there and Darryl was asking him about his future what his career would be as a coach\nAnd Jim said he didn't really know but if he was going to go somewhere and it was going to be in college he wanted to go somewhere where he didn't have to lie to recruit to satisfy the desires of coaching staff I think that was very important to him I think that's part of the reason he's at a place like Wisconsin because he feels like he can do it right\nWell I think this part is interesting too because the because of what he was doing and the way he did it he skipped a bunch of steps from being a player to a pretty high level position in a very short period of time\nThat usually happens because of aptitude on what you learn when you were a player how much you apply what you learned and how you can then communicate that because he really did he skipped a bunch of steps and is that the uh he's highly compensated and he's out of high level in college\nFootball well he's been a teacher of the game ... pretty much before he knew he was a teacher of the game and he talked about this as well in the story I mean when you grow up and you're the son of a coach\nHe will be watching basketball games on TV with his dad and he said you're not looking at the basket that was ... he said well how the heck that the guy get open for the shot right and so he is dad told me he would be teaching like girls on the playground in elementary school how to shoot a basketball and football coach said in junior high he would be telling the defensive backs\nWhere to line up and it's coach told me Jim always had a way of doing it that\n... didn't insult a player didn't make them feel like they were inferior so you're right there was a natural aptitude he was the coach on the field in the NFL he took a lot of younger players under his wing even though some of the younger players could take is playing time he didn't see it like that he he was all about\nThe team in and eat it translated as a coach I was talking to Scott Nelson who is one of the state the air and he said he\nHad a teacher in high school had a a mechanical engineering degree from West Point smartest guy but he couldn't translate what he knew that the students and he said but coach Leonard is able to do that I think that is huge and coach Leonard always says that football is a simple game complicated by men\nUm I think that's a good way to look at it and Leonard is able to simplify it or the players\nLess quit saw it on on Jessie a temples piece on Jim Leonard that ran in the athletic dot com earlier this week and I'm like you to go join the athletic dot com you will enjoy so much that is they're not just done Jesse's work but others as well\nUm but what about stability for Jim Leonard here now he chose to come back home home being Madison even though he's from the northern reaches of the state this is home built a house here has kids and his wife\n... what is the did you get any ... on on what the future is\nAsked him specifically about that because as we know he had opportunities to go elsewhere late last season of Florida State or Alabama Texas than I Am all at least express some interest and he's obviously still at Wisconsin\nHe said that it goes back to those values he wants to be at a university where he feels like they do things the right way and\nFor that reason he said that if he stays at Wisconsin for an extended period of time he's totally okay with that\nAnd I do think there is something to be said for happiness again he want it to be in Madison he and his wife they built a house they have three young kids this is a place that matters to him because of the way the people are and that matches the weight eat these things\nAnd if you're capable of going a lot of places absolutely but if he's happy here I think obviously that's great for ... fans because the number one question you hear about 'em is how long can Wisconsin keep them in based\nOn my conversation with him is perfectly content here for the time being\nAll right very good a great piece that Jesse put together hope you go out and read it as well we'll continue it is John audience that will step in and joins we'll talk a little badger women's volleyball big weekend last weekend and and some big wigs you have to come here or Wisconsin

whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this is a project maritime project they started saying

their lives or when it's a Republican that look here's here's just the truth that they will never tell\nThey care about only Donald Trump Russia collusion with\nAll the evidence that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies disseminated them to you we the people in the lead up to the election that those Russian paid for lives of Hillary were used as the bulk of information presented to you know for Pfizer court judges\nThat the that predicated the entire Russia which ... which was the pony bought and paid dot CA of Hillary Clinton from with Russian lives they only care they only care if it's Trump Russia\nThey don't care about anything else you know if you look at the cabinet situation oh Kevin all we need an FBI investigation these allegations are horrible\nNone of those people that demanded an FBI investigation into nearly forty year old allegations some of them so far fetched from reality they never once demanded an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd this is in within the last year with evidence with tapes with text messages with doctors reports uh nobody that was demanding the cabin or treatment for cabinet ever demanded of for Ellison\nOr the recent report over the weekend about Cory Spartacus Booker\nOr Claire McCaskill's husband and allegations made against him or when he was married to his first wife I mean if that's the standard none of them asked for the Clintons to have this Bill Clinton to go through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left to the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all ... minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after

going to have to stick with me here in trust my my instincts on on being patient is gonna be all kinds of time next week or whatever when this stuff continues to break and [noise]\nWhatever all happens um I I I appreciate the call I Know what you're saying Susan over half of America gets more in welfare than it pays in tax I should save this for next week you realize these this is congressional budget office numbers\nMore than half of Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer pay but Medicare Medicaid food stamp Social Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half\nOne thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big deal\nIf your life is dependent on all kinds of government transfer payments welfare whatever you want to call it and\nTax cuts you think are going to lead to the government having less money then you're not going to be in favor of tax cuts all we've got half over half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes\nThey're gonna understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon\nFor the Republicans in polling that's a major shift just since the Nineteen eighties there was a huge win win for Republicans back in the eighties and I think it still is to a certain extent but\nNot as big Frank in in

guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that the minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve Scully so the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid\nSupporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and as it did it came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAmericans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and he was when I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong\nFeelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um\nThere's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to the near wrote to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nIs Sean Hannity says had direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between them\nAttacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative jets yeah which is not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes Trump Robert De Niro is calling the president devil an a devil worshippers effect you know\nSomebody is being absolutely insane ... you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders and he shot up Republicans on a ball field and Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar they've gone\nDeep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the Clintons there nobody that's Keith Ellison or Cory Booker\nIt's always hypocrisy [noise]\nYou know you look at the hearing ... who's been warning that horrible things are going to happen if the rhetoric doesn't come down with me are the most part\nCNN and these other networks have been silent when Republicans are confronted

doubt about it we have kids going around everywhere it's in the dark\nBut I\nWe've dealt with it fairly successfully over the years and I think we'll continue to do so safety is an issue I get it\nMost children they say don't carry flashlights well out on Halloween Night the group warns well sixty five percent don't discuss Halloween safety with their children\nThe bigger problem is that with younger kids in particular we have parents who say where\nAre their Jimmy [laughter] see it back here at the ranch every of fill up your your a Jack o lantern bucket there man\nI'm going to finish watching those World Series\nGame [noise] that's problematic and when we have are kids who are really young men and young women Fifteen sixteen Seventeen years old going out trick or treating

just somebody somewhere has to mess with something\nAgain don't don't you think there is a bit of a profit motive involved with the\nHalloween industry association pushing this\nThose or they would

D that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters [noise] we have confirmed this fingerprint is at ... or say uh [noise]\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected\nFrom pieces of two different\nHigh eighties mailed in separate envelopes sample previously\nCollected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure under an incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and Ali would but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab\nFor their work and keeping people safe helping us to find the individual responsible [noise]\nWe also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation\nOf this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work [noise] I also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain\nOn high alert every to try to keep the American people safe\nAnd who move quickly and efficiently into action [noise]\nEvery single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now [noise]\nAnd other packages [noise]\nOf everyone out there every citizen\nEveryone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in

could be the one that leads to something very important [noise]\nThen of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities\nWe need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work along everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nOf protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans\nTo turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from Iraq\nTo re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause ah you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but you don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle\nAnd I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported and uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid\nSupporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans\nAnd Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him and I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House when Obama was\nPresident and there's a there came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said\nMr Speaker is you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately has become a pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot on fake news CNN\nHis name I ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years and I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Sean Hannity says had a direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative just because you know it's not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... Robert De Niro calling the president of devil in a devil worshippers it affect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so lately [noise] stupid he's a\nPunk his dog he's a big he's a con artist mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald Trump [noise]\nWhat are we talking about\n[laughter]\n[noise] idiots [laughter]\nSee the point John Deere hockey\nUsed by the U.S illegally or where you'll get national coverage in the middle of anywhere from our luggage energy community connections using our energy for good in the community we used to her and by aids hardware don't miss ... to ... hardware\nWhere your bedroom here and get twenty percent off\nOn the eve of free press signed the puck dropped inside the call center to start Madison is the biggest party\nAnd renew one of the most played match up steam badger hockey history good evening from inside the American family insurance broadcast alongside the costume less than paradigm Rob although in horror Brian post today\nExcited to bring you all the action for this series open or the one hundred and fifty gave all time meeting between the fourteenth rank badgers\nAnd Michigan Tech hub fees wants WC ha rivals now meeting cutting non conference series the ...\nComing up a split on the road last week in their first road trip for the year they lost that corks in in the opener and they don't want on Saturday nights seven and won at St Lawrence they felt for the two Carson on friday got both ... in action and got a good when on Saturday bounce back\nWe'll talk about that we'll preview this match up with the huskies will hear from coaches and talk about this series for the badgers before they have a tough stretches non conference late and then get into Vegas had an accident before the holiday break\nThe young badger team getting an important victory last weekend [noise] try to continue and build off that momentum here on a whole life\nThis weekend again the Michigan Tech huskies will even asking for a quarter to about this a rivalry with tech if she's got a story to share about the hot these days as part of its badger program as well\nWe'll have all that much more we'll start with the badgers head coach Tony gr NATO when we return on the free game show here inside the American family insurance broadcast booth badger hockey firmly airfield\nSunday factor is going to take on the LA ran\nWhy he a\nHigh mark ins or you're carrying the windows from Marvin not vinyl you know the plastic windows with would dream stickers that war cracker fade over time\nSchedule your in home free estimate today windows roofing signing a bath said games or company dot com [noise]\nReally want to screw up and I wanted to make sure she drinks you want to we went online and like look ring or a bunch of places in Madison and middle ... and ... was actually the most highly rated one on the website and we didn't want to go to\nMany chains almost jewelers is actually the perfect place for us to check out the ring and\nShe was very surprised engagement rings no wedding vans custom made a ... one of ...

guessing that got a pretty good about your team especially the way they bounce back on Saturday getting that when seven to one yeah we we last\nFriday we put a good team against Clarkson a mayor and the victory with the game was on the line two two and a third and they uh they made the you know more plays than we did towards the end the game so give them credit they're good team there'll be a rank theme\nThroughout the year so I'm like you said the response Saturday was standing as soon as the game started on Saturday we were in control of it really from the first shift on it and it's a\nYou know our young kids provided the energy older guys were great a lock on making sure we were already and it was a great team effort to come up with some of the one one\nOne of those players that's gotten off to a great start provided some edited energy Doogie by goals already what have you seen for him this year there's a lot of them have the access in the production well I think he's just\nMaturity I think the first year when you come in college hockey [laughter]\nYou know and your goals scored you want to contribute immediately and that's a big step and undersized we all know that\nUm and last year which was one of those years where he played well for us he didn't contribute often simply maybe as much as ... as we thought he might or in the ... for sure as much as he thought he would and and this year he is a come in a in great shape he did a lot of things over the summer to train to get ready and uh\nYou know he's earned it like these goals aren't\nYou know from the point that there are there not cheesy goal of their their goals that are down there in the paint worries paying a price score goals and and for a little guy to be able to be as courageous as he had to get to those areas do at night after night just shows you kind of hard he has and and you know be able to score five laws and four games as it was\nA great start and uh you know if he keeps going the same ways going in the obviously is going to be a big part are often struck here\nThat one of the biggest adjustments for any of these players they come to the college level that used to be in the high school or junior ranks wind up and down the ice storm beautiful goals you know highlight reel type goals but now you've got to get to the dirty bought the top spot and get more of those grinder type goals because of the other goals don't come as easily yeah I I\nThink every level you go up you have new challenges on how to be productive at the next level and [noise] but I think that's certainly a a\nYou know what you mentioned the defense or bigger here uh\nTeams are have more decisive concepts on how to box out and protect their net front let their goal is to the park so so yeah you know jumping from where you know like you said junior high school to college hockey is a huge step for for learning how to pay a price to to get to those areas and\nYou know I'm looking at our other freshmen this year and and look at look at Mercer ... shot a cough field all of that for freshmen and that have come in and play and they have that grid that mentality and knowing where those dirty or a jar and willing to pay those prices so so they're not all uh you know\nOver the steel players standpoint like you said that they're going to walk down the rink and beat the defense and and then they could bring well what a goalie they're going to score a lot of goals and create a lot of often an advocate player the yard to play against because\nThey understand that part of the game so I think that the maturity and an end to the Britain attitude that that group has just been a big contributor to to the early success that we've had\nMore with the badgers head coach in two
