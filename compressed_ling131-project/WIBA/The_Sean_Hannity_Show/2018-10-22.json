as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters\nAnd the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in

to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen ...\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of

assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that there is a very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this was that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying

hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ... ads by Jeff deal was born well she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week\nWell it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThey and tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer ill identity politics of the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H.

reports Trump's approval jumps ahead of all Hama is or Obama's at this point in time and Obama's presidency and remember Obama had the full support\nAnd then you've got a case that allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's\nHusband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nIf you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida it'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know Ron dissent this about it a great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent\nBusiness tax that Gillum would support Gillum is use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nHe's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett a sit in the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett is it is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he's not that he's a moderate to liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in\nMissouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice costs\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we're borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary that we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing him a throwing those out the the door of the restaurant now it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one\nAn option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy\nTo buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine to literally subsidize the sick the elderly and\nAnd the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year a and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack but\nThe anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with the party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen competitive races to capture control the chamber\nIt's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema I mean it's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support\nIt skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave and sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs of the midterms\nAre much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Rhonda Santa's becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black or ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him where I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly\nA problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nMike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as him leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and and we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got of course the hypocrisy so we got the cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\nYou've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans it's where you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now services

Mexican newspaper say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that this confrontation is going to come\nDown to this is there's this extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have though\nAnd Americans think to bleed don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nOr the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blamed the Democrats were not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back with a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead [noise]\nWomen are wonderful aren't they some wonderful and that they

new way above a caravan hers is comprised quote of mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries\nVideo footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap and the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nAnd this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan or as make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats ... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally we have one case this was a out

were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from coast to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country and yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march\nNow a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing having been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego helicopter horseback boats all\nTerrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in
