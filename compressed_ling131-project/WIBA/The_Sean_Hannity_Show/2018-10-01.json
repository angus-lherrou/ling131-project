drank a lot and so I don't know where there'd be big discrepancy okay yes go ahead please can you probably you know what you really ... you've had enough already that was the ...\nThen on fire at a press conference earlier today glad you're with us eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program as we are back in our nation's capital this is going to one way or another be a historic week\nAnd we have a lot going on I'll tell you as the program unfold so what was supposed to be\nLast week something that would be limited in scope they were just going to investigate professor Ford's allegations and they were going to do it expeditiously well now they never had any such intention any way shape manner for now it's\nWe've got a democratic US Senate has sent out a press release in it they say\nDemocratic senators FBI must\nInvestigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this is by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person was first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh\nWhen he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations he looked at as Byron York said the gold polls have moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't\n\nA vote on judge Kavanaugh and they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right a professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon\nSeeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart\nAn all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats needs to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brecht cabin on his ... page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording is in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and\nWe know that in the case of professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the\nYou know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection and the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat I witnessed his said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody\nTook ... please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week now is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein owes\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to uh blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol\nI watched it up close and personal you know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose it\nFor some people I there are people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and I have to throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night\nI mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you'd see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good\nIf you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody\nFor that matter um anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd these I stay up the eyes back in the middle of it when we were handed the Hillary Clinton email investigation the director said to me you know you're totally screwed right well maybe you shouldn't have written the exoneration before the investigation maybe you know if he understood what the Espionage Act said maybe if he\nIf he understood what obstruction of justice was he wouldn't have taken lightly thirty three thousand deleted emails and bleach bed and breaking up devices with hammers and so on and so forth\nAnd he goes oh those were the good old days then he goes on a trash the president on every front believing every left wing narrative\nAbout what the ... about what ... what is that about Trump and he goes on to the FBI agents or experts at interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world the follow up with additional interviews\nWas limited in some way by the Trump Administration although the Democrats that said they wanted limited scope they wanted a one week timetable delight that was it it will come from people with testimony and other accounts testing them pushing them in a professional way agents have a\nMuch better nonsense detector the part is is because they aren't starting with a conclusion\nYou mean like he did and then he actually said that you know and then there are people that won't talk and he said\nWell that speaks volumes refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nWhy would anybody after Michael Flynn\nAfter what's that kid's name or Papadopoulos why would anybody talk to the FBI without a lawyer\nConsidering if you make one little mistake or don't make a mistake in the case of General Flynn they'll still charge you with lying to the FBI [noise]\nMy name is Dale ... and I live

yeah a lot happening this week uh Democrats now raising the bar what they said would be limited in scope\nOh no no now they're demanding a full fledged FBI investigation and everything and they're even telling the FBI had to do their jobs and James Comey is suggesting well if you don't talk to the FBI\nIs pretty amazing to me you know just to use his exact words from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem with that is if you don't remember something perfectly\nWith the FBI and you're talking to them it's a crime it's a felony and if you don't believe me asked General Flynn and if you don't believe me as Papadopoulos who faced five years in jail\nYou know the idea that you know the FBI packet in the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what you know when I was handed the Clinton email investigation the deputy director said to me you know\nTotally screwed right well maybe you shouldn't have been writing in may before you interviewed Clinton and before he interviewed any of the other Seventeen witnesses maybe maybe you shouldn't have been writing the exoneration before the investigation\nWasn't screwed if he did it right\nIs it there is no greater bigger case slam dunk case for obstruction of justice than Hillary Clinton the leading subpoenaed emails and bleach but nobody knew what bleach ... was\nPrior to Hillary Clinton using bleach bent on our computers\nNobody it takes a hammer and ... they're all blackberries or iPhone they may take out the sim card you know when you throw it away so somebody doesn't recover personal emails between you and your friends that that would be OK taken a hammer\nDestroying it ... it up I mean that's that's pretty amazing to me if that's not obstruction of justice I don't know what is and then lying about top secret classified special access programming information\nIn a mom and pop shop bathroom closet but the very purpose of avoiding congressional oversight it's the kind of a slam dunk case\nAnd anyway he goes on to but we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work no\nHe attacks the upper echelon of the FBI you missed their call me you personally and he fired you and you obviously resent the hell out of it\nAnd you're angry about it and you're the one that was working with Peter

interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person was first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident told them pull some of them that she could not meet certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... jihad gaps in her memory foggy slurring words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said there's a credible allegation well if it was so credible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of the\nLast week 'cause they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the Kennedys parties are so personally that their wars\nThe cabin on and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape anything girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people I mean that's just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh and they want to continue the smears the slander the lies\nThe mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh\nThen of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford but while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was the ... chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor forward but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is and so anyway they were email sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right of professor forward or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon\nSeeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and won emails sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brecht cabin on his ... page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F a warnings in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition\nAnd that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted to delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case or professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming\nAnd this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody\nTook ... please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week now is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein owes\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he we know we had to have blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol\nI watched it up close and personal you know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose it\nFor some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night\nI mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so he got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he was a pollster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate\nBecause that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six tests the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a Christian do their way\nBack into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night\nAnd you're going to flip the channels they're going to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world\nAnd you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda there's blood thinning of Kavanaugh\n\nTombs crimes in the\nGold ease up GM's coin just paying top prices for gold silver coins
