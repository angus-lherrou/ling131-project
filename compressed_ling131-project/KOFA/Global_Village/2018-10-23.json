village\nNa na\nNa na\nKnow\nYeah my um\n\n\n\n\nThat was pumping knew from the album Jean ... and the KKK and I am most pleased to be able to welcome to the global village ... thank you great to be here this is actually the uh current group that you're working with a group of young musicians young female musicians from Cuba\nIt strikes me in a way that this album in some ways represents a full circle in in your career that you've come around\nFrom being in men T someone who went to Cuba to learn about music to now being a mentor to a new generation of these issues that are coming up but you took a few\n[laughter] I'm sure you go your way to do that I Wonder if you could talk just a little bit as we start about how you actually came to Cuban music because you started with classical used quite some really adventurous jazz and then somehow you wind up with a really different yeah well I guess I have always been curious\nAnd I you know I Love all different styles of music and Nineteen eighty two took the first trip\nTo Cuba that was just originally as a vacation now aren't going there to no\nNo and no idea that there was so much music in Cuba and from the moment got off the plane was music in the airport group lettuce onto the box there was another band in the hotel lobby playing when we got out\nAnd it was a ... of their plane carnival group and then that night was really tonight the clinched it when it was like an Eighteen these big band\nPlaying at the outside bar on the resort and I always lock because it was like more people in the band and there wasn't a hotel there was like and people know that was a brand new hotel tourism which just opening up in Santiago tequila\nBut that did it that night we were up there playing\nSo the the first album that really came following that did you make that that trip well what happened was we kept going back to Cuba\nDid that trip and then three weeks later went to Havana\nAnd that that point I had a handful of names of people that I should look up and one of the names with ... and ... just fall desk and we went to meet them and we became great friends with them now the animal was wonderful jazz drummer\nHe played with Sarah Vaughan and and that King Cole and he broke a lot of racial barriers there because a lot of these performers mean given like a white drummer to to play with and that can go insisted now I'm playing with gamble bread so I Need I Need that found I Need him\nAnd so in those days before the revolution fifties he was laying every single night he said he never slept with so much music\nSo much so much activities with Americans going back and forth and clubs that was just crazy [noise]\nAnd ... his wife was a popular singer so she wasn't Tropicana shows and saying a lot of the popular Cuban repertoire but more importantly as a performer of the afro Cuban folklore music\nShe was highly highly respected she would be on par and would have been the same age as Celia Cruz they were friends they knew each other in a Celia Cruz went to Miami\nAnd ... just let state in in Cuba and she was quite groundbreaking in that she was ... probably first not only woman but first performer that went over live radio at um the insistence of Fernando or tens who was a music colleges there and ...\nThey went over live radio at um the insistence of Fernando where kids who need to colleges they're performed the afro Cuban music on air raid and got a lot of flak from doing that because a lot of\nThe effort human numb practitioners did not want that music going out they didn't know what the audience his response would be you know the backlash from what seems very new do is you know music secretive they wanted to keep it to themselves but she wanted to wanted to bring it to the people\nLet's hear a little bit then from this the first record in the sun\n... right so that means that's in a natural Cuban dialect and look for me and that means for every strong unhappy old Doris strength\nThe um the folklore group you're Ruben dabble attend peaceful clerk group they were all die\nThe government the um the folklore group you're Ruben dabble attend peaceful clerk group they were all dock workers in Havana they were not if you looked at their identity cards it did not say that they were musicians they were not\nTheir identity was as dock workers and so one of the things was it took us almost a good year to be able to get them registered as a musician so that they could go into the studio with us to record\nBecause they weren't allowed in the studio so I just gave you a little bit of that idea of like certain groups of they were organized by the government\nBecause these guys they they performed at the docks they were working and that's how they they formed a group so anyway that's a little tangent there but I did want to let the listeners know about that\nIt seems certainly when you get past a certain point in history that what we broadly called Cuban music is kind of a blend of as so many things are when people meet so you had this meeting of\nAfrican influences and African culture that was coming from slaves who were brought in ... and European colonized was and they to brought their music so there was also\nA European classical traditional yeah that was part of it as well and that also is something that that you explore a bit as well can you talk a little bit about that especially in the ... who did with the Cuban piano master\nAnd yeah there is such a ... with the with the Contra dances and the um dance songs I'm playing a little bit about yeah well that means what those mysterious term yes well they are sort of the pre\nCursor to what came out later as being known as mumble and ... can be like the certain section and a piece where it gets you know they're really funky rhythmic\nSections Contra dance is came first and then that song came came later and out of the country dancers were from the very heavy in European influence\nComing from France and from Spain sort of society dances weren't they that little ball and very very elegant and of course the people were usually lighter skinned and very dressed up and there was a certain distance that they do they have the bodies had to to be and it was a very very elegant and\nAnd then it moved into the dance songs where it opens up a little bit more gets a little bit funky here and they're great composers like ... and ah [noise]\nThat um you know wrote hundreds of like a dance songs so that that whole music has a very\nVery very different feel to it even though it's still the love that song see there's an injection of that very heavy Cuban saying starts to really come through\nIt's beautiful took a little bit about the the piece that we're going to hear ...\nSong from the countryside and this record was done with the two pianos the great Frank Emilio linked to Frank Emilio ... who was that one of the most famous Cuban jets Fiennes part of a group called Los amigos with a great ...\nThis whole record is sin drums we ... we made this record so that people could really focus on hearing the music and the\nThe harmony and really get a sense of that very strong European influence in the music so we did without drums is just base two pianos and myself\nOkay what's your this is ... from Jane but that's in the Cuban piano masters\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\nWere\n\n\nDon't know
