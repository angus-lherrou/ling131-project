to Benny Goodman flying home I'm Gary Walker Loren Schoenberg was good minds archivist and saxophonist for several years\nGoodman and Hampton and the others and the court said I think in later years downplayed the um\nChallenges that they had touring with an integrated group of musicians at that time but you have to do is contemplate the realities of American the Nineteen thirties I mean you know think of those famous science at the N. double ACP used to hang up their office here in New York City saying you know a man was lynched today\nI mean it was a brutal brutal times no matter how much they want a soft soap and say well we never really had problems or\nAre we weren't aware of anything day to day walking down the street getting in the elevator going to the recording studio dealing with booking agents dealing with people who probably made it very clear that they did not like or what\nAn integrated banned it and they had to take it because Benny Goodman was the quote unquote king a swing and if they want it to make some money by having bad\nThat they had to have this integrated ensemble but I'm sure it was a huge challenge you know the first Hollywood film is banned made was the big broadcast of Nineteen thirty seven\nWhich was filmed in Nineteen thirty six and they want it to put the trio when there but they want a government to put his white piano player on the screen and just have to be playing in the background the government said no you can't have the trio so the band appeared in the film but not be integrated trio when we went back to Hollywood the next year\nFor Hollywood Hotel he was already such a big star that he said if you don't take the quartet which now had two black musicians and two white musicians\nThan you can't have the band and we're not going to placing sing sing and this and that so he was able to have that in that scene from Hollywood Hotel what the court tat really should be an all the film history books because it's the first time that you had to black people into white people in uh Hollywood Warner Brothers movie as total equals\nI mean there's not even the slightest ... of the endemic racism of any other thing of inter racial groups at that time somebody somebody's in later this just some condescension\nAnd that seemed out in the fortunate that scene [noise] was segregated [noise] in the movie in a way that it could be clipped out so when they showed the film dance\nFrom Hollywood Hotel with a quartet really shouldn't be an all the film history books because it's the first time that you had to black people into white people in Hollywood Warner Brothers movie as total equals\nI mean there's not even the slightest whiff of the endemic racism of any other thing of inter racial groups at that time or somebody's in butler somebody's in later there's just some condescension\nAnd that seeing that on the fortunate that scene was segregated [noise]\nIn the movie in a way that it could be clipped out too and they showed the film down south they could take that clip out and it wasn't part of the story\nBut nonetheless no I think was a tremendous thing that they did in those days and there was only because of their modesty in their desire to focus on the music to save themselves never spoke about [noise]\nWhat must have meant to all of them and of course the the biggest problem was born by Hampton in Wilson\nBecause they're the ones who couldn't stay in the hotel and they're the ones that probably other stay on the bus and they're the ones that can use the men's room and and all that kind of stuff which makes the which makes the music that they made all the more of a trial\nAnd I think the one we listen to the music we have to be aware of what the reality was at that time than it has to be myself you know the the music becomes even more of an achievement when you consider what it was a achieved and the things [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudience\nFormer famous Carnegie Hall concert of Nineteen thirty eight [noise]\nThat concert recording became the trademark for many good men for decades to come Loren Schoenberg\nIt's hard to put ourselves in the position of feeling what it must have felt like in Nineteen thirty eight to contemplate a jazz concert a car\n\n\nAudience a\nReform famous Carnegie Hall concert of Nineteen thirty eight\nThen cancer recording became the trademark Benny Goodman for decades to come Loren Schoenberg\nIt's hard to put ourselves in the position of feeling what it must have felt like a Nineteen thirty eight to contemplate a jazz concert at Carnegie Hall I mean various jazz artists in the black performers bans have been part of various things that garden evil\nBefore January thirty eight but haven't out and out jazz concert was quite a thing because America was still in the walls of it's tremendous cultural insecurity and in doing that somehow this\nEuropean based music played on the concert hall where people sit like they're in church is somehow you know better or superior to our own\nAfrican American influence jazz music so somehow it was felt that jazz is being elevated or somehow validated by appearing at Carnegie Hall nonetheless it was a tremendous country that was recorded of course the recording came out and buy a dozen years later\nAnd I think it was really the peak of that first part of Benny Goodman is career you know he invited for this big valedictorian cartridges invited the Goodman banding by the people from the base the band\nSo it was good with the height of his fame showcasing people who did what he did as well or better than he did that most people wouldn't do that and they're big Carnegie Hall debut when you think about it today think about it a big popular entertainer who's going to have somebody who who equals were surpassing them they would never do [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brazilian Hour", "city": "Yuma", "day": "14"}
