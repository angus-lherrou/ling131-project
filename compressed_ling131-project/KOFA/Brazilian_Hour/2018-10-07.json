what they would enjoy\nAnd or in a year and a lot of\nMeasures in the music ... you know we didn't really moon and with the new to me more powerful to reach people\nAre nuts but that was ... and um the measure it always Mrs do you think about when she was\nShe was concerned\nYou got to love the music you're such a recording artist\nSo he he wants me to\nYeah that's true in the polls as to what people\nWould like to know what would you would love to hear what they enjoy\nAnd a ... in the year and a lot of\nMysteries in the news or ... you know when we moved to me more power to reach people\nYou know enough to repair boat and um they're measured always Richard ... ... when she was\nYour food to stretch that we\n\n\nSun in the summertime played by flying the family stone\nYou know

stone\nIt just seems like the musicians were always chosen in a way that there was enough raw fish around the edges\nTo make the music dangerous and that's that's what I always liked\nGuitarists singer Warren Haynes is founding member of government you will plays with the Allman brothers\nOne of the biggest lessons I've taken from listening to the music is or how to\nSnatch up the spontaneity when it's their window creative juices are flowing ... kind of go with it and see what happens and don't be scared to leave a lot of the rough edges because that's what makes the music\nSpecial its own way you know you start changing everything that you're not perfect and music and you wind up with music so the one of the lessons\nTo learn from from sly which was also a lesson to be learned from James Brown is\nIf the the musicians making music or great musicians than their first impression is going to be quite amazing it if there is some mistakes and blemishes that go along with that the kids second guess it you got to let that be part of it because a lot of times that's\nWhat makes it even\nYeah well when I say now they're around that day I'll pay by the\nDo and then we'll know may

stone charged in singer Warren hates\nHis sense of corporate graduations so unique I guess in some ways because he played several different instruments or some of the soldier written on piano so the voice things would be different but there's a lot of that what I call later generation gospel\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Want to take you hire

like a volcano rock problem in the front and all kinds of stuff going on anyway there was this music coming out there and\nLater on when I found out that that was lost music\nHe arranged many it's like ... for the nineties and Tio\nYou go on a YouTube when you find those first TV appearances where do you have like three and a half minutes and in that three and a half minutes you'd ever intro\nBut that was referred to one song and then they do maybe four or five songs and ... with key changes on everything and you know it was a lot of harm and going on in the interesting thing is not
