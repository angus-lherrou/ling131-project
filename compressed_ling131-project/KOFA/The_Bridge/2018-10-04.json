points in between wherever you can hear our voices we do hope that you'll take action to support this programming um this is a this was a bit of a leap of faith\nI'm trying something new doing something differently and um we have faced that we're providing a good service you can validate that you can let us know that this is something that is important to you that you like the fact that there is one radio station\nThat welcomes embraces the number of local and Arizona artist that we do maybe you have maybe you're an artist yourself maybe you up to help with some music festival or um or some type of a of a program like that you can help us find is that new music when you call the same number\nHelp with some music festival or um or some type of a of a program like that\nYou can help us find is this new music when you call the same number eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to ... you can choose to make a financial contribution or you can just let us know about that next great Arizona artist that we might not have discovered yet yeah right yeah so\nI kind of Iowa's sorry I hit that ties in with my adult\nTone is so record of you know you were telling us about um about the fact that you're kind of global effect as\nWell uh I have a podcast that it's in Spanish or it's about serial killer it's not for everyone I'm unemployed right now is not for everyone uh we are it's it's explicit right I mean yeah I was very explicit uh\nUm but yeah I mean it's called ... by the guy he thought he that that are on a like a ... based on serial killers\nAnd so we use some black humor just to make a\nA to break the tension because you know it is obviously very gruesome nature the the crimes that were committed by the serial killers you know but uh you know we try to make it fun and um as fun as and murder can be found out what I'm saying is we we try to make it fun to where the listener\nIs intrigued we provide nothing but facts are and if I don't know some of the facts and I asked my uh I guess listeners to correct me if I'm wrong and a sub us yeah we have a lot of participation a I'm On Instagram\nI'm On Twitter a all over the world so yeah\nAnd I think one of the things that resonated with me while this was a dark subject you were very direct I'm One of the first things you said to me was this is not about making fun of the victims I say not this is not about capitalizing on on those crimes\nIs about sharing information that you might not have all of the facts about and but you have where where are your listeners\nAre all over the world and I have some people in China Russia I think no Greenland I'm with a Latin America here in the states I mean you name it uh yeah I'm global\nWell we're glad that you get to come in and play some music to clear your head of all that\nSo yeah it it it's a you know what I listen to a lot of the cast a and I got a point where sometimes I have to turn them off because it's just so much information sure and then on top of their additional research that I have to look for myself so that I could put together my program\nAh it does get a little bit of a Roman and so this you know does clear my head and you know gets me in a good mood and then when they had to go back to work and produced a podcast than you know it's kind of being serious but then you know I have that though you know a couple of jokes in there once in a while just to make it\nFunny what do you like most about this part of your of your job or this part of of your jobs working here at a border radio\n... this is going to sound crazy but the the the fact that I'm getting better at speaking more fluent and so you know ... ... that's the best part of my person\nBecause this helps me or not only in my professional a life here at the station but also out there while I'm when I'm dealing with some of my other customers you got to have like the other businesses that I run as well and everybody and be like oh ours I have an e bay or I mean you name it\nI Am ... you don't have the coffee shop in the trunk no [laughter] that one down [laughter] I Know that's the best thing about it this way you want people to donate golfing right\nNow we're going to have be having expressed hope that they haven't I haven't but yeah that's the best thing that it it's gotten me to be a little bit more ... more open and so that's that's one of the main things I think let's get back to some more music I just\nBut yeah that's the best thing that it it got me to be a little bit more ... more open and so that's that's one of the main things I think\nThat you get back to some more music I this is a wonderful collaboration Willie Nelson I don't know if that guy is ever going to die you probably\nHad enough preservatives preservatives that maybe you'd never will but he keeps popping out I was a couple of years ago he did a beautiful I'm called to all the girls and it was all ... with the Willie Nelson and some of his\nFavorite that women are hardest hit song I really like it's an old tuna written by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer and uh he worked with Sheryl Crow on this it's called\nFar away places Mm\nLittle ...\nStrain nice sounding names\nAre way over\nAs far below would\nTrain sound and they\nAre called\nI'm\n\nIf\nSearch for the castles and the man [noise]\nThey calm demeanor [noise]",
