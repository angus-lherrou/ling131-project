of those are personal to me as I said that's a part of my set that I called 'em stand for something\nAnd it's about ... it's about what these songs bring to you and how they make you think and I think that's something that music does it's one of the reasons that you listen to border radio\nOne of the reasons you might support it is that you are um occasionally you hear a song that is kind of deep and it talks about important issues like these dead maybe that's why you'll pick up the phone and call us at eight seven seven eight three eight\nFive to nine to eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to contribute securely on line at\nA border radio ... dot org\nNow the couple of songs that that we did just hear 'em prince prince was interesting we were going to lead with that one but since we started with Michael frontiers hello bunch or\nI Love that song because if you listen to the lyrics of that song it is all about the importance of diversity and inclusion it's all about how some people will judge others based on their race based on their religion based on their gender identity\nAnd where Michael is pointing out you know what ... how dare you how dare you think that you are superior to another culture\nUm and uh Casper ah Casper ... ah Casper is is a friend and um you can also find some of his music with the band or the mighty sick so to band\nUm in Casper song how the west was won when I hear people scream about immigration and border issues I'm reminded to think about this song where who owned the land first how did we come to be here and at what point did we decide\nDid white people decide that we are going to close the borders were going to shut our clothes the fences because now it's all ours well you know what the Native Americans own at first and so that one mix\nPeople decide that we are going to close the borders were going to shut our clothes the fences because now it's all ours well you know what the Native Americans owned it first and so that one makes me think and I can't hear print at all and think about the fact that Thirty years ago I fell in love with him\nAnd about three years ago he fell in my arms I was at a conference concert in Toronto um just right at the stage\nHe did a trust fall back into the audience and I was one of three or four people that cost him held him back up so each of those are really important to me for different ways maybe they touched you maybe other songs here touched you consider making a contribution by calling eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to we've got our phone\nBanks that
