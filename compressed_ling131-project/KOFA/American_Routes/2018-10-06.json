recurring given become a sustaining member of ... a border radio\nCall us at eight seven seven eight three eight and let us know what you'd like this to be a one time gift or whether you'd like to

[laughter] so [laughter]\nAnd your first vinyl have you ever bought any vital napping I I've been trying to get one but I had to get a vital and where to play [laughter] [laughter]\nI give us a call right now support border radio support the bridge\nI support all the program and you hear on this radio station as we've explained a few times in the past we get a base amount of budget every year from Arizona western college which keeps the lights on a phase most of the salaries of the full time employees\nWe also get a grant from the corporation for public broadcasting and uh that's about ten or twelve percent of our budget but the ... all of our budget especially for pain for programming\nIs from listeners just like you and uh it's really important we got some seed money from the college from an innovation fund grant to start this border radio project and to create the border radio internship program but that seed money has kind of a crowded and been harvested already\nSo are we really need a new infusion of support\nAnd now we're turning to listeners like you to help make it possible that we continue this wonderful experiment call us at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to to show your support for border radio and community radio\nAnd this uh eclectic mix of music that you hear on this radio dial everyday\nAgain that number's eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to ... you can pledge securely online at\nBorder radio ac dot org\nIt's so easy to give and there's a lot of reasons you may choose to it could be the fact that we are providing an opportunity for voices you've never heard before for songs that you've never heard before that we're encouraging people to learn our interns to learn more about radio more about\nMusic and frankly more about communication and um we are crossing borders here much as the show implies you can cross that border that barrier maybe of making that first call it's so easy you know your phone's in your hand\nYou're looking at it right now okay move off a snapshot move off of and so All right and uh and and flip over to the radio affects up and join up there or the tune in and out or you could even listen to it on line at or radio ABC dot org but I'm also take a moment\nTo give us a call eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to is the number to do something\nNow runs a how to how has\nOr how does border radio internship fit into your academic or plans or is it even part of as a reflect your academic goals\nI said I'm a theater major so at least for me being a native Spanish speaker I tend to speak really really fast sometimes to the point where no one understands me or even I don't understand my\nDining here as an intern for for ... radio\nDumb also take a moment to uh give us a call ... seven seven eight three eight five to nine two numbers do so now runs a how to how has so how does border radio internship fit into your academic or plans or is it even harder because it reflect your academic goals\nAnd added to it I'm a theater major so at least for me being a native Spanish speaker I tend to speak really really fast sometimes to the point where no one understands me or even I don't understand myself\nSo being here as an intern for for ... radio has taught me to slow down and listen to what I'm saying and my diction has come into very nicely but let me tell you look at it a lot at least on my side that's\nGreat well we're glad to be able to offer that opportunity to students here in Arizona western college and uh and it's been two for me it's been a real blast up working with the students and uh and uh it's kind of reinvigorated my my love for what we do hear a border radio who's our next door to going to be\nOr not is one is going to be Bruno Mars with fast but not with ... just the original story\nBut are there you go here's all Bruno Mars beer Saturday morning\n[noise] [noise]\nNo\n[noise]\nKnow that I had a chance to man\nEnough\nHistory is when we\n\nI imagine man\nThat path man\n\nIt's you know\n[noise]\n\n\nA noncommercial educational radio station and we take that to that a\nDesignation to heart because we try to be a little informative about the music and not just to have a computer generated platelets college right now so it's valuable to you when you call eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that's eight seven seven eight three eight five to Niger we've got our fair share from our development team with an update from pledge central\nYes I'm One of the updates I'd like to give them is that we'd like to hear from you right now about the good right now Vicky super has been getting an education and all the newest artists on the scene of a lot of people that are maybe she'd never heard of and that that's one of the things that I appreciate about border radio is that\nSometimes I Do hear about artists new and old\nThat I have never heard of before so if you appreciate that you've learned something new this morning on board or radio give us a call at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to because our funding model is a little of interesting so essentially we have some funding from Arizona western college they keep the lights on and keeps everything running\nAnd then we have additional funding a small amount from the corporation for public broadcasting\nBut then the difference that you make right now that listeners support is\nHelping to fund our student internship program which is relatively new program for us although it it goes back to our roots\nWhen this station was founded in Nineteen Seventy it started as a student training facility and\nWe kind of have gone back and forth from that model over the last almost fifty years and we're really proud that we were able to come back to that model does here\nThanks to funding from our listeners and as sea grant from Arizona what's in college and innovation fund so if you want to make sure that this project continues that we continue to have a place for students to come and and learn and as the routes and said earlier this hour about you know\nI'm being part of your academic mix with your theater background and being able to help students get that like up to have that next point and um their career their path or journey
