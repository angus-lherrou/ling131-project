and\n... this is an amazing form of music not necessarily lending itself to Vogel so how do you how do you how do you get to interpret this as a as an artist cars that you are brilliant or about to find out how brilliant you are but but lending the human voice to music like that's not an easy thing to\nDo well and during that she had to think of myself as a part of the band you know and it's not just talk to the band and you know so there isn't guitar and this is really who I Am on the band member so that's how I think that you know well whereabouts or find out a Paul or a\nThat you are you did that when you were in Paris\nRight you went up to what you did your soda and you did the uh busking thing you'd be played on on the streets now that's something that a Django did as well he had in his early years is so so I mean what was that like for you as an artist performing\nBut and you know so there isn't guitar and this is really who I Am on the band member so that's how I think that you know well we're about to find out Nepal or a\nWhen you [laughter]\nThat you are you did it when you were in Paris\nRight he went on and we did your soda and you did the busking thing you'll be played on on the streets that's something that Django did as well he had in his early years or so\nSo I mean what was that like for you as an artist performing in the streets of Paris kind of a romantic sending me yeah I I Am kind of a hopeless romantic but what was really funny about it I had a ...\nAnd I'm a lot of people took my picture and then they would come up to me and say excuse anymore\n... blue photograph bay she's it okay and I would do my best French impersonation ago [noise] [noise]\nI made so much money can people think that I was French planes yeah\nSo it was the beginning of you know you're you're saying the cheetahs speaking French is to sound annoyed that how that works if you saw the movie sweetened loaded on there was a character an actor that\nPlay Django Reinhardt and that was the one I don't want I don't want French folks listening to us on American forces ready to be upset the beautiful language survivor Leo\nAnd and and is value a growing up in France where are you familiar with the music of Django when as a young\nGirl not so much actually I came to Django after learning about jazz which is kinda weird that um [noise]\nYou know I was growing up in France and listening to French radio and there wasn't much Django Reinhardt undifferentiated even at the time and he really\nHad his second term to feign a and the year two thousand where I'm a French hop artist sort of an hurts and an hurts yet what you see what any and uh and brought it back to the public actually well\nIn recent the ... the last Twenty years a lot of his music has been used in motion pictures which is another way of of introducing his his music to the\nTo the public but I don't think his back story is really well known Paul I mean the whole idea of the other being so severely handicapped and us being in being almost superhuman on a trip board right I mean that\nThat that is as as brilliant a part of his his aura as the music itself yeah superhuman that's it that's all you need to know that's that's all we're going to talk about\nThat's fine so we're going to get back to Isabella here you have a wonderful CD coal live at your she's where a lot of this music is found and you're going to do to an appropriately enough that you can sing called I Love Paris yeah hot club of San Francisco on the phone\n\nHave you had in\nMind and you know I haven't been there
