Burgess back there are [noise]\nThe artist for grandma voice Smith gratified to have you here for our we overlaid to ...\nWhat an amazing projects that are that in a ... this this era of America's history someone would turn their attention back to this incredibly dramatic time in American history so where where did your interest in the depression era and the dust bowl I'm situation in America\nWho was actually kind of an accident I was running its own one day and you know I'm sure you're a songwriter much of a song writers and you just throw out ideas and I just had this idea for a song that\nEventually turned it into something that sounded like it was about a drought and I thought well that's I got changed that because no one wants to hear some of the drought but\nNo matter what I tried I could not change that I had to have those words and so I thought well there was a big drought one time what was that I went on the Internet and I sat there for seven hours\nFor burst in the first five minutes refreshing whatever I learned in school which wasn't much and then I expanded my knowledge I over the next two three years it took me to write the album and like I could write a book about the death toll now but it it really opened my eyes when I read and listen to interviews of survivors that they take their record on film in the Nineteen seventies I was just amazed\nWell it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in American history especially what happened to its own\nIts own people I mean you know Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name uh supporting the poor people of the dust bowl era but he was from there he was from Oklahoma eat at home and you were born in Jacksonville and you ...\nThree years it took me to write the album and I think I could write a book about the duck poll now but it it really opened my eyes when I read and listen to interviews of survivors that they take their record on film in the Nineteen seventies I was just amazed\n[noise] well it it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in American history especially what happened to its own its own people I mean you know Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name was supporting the poor people of the dust bowl era but he was from there he was from Oklahoma City bombing\nYou were born in Jacksonville and you kind of moved up north to Rhode Island and and you've been like all over the place having you having you interpret this is really kind of a neat thing because you're really opening your\nAnd you took your time on this album he spent almost three years putting it together I made it twice\nI recorded at once and threw it all away and start all over again so what why why wouldn't you throw it away it wasn't good enough well that would be a good reason and\nI didn't have that song I just played just now I didn't have that one yet or the other one another one that will still I'm caught in my ... my prime pronouncing that right you can't pronounce it right because the the Choctaw people by the way they taught me how to say how do you say how do you say ... but they use L H A T H like\nThey use our alphabet because they never did have a written so let's let's give them ... to properly again astronomical\nMeans have strengthened the Choctaw language and I actually I knew a friend of mine said you've got to write a song about the Native Americans during the dust bowl\nThis was after I threw in the first version of the record and I said oh man you're exactly right but I don't know how to write such a song because I'm not a Native American idol\nI think if I Want to just wouldn't be true enough so I contacted after I realized the Choctaw were the first of the five tribes marched and the trail of tears a hundred years before the dust bowl I contacted the Choctaw tribe and they helped me so much right the song I have to give them a giant thank you and\nThey deserve a lot of credit well it's nice that you are\nSo you are you do this and you put the put the album out I mean\nWas it trying to get audiences especially young kids today are not there may not be really aware of the dust bowl or what was happening in America at that time so this is like a whole education thing\nGoing is actually created a one man show or have a twelve foot video screen behind me I've got hundreds of the pictures that were taken back then and I did it for the high school in Bakersfield, California about seven months ago and I couldn't believe I had some some kids now they're just kids understand they haven't learned about it yet but they live in ...\nTheir whole lives and they came up to me a couple of them and said how come you're how come you mentioned Bakersfield a few times in these songs we don't get it so there there's a lot that needs to be I think informed hearing\nWelcome Bakersfield was the site of a lot of the grows that supposedly advertised for workers and and your hands up thousands of people from Oklahoma and Kansas went to areas like Baker's she'll end there were no jobs\nThere was like ... one job for every thousand people that can you get one\nYeah I mean it's uh it it it truly and really
