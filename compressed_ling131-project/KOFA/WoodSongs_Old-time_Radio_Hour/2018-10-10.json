her a shot showing camp is on the lam and a really cool to a a sort of is the selection of artists all kinds of related to Memphis the current in contemporary a kind of tackling that material I and I\nI thought it was a cool selection of material there's some really well known stuff but there's also some some pretty obscure stuff on there too which I thought was cool to sort of represent\nAnd giving props were props or do we know who Luther is a camera as a a is a true a patriot of of a mini artist she supported guy Clark\nOr working heavily with Chris christopherson right now and she's really supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tribute to sun records of certainly appropriate for her\n[noise] and I and I\nIt and so you're you're taught to tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound in ... as an artist your interest in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records or is this something you were interested in is a little kid or does come out yeah\nI mean I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was you know a teenager that I and I was playing music already that are sort of study did and dug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that\nTom tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound in ... as an artist your interest in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records or is this something you were interested in this little kid or does\nCome out yeah I mean I I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager and I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of it as a child\nI became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I'm not\nCompletely completely changed my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever moved in Memphis and then I moved here about twelve Thirteen Years ago and uh\nI'm just really got to be a full time student Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and an around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis things kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering you know I'm you know but ah yeah it's a and the ... the Memphis Sound is so broad you know you talk about another sound but there's more than one son records is one thing that ... stacks records Iraqis are to\nYou know there's the the there there's not a Memphis down there are meant the sounds you\nKnow well and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son record Amy you worked at son record as as a tour guide let's talk about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy orbits and Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nNotice this stage might need bigger than the actual tracking round one car garage really radiator shot it was the radiation [laughter] small\nIt has these uh white acoustic tiles I'm a raw and for whatever its best is that this child on the front and the ceiling or Israel odd it had to fill that hole peaks and valleys all along with half of the room like\nHelp to sound in there and then one big glass window and family ... looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk the line which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists\nAnd why they actually and I actually knew senator set\nBuilders and they built it\nPretty they'd built a whole nother studio down main street meant they were the storefront to look just like it inside their advocates say the owner is signed with respect for the people that come from all over the world\nTo the sun city out that he didn't want to credit to the public\nFilming said they had to build the\nThey had to build their own\nWe had to record the sun sessions at night after seven after they've finished the tours through so we did the daytime so she's been operating studio\nAnd I have only at night do they do they have the do they have the same\nRecording board that they had the old arc deal to this whole new stuff yeah yeah all staff knew all\nHave the actual\nThe actual game they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that seem to go around and make field according to British added that to me again and it's really cool things in the studio knew all\nThe actual console that same ad is at the rock console museum\n... operating studio at night but only at night do they do they have to do they have the same recording board that they had the old dark the old so this whole new stuff yeah ... yeah staff knew all they don't have the actual\nThe actual yeah they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that can you to go around and make field according to bring it back in the mean ... that's really cool things in the studio\nKnew all the actual console that same ad is at the rock and roll museum\nThat they actual it still exists is just just not they're not operators amazing I give props were props is due again I mean it's amazing how good those records sound even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it's a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album that does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam Philips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul ... this is a tune called the red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the woods songs old time\n\nAh then no one alone
