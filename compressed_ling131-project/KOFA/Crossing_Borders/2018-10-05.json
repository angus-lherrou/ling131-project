Russian who is still here locally acquired\nA and his son and I were friends we were watching one of the YouTube shows and visiting her a Melissa Russian most are the director of the children's museum author and say oh we tuned into the college radio station I heard the posts on I've seen it in Rolling Stone and like yeah picked up the vital pretty straight away after that some\nGood stuff and that was the fiesta song which is a a perfect example of what this radio stations all about because we are border radio and we are crossing borders we believe that we love music from both sides of the border in fact all sides of every border and that the station is all about and\nThat was clearly had an Irish man's perspective on more as I said I I\nI'm really trying to not order another round I

the world on it or that tune in one word and then the other one is called radio FX that's all one word\nAnd now I really liked that one because it's all college radio stations stations like ours that are trying to get a you know have that college radio sound with students involved\nAnd what I liked about radio effects and that happens it it has shortcuts to all of our social media would really convenient so if you want to listen to us on the smartphone a check out one of those apps downloaded and you can hear us even when you are and you can't get us on the radio waves and all starts with getting involved in local public radio station that is what\nPublic radio is all about is a community involvement so please get involved now eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine\nTo ... even if they if they do choose to use radio FX or maybe they just decided to look for our social media it's easy to find as we're border radio easy on Instagram and on Twitter and as well as on Facebook\nSo you can find us in any of those locations and while we've been very busy here we're steadily posting some photos so we will get some things out right away as soon as possible you'll see a nice stream on any of those sites but I Know Chris you and you and Fox you've been you've been a little ahead of us you've been promoting some stuff on your social media\nYeah so ah you know we put it

friends all the employer and go on everybody about it for a week or so now\n... anybody you need to you know publicly out that they should be picking up the phone if his wife\nCarrie [laughter] they're not sending Goodman she'll be calling right now uh he should be donated the great enabler things like that [laughter]\nYou know all we're asking for is you know donate the cost of one beer per month for like the whole year you know good yeah I mean that's a simple six bucks a month ... done\nVery easy very easy for you to take care of now we know I'm a day pointed out that you're batting a thousand here with the level of support that um that you fed us today that you individually support the station and that you're supporting it through your business now it might make sense that yes you're passionate about the station but why is it a good idea for your business to be a part of this\nSo it's it's absolutely the demographic that comes in a very I mean you've got progressive thinking you've got people that are interested in the community and getting locally involve moving it things that are source locally [noise] this is I mean you know public radio and you guys here doing it as local as you can get any kind of doing the same thing we're doing over there are ways\nThat we we all have different service offerings [laughter]\n[laughter]\nNo doubt and that's where you guys are like a a say frequently when we're talking about are a music service here it this says this music services definitely touched by human hands or we don't use a computer algorithm we don't have a a giant a computer in the sky sending us down all the music that we are going to play a we pick it out\nUh we uh we curated a I don't know if you guys walk by all the albums out in the lobby we have a huge collection a professor here on campus donated just to us the other day\n[laughter]\nNo doubt and that's where you guys are like a a say frequently when we're talking about are a music service here it says this music services definitely touched by human hands or we don't use a computer algorithm we don't have a\nA giant a computer in the sky sending us down all the music that we are going to play a we pick it out uh we uh we curated\nA I don't know if you guys walk by all the albums out in the lobby we have a huge collection a professor here on campus donated just to us the other day\nSome great music from the late seventies and eighties all every single step an album in pristine condition yeah on on the original while\nJust gorgeous seven right now we're we're sorting through that and getting that all into our our platelets so we definitely a hands on a humans are involved and that and then what we like to do and what I specially I'm teaching to the student DJ's on the\nCrossing borders program is um is don't just play a bunch of music tell people why you played where I'm from hell it how it affected you tell a hell of a you know what it reminded you are\nAnd that that's what I think makes the programming so much fun and that's what I've been trying to do on the bridge for many years and end with this new format it's kind of like uh we kinda broken down the barriers and said hey we're gonna go we're going to go all the way to the wall on adding and er and make this thing really happen because\nUh we know that there's an audience out there that cares about the news cares about what's going on so we do newscast and things you're about to ... see news guys\nBut also just wants to get away from it sometimes and just think about other stuff something called us right now at eight seven seven eight three eight\nFive to nine to that's eight seven seven eight three eight\nFive to nine to icy without one line busy we still have several lines open please call and uh and give us a give us whatever you can to help support this and I know that's what the whole idea behind the craft beer a beer movement is its hands on human made stuff yet right knives and local support that's how we live\nHand to hand you know people right next to you're making the same guy drink and with you know we do outside of that as they know who to blame [laughter] sometimes it's a win [laughter] not one of the perks my job I get to direct that [laughter]\n[laughter]\nHey I've got I've got an idea out there and we we talked about the ways that you can use the day sponsorship if you pick up the phone and call here locally nine to eight three four four seven six nine three that's three four four seven six nine three or anywhere you can hear our voices it's eight seven seven eight three eight\nFive to nine to [noise] um we mentioned the day sponsorship program but we didn't mention how easy it is to use it and that it's completely transferable\nSo if you'd like to double dip get the most for your money you call eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to make a fifty dollar contribution and you tell us what nonprofit organization you'd like to support with it\nIf you know the contacts there tell us will or if you don't look it up ourself\nWe'll call them we'll let them know that you gave them this gift and I'll guarantee you that it's something that they would great fully accept because every nonprofit has some form of a of a special event and though the number one thing nonprofits wants you to give them and we are nonprofits is money\nThe number two things to help them make money and you can do that by getting a day sponsorship fifty dollars when you call eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to\n... right now at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to a this is one of my favorite parts oh I'm Sorry go ahead I'll actually sweetened the deal if somebody calls in for days sponsorship first got calls in for a day sponsorship match it so I had no\nIdea either you know there's no doubt it's like trickling down I guess you're helping us if you start with Chris was going to help out and um and match that so he'll help you you pick your nonprofit you pick your days on a ship and he'll make it too for that non profit\nNine to call right now at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that's eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to a this is one of my favorite parts oh I'm Sorry go ahead I'll actually swinging to deal with somebody calls introduced sponsorship first got called and predict sponsorship matches so neither\nDid I. G. okay there you go ahead yeah there you know there's no doubt it's like trickling down I sort of helping us if you start with Chris was going to help out in them and matched up so she'll help you you pick your nonprofit you pick your date sponsorship and he'll make it to for the nonprofit\nOver to call right now and eight seven seven eight three eighty five to nine to that's eight seven seven eight three eight fifty two Ninety two now my one of my favorite parts about though with my job is getting to discover a band or especially a lot of new music I got I get emails every day from all these record companies and stuff and some of it's worth worth the effort\nBut what I really love a discovery bands had been around for a while but I never knew about\nI'd never heard of anything called mustard plus I might be by doing I don't know how did you come across these guys\nAre just you know her late nineties early to thousands that was a music comes into and still to this day still working through it heard the song ten thousand times and I'll listen to it again right now\nOkay All right well here's a song or a appropriately called beer\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou know\n\nMan\nCheck it out\n\n\nI decided I'd give them a meager twenty five dollar gift and it became my station\nThat's right and so whatever you can give to us we'll be your your station forever and you'll be of course be able to enjoy it and you'll also have that feeling of hey I helped to make that happen I helped make that possible and that is why local public radio is all about give us a call at eight seven seven eight three eight\nFive to Niger that's eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to show your support for public radio in this new experiment we have with border radio like kale ...\nAnything else you guys want to talk about uh you know don't it don't it don't it right\nFor these guys are doing some cool for the for the area or whatever you can like they said don't call the lines give them a little something source for the call mark they're calling nine to a three or four four seven six nine three locally or eight seven seven eight three eight five tonight\nTo there you go it's easy to do all but you have to make the decision that you're going to support something that you care about and that's the first step to becoming more involved\nDon't drive us going to say so all of my friends in Flagstaff that are listening and in Prescott that are listening I Know there's at least two of you and got ... so a time to call in boys [laughter] that works in Wisconsin through job\n[laughter] show right they're big red button on the ah listen now page paid seven seven eight thirty eight five two nights you that's eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to twelve feet from anywhere or a locally here in Yuma three four four seven six nine three you can also pledging too early on line at K.
