know any more\nUh All right so in for George Norris tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween ... is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer about the scariest story you could ever imagine to here\nIt's still loose of serial killer about the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true and also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James who so it'd be better no as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not\nIn he's not in LA tonight ... originally we had um scheduled\nA Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out\nHe wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like you know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff um it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up and then something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying leery of empire but I was looking at him behind home plate and I'm just saying this um he may not be a vampire\nBut long after I'm dead Larry King will be onto a wife number not with another round of kids and still be home plate\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's\nReally about what's going on right here in right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got a finger in this whole neural net\nA business that says the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a pitcher minutes now so you injected into\nThe brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neuron that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosque it's foreseen\nIs the day when we ... with the use the one of these narrow in that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so\nI think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally of it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce he had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can talk about that tonight we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when they see the future because what we can do now is the frontier\nBut that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movie\nThat's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter] I can go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh I\nKnow absolutely and and you're right that this book deals with\nWe're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the presence and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about high in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNow these are things that are now becoming realize and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is the mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... that we are creating these are incredible robots and artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now\nAt will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's ... right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and end of the the I think\nThis is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the officer really important in there to show you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give him credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history\nAnd I do I love science history because of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this but\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect based in their\n... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand but now that you can imagine\nOh no it's I mean I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me\n[noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant are a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming the scientists since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it and so I became a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my my faith very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets of faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think um\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic studies so much so that the pope route and ... and ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list next on coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nThat space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like whether that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me question\nWhether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for the what is the ultimate let's see ... used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\nYeah I agree with you in and uh I think in another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to like say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example\nThere is such a good way in California right\nAs a company in California that is um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most science policy so a lot of the technology that that is aimed at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality\nIs going to be available to the super rich and so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and\nSo I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no use in that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nYeah well I figured it the late night show so\nI Try and she's going to lay you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know tied that the white you that was up but uh\n[laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling book out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers in a Google executive uh and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to\nAvoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging on ... ... ... lives in this position because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophies\nRight is it ... to ... and yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm worth thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park\nWhen he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they ... they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral it leads any we could\nYou know a ... quantify society it's the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff\nYou know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the clash that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance this it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from H. G. wells time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no ... it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when traffic part came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I show I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he does\nNot just a job and you know he has though [laughter] I was at ... pointed and his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nCollege right now you know [laughter] but now you got for him but yeah\nNow you know [laughter] but no\nJob for him but yeah it's it's ... I I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed during work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know or you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what were you learn is that\nUh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's the media or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know how long\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half with a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact\nJust the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it well and now here's\nAn age now let me bring up a little differently if there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nNow know the fact that they you know some giant bird in New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know there's going so I mean I I realize you could make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that Darren brought him back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we started looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's when I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... becomes dumb writes scary because who is going to be making these decisions\nOnce that technology becomes more facile [noise]\nYeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about of these the extinction efforts that are going on right now I'm that ... primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nAnd I I remember when I was at ABC News I was actually invited to come to Russia where there there there were a group of scientists I think the French guy was in charge of the group as I

[noise]\nWell you know with a book like the end of life as we know it [noise] I think the bumper was pretty predictable it's like a law uh but still a great dog after all these years Michael Gilliland\nIs the author of this book the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science we'll we'll get back to some of the other things that he's concerned about the book is not all doom and gloom industry pretty exciting fun interesting things that are coming from the frontiers of science and in a couple of things we want to keep\nAn eye on I'm saying about you [noise] uh and uh and it\nWill be the end of life as we know what life will carry on but what will it be like we'll talk more about that just admitted also will bring you into the conversation at the bottom of the hour we'll get the numbers at the bottom of the hour the next hour we go to open lines cause it's friday Georgia's got the night off I'm sitting in\nAnd uh and I want to get back to some of those go stories that are up the coast to coast am dot com so I'm giving you the heads up\nTo look for a story about the ghost that moves the jar you can see the video it's it's in the carousel as we call it the you know the rotating stories at the top of the fold the website of coast to coast to him to come watch that before we get\nTo open lines next door I'd love to hear your explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about a about ... to about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about ... it's more than that we'll get to next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it\nWe've got a great gift\nWe've got a great feeling story of or in the house one of\nThose botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue\nOr white or light the light bulb went on and I started to research and found out and save Iran's life yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing me back and it's kind of almost eight years now\nHow did you did you take the liquid did you take the cat\nI was going through capsules like or I couldn't you know enough it made me feel so much better\nSoon after you begin taking the council's you kind of felt this was going to be a good thing\n... St Martin I can only tell you one thing the product war and not only works in one way it works as a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy and it gives me vitality carrying my how\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that a a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that\nAnd um everybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which was a mechanical heart in a human being and you know was in South Africa right and yeah a junkie and\nAnd and and and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a we're even getting past mechanical heart hey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one\nThere are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but there you are\nNo you know the minute University of Minnesota's monster instantly do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour or one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway\nYou have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ...\n... they're sheep human and pick human come era so these are creatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers\nHuman hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat and you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because\nHis kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discussed is the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's\nRight if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability\nTo tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me gives me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's\nInteresting is that these guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility says it's not like you know made up pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is the possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just pushed the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the\nGuidelines what are the guard rails I'm sure that\nI'm sure these guys are not just to get a violation of the unit you're probably doing it against the advice of their moms [laughter] what do you do yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then montebello which has a town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen\nAnd I look back and I'm Out there and the garage that the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nBelow I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see\nHappens that's the only reason I was a little mad scientist there yet [laughter]\nWhat happens is that the only reason I was a little mad scientist yeah there you\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nThat they can marry you're right the mothers I say why don't you know right in that already go someplace tiddlywinks if something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I didn't know what I didn't mean standing\nFifteens inning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of works and so I don't know I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... that's ... that's how it's happening right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it\nSo sorry Joe ... is the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on windows Siri is it snowing you know or you know Google ... by me soon you know\nBy me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of business and I kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the down side of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to\nWorry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about our fell okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a\nBunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know this a\nDollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and\nParents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson in like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have a mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders [laughter] yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming authority ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch\nAnd record his torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passions listening that is going on now we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nI think that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now are more than a billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry the end of life as we know it Michael Guillen next on coast to coast am into George ... on it\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit\nWith one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story\nFrom the husband and then and then the other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband\nHe ended up being charged with murder\nBecause of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for\nHow long I mean there that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited it on ourselves in we're well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked him a lot of them I mean I I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh did you know they always do you know ripped from Janine did lead to you know but that's where I mean I I think that they like to\nCatch a killer is one thing when people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the ... been the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convictions somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face print\nRight or that they don't you cover in\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy room with which raises the possibility that you and I\nCan have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database\nBut the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know that let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly\nGood ah oh eight at night on my own\nTurned back up to go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I argue or speaking about the uh Jarvis cart have a couple\nOf friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even as a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but a great to have him on to tell a story about a lot of things I'm One of the um the\nPredecessors of that artificial heart was a a heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he\nAnd his career as a heart surgery at um paranormal experiences wanted which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do\nThat basically it's as if us kinetic or whatever it was clear right in his mind and he did the surgery or from those instructions said he was able to see him his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a recovering Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew there were ... we had our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of blown so let me go\nTo a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\n... Michael I got one question for you here where does it end where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we it's a good question are we plane died yet and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture\nA child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink\nOr that can really within right there but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we wouldn't\nA ... premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid the phrase although I Know it's a popular place for it right and\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing\n... for what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire yeah oh totally\nI what I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil field a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I have to get there with through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the minefield\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see as their icy as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mind that it's gonna do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's getting sunshine but I as I say all it takes\nFor us to do with the step on that one mind that one hit and mine and it's just gonna blow us up\nNo camera master the thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I met in\n... so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics\nLet me just give you would I think is a better metaphor though for for a science and this is is we had to get you had you know let's say the the goal was the other side of that minefield\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and enough scientist run through the mine field the goal will be achieved\nYou know that there will be some casualties along the way as their inevitably are the the the premise that I'm most worried about is whether we get blown up in the mine field because science blows up all the time right but is whether the goal is worth achieving in the first place and that's the part where\nYou can look out the window or click on line either way you get the weather though are way as good for thirty six hours WTO\nAlso cool the rhetorical heat subject Callahan Fox News on the day

this complication was going to get worse\nI I think it is you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breath over then we just just just cut us off guard so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I yeah I I think I think you have any leaves highway\nAt ... and that this is they are quick might want their right to know cool toy and I grew up and I you know\nI grew up around radio

me\nI\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kind of shit what station did your father worked for a week\nHe came in and pet ... and they were where oh oh wow\nI Know panicky some simply shit I Would like to I was like to hear you good luck to you have a great night I I've always work I'm not that technically advance I mean I can handle the\nLittle one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love the engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they could just builds up to not enough and I'm All right so that brings me to oh Keith from Virginia is back so she had called the um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called Becky so you you had a friend who it was you were telling a story about how the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um\nThat individual by the way and and ah thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very topics you discussed and and they are related to some of the things I wanted to say too but I'm sure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and\nUh also had a a he relates experience of a failure or twice in surgery in which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later\nMany years later a visited him from the spirit world\nAnd delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same time I'm now from that in a ... at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having is\nWorld renowned medical career became the credit of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd I'm anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and other things in which\nThings revealed by the ... just gave a little bit more in height and tied on things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link\nAbout paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had a profit\nAnd he brought about a lot of new scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise] you know and and\nWe're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I\nBasically to wrap it up to be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about and he taught about\nAnd I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman naps and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles into\nThem lost by you know the the church from the council on income and some of the scriptures that off but we're the base of the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out um\nBut that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends ... so\nThat'll be conversation over an iced tea\nSplurge little Jesse\nAlright Joe are coming up next our that I'm not sure I'm next to have a more open line Paul's we'll give you all the numbers you need to take us wherever you want to take is coming up next on coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nYet but the looting of that but moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors independence or the ... in this little cup holder who district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar was on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh\nBut I don't get the thing with the the pencils in the in the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled your guy so I'll go with that until it got\nPencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled their guy so I'll go with that until it got any other theory to a a back in a ... show is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nOh wow Hi I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver I'm not like they're all\nFirst things first the\nFirst things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute would that be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second okay Ron I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you what I was\nWondering why it's like I was raised as a card for it and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and for other options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that that's the way I have inside and well not from hair gas Michael I'm crossing and when you first got on\nHe was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and\nThe way that lady\nCome on and read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong religious staff exactly but I'm a little bit like\nI ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how it can trap the authenticity of the Bible because you know I have often heard that a lot of the major stories from it like the area that fried and the story of a you know like\nI said here are a hero type state giving line of American and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call ... ... ... talk for like ... and ... and you know whatever creates the Bible\nSour you're talking about the ... you're talking about\n... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the end the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God or ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay\nThere's a there's a difference to me\nAnd there are truly does that we know to be a worse steering by right there there you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest the\nBible it they'll let you know story that can be found in other places we can still try to find like the other information on the ban\nWill know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it do you can you do live your life better does it improve your life that's\nThe question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow come\nTo think of that let's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nThere's a long time out here to thing without good\nGood will be a big hope your bed ma'am a gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey and it's nice to be on a list and that river river actually call them or have you know whether to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but or do whatever you want to get to the more scientific stuff yeah\nSure I'm I'm not sure if a lot of people carpet your mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan and\nI Know when he smoked doping\nYeah they're they're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is a\nVery logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful white says things about like a a guy and a thriving addict augmentation and stuff and uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are\nPretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability you know the\nMassive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just make philosophy classes to learn how to properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nIt's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nTo have to write it or it can do it if it's not that it's dance or something so advanced to offer you don't have to\nGo [laughter] but you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions are big I'm big on sustainability\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I\nI think that reveal much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine is\nYes some big in the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I own\nVenus is are you know I read about it if that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nAnd so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after the Joe Rogan interview\nGetting interviews and it has recovered mostly what I live in a day or something like that won't affect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I in my argument would be that ... we I invested in ... mosque mhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minutes interview\nOn his dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I'm when she\nWas we'll circling me and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so\nI'm I I think anytime\nThe head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they lived their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use it to ingenious\nI think he exposed himself a little more on it in ... on public but I mean I think the process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or\nNot\nHe claims that that's a that's a very soon and future you know blame on the Web based in June of Nineteen you know what I mean not that good but they were mentally getting more technical logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that stuff this could be a thing in the next ten Fifteen Years you know who knows what\nI Hope we don't get to a Blade Runner in the next year because it's very dark and rainy world\n[laughter] it'd be very depressing [laughter] already Mann agrees and it's nice talking with you let me go to\nMichael in Virginia Beach on coast to coast for open lines Michael\nWe're by your ...\n\nTake all our Brian broadcasting stations everywhere on your mobile phone watching loaded radio ... dot com sixteen twenty\nRecord breaking a walk off love jak hell and Fox News the longest game of the world series history I think just a few minutes ago and dramatic fashion [noise]\n\nYou'll luck with the call on Fox ... sees home recovering seven hours twenty minutes after the game started making the Dodgers three to two winners\nRed Sox still leave the world series two games to one game for later tonight in LA the FBI says the fourteen devices build a leading Democrats this week we're potentially working bombs that suspected of sending them metal in custody a latent\nFingerprint from a package tend to California congresswoman Maxine Waters plus other DNA evidence help police identify things are say act that fifty six year old Florida resident accused of sending more than a dozen dangerous packages to former President Obama Hillary Clinton and other high profile Democrats\nBut we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nFBI Director Christopher Wray says to packages each contains six inches of PVC pipe ...

or is a victim of\nTheir own artificial intelligence and they may have progressed on our um well our understanding of concept\nI'm Still investigating this possibility by the way\nI don't know yet how do you investigate that\n[noise] okay um okay you know what an experience or or\nYou know okay a un contacted yeah okay\nWell that's how I investigate as far as validating or vetting\nWhat I come up to ... what kind of ... um what kind of information I get 'cause I have to check out everything at least\nA from two different thoughts and her mother and her friends as well that may be a knowledgeable in this area\nBecause it's a very compelling idea that that uh maybe if we're if we're worried on this planet that artificial intelligence could overrun us and deprive us of our humanity and eventually\nMake us into something other than what we are just to serve it to to some to know if that if that ... that can happen here that we're worried about why don't we think it could happen somewhere else another and I think it's actually a really great idea for a movie\nI think it's really it's really interesting\nYou might want to consider what if it did happen somewhere else and it came here and now it's running it's game on us and we're building the very thing that it is\nI'm game I'm In great ah interesting I don't think it was that I Would think about it before I go to bed

wildcard line before the bottom of the hour walk\nA lot of ... and it's nice to talk to\nYour wife [laughter] I think you know\nWhy I thought I wanted to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible and uh I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I'm shuttles them subsequently become an atheist agnostic and not so I don't know what to say that you're really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in that space during the week so that kinda bleeds throughout the year I'm afraid if\nYou shut off when you said that job you know people come out of church and they act like an atheist and arrange to nominate this because ah\nI Can't possibly believe in the ... and my God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up\nYou know in the Bible up you know I can I possibly believe in Jehovah when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about high shoulder or a sense of ... first born Egypt change or the great flood\nOr Saddam ain't got more of their own ... innocent children killed there so I mean\nYeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative\nAs being the defining story so I accept what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is I mean and so you know everybody puts their faith in something\nLet me just put it that way well everybody puts their faith in something [noise]\nWould you pay the money put your season sex you put your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nAnd some people put their faith in having the perfect body or or that they that that are going to have the perfect career and that's how they build the structure of their life around that that's really what their God little she becomes\nPerfectly fine I mean that's freedom people will do that I don't see anything wrong with that it's just not how I Choose to do it and then we'll just leave it there so that's our hey gosh darn it we're almost done we could open lines coming up next to coast to coast am this is the ... [noise]\nI don't know I Am a question about it right but the temperature and the addition that I bought it because it lasted the second to last that I first want to ask are you in Manhattan, Kansas now\nNot yet but he's rescuing I'm just I'm I'll be there soon I Am still back in the boxes I'm Still in Phoenix with the time being but I'm getting there\nOkay I Will from mission hills Kansas\nTo

get there very often but one of these days on July I Am a I'm a\nHilton Head only real yeah we're neighbors OK well\nPrevious caller brought up something about that it up a website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure I'm let's go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was elected they asked now\nThat's what it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections than I ever got to heart\nBut yes he did say that it's all immediately triggered him my brains I bought this perfect set of encyclopedias for channel that guy from\nThe church mouse [laughter] or and I was so excited and when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for\nA first part the first introductory part\nAnd it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan\nWow and then you're going to if you haven't stand is you would probably intrigued by it\nBut then in ... lane at this with a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica\nAnd they created the alphabetical volumes and they they chose to put it at length in that heart and then they end that the other\nSelections at their discretion and so when you look at Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica it has just a few little paragraphs and it it\nCosts to them that that go figure someone who might have live during a certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in India are more information\nAnd then if you try to Islam it is like page after page after page in the regular section and so do you know anything about it\nNo that's very interesting it's very ... it was you could look over your shoulder will you talk to you you do in the\nSenate box there you know and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel\nLike like they're not really\nEven [laughter] you don't you don't see the real here's your judging me choose the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said I\nI I Know there are still printing they must you'll be printing a version of means nothing done completely they don't want anything\nAfter the second trip to laugh aloud to buy it gave them home no worse at like at home and all that and I started looking up things like well why don't you can make it this way and so yeah you find out I mean if you could do home or on\nTo serve all take a look at that I'm breathing treatment that ideas so that'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night uh I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night\nAn otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving ... may have to wait a while but let me see what I could do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska on coast to coast am he Karen\nHi um this link and she was just saying and it ties in with last night there was some gas and um it the show was short um first of all I wanted to state you are by far my favorite other than to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though it comes with age [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just\nYou know I I I guess that it's funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like ... you will you know used to say that I'm a trail\nWhat what I wanted to change the subject to and like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things and I'll get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where um that Mandela Effect first of all you've probably heard about it\nThere yet the only memory you\nWill laugh when will they think of memory and everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was like they out and having sex in the Bible the wolf and the lamb\nVersus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb but a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible you can find a gift to what I got catalog in the mail today\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like minded I dunno thrower comforter stir remember what it was but anyway it was the way we will remember that so Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father\nLuke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate Sally Field you remember when she\nSaid her really liked me like

paragraphs about ... pages and pages demonic last night and I agree with us it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that they're earning baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know Cornel into another dimension\nOr anything demon\nInto our yeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside

that we would certainly do she'll do will be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because you know nightmares more\nBut here's here's what I Want to use it on proposed to do the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam and above bendel and about uh Mohammed\nIs that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held\nWe might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but then more people repeat it and that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect\nIs very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples\nUm I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect translation into English from Hebrew in Greek ducked from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek it's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns in people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a permanent and putting a person's name and\nThen others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore um and so we have to quibble inform\nThe thing was a verb for a long time I am facing and we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's when I'll be ... ... ... ... I Hope not for politically correct purposes\nBut because it's just a matter of getting it correct which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um I'm Marty who's in Tulsa and the time

with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft and Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer about the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before\nSerial killer about the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James ... some of you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out\nHe wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like you know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up and then something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know\nI'm not saying Larry King a vampire but I was looking at him behind home plate and I'm just saying this um he may not be a vampire but long after\nI'm dead Larry King will be onto a wife number not with another round of kids and still be home plate\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is that it's really\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got a finger in this whole neural net\nA business is the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman net think of it I think of it as a fisherman ... so you inject it into\nThe brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this girl on that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn must be thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosque is foreseen\nIs the day when we ... with the use of one of these narrowing that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so\nI think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talked about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a a a person's entire a lifetime\nHistory of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic we wrote about that tonight we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic that will ... is the kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it will be but I think these other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said too but it's been a ... I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier\nBut that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know the ... if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nBecause you know if we ... we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter] can go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh no absolutely\nAnd and you're right that this book deals with\nWe're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city and to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about high in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNow these are things that are now becoming realize and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... that we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now\nAt will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell in ... I'm reminded of the ... the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla\nAnd ... and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approach in this because\nThis book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the officer really important in there to show you know just because we're on the threshold of doing some things aren't we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credited with their idea um and you know they said basically you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this but\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect face in their ...\nIt's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes that you can imagine\nOh no it's I mean I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it and so I had become a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my faith very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets of faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ditch the plastic studies so much so that the pope route and fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list next on coast to coast am [noise]\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about about the idea of preserving physical life on this planet\nIs like whether that was due uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something\nYou know even that it makes me question whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\nYeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know ... and never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there is such a good way in\nCalifornia right there's a company in California that is um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff cause you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most shards policy so a lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and\nSo I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know\nThat we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking them they were taking it in the behind and\nAnd and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use in that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured it the late night show so\nI'm trying to get all you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife got tied the white you that was a U.S uh [laughter]\nBut um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling book out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers and a Google executive uh and and others who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging out at ... ... ... ... ... ... ... because yes the idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophies right it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believes that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park\nWhen he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they ... they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral elites any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society gets the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff\nYou know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the clash that's perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance this ... ... it has to there has\nTo be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from H. G. wells time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no ... it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when\nIn fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jet Blue and was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I show I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he\nJust not just a job and you know he has though how is that right is appointed and his answer I thought he was gonna say oh yeah you know I majored in\nAt college right now you know [laughter] but now you got for him but yeah it's interesting\n... you know you know [laughter] but no\nJob for him but yeah it's interesting I I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nWere designed doing work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious belief five for a moment let's just talk like strictly\nScience sure um ... what what were you learn is that oh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that dinner and then I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know how long\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half with the staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we can improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nWell and here's an age now let me up a little differently if there was a human's killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nNow know the fact that they you know some giant bird in New Zealand laid these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so I mean it's going so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian arguments with that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that barren Brunner back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be\nThat's when I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... I didn't becomes downright scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more facile\n[noise] yeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about of these the extinction efforts that are going on right now I'm that ... primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nAnd I I remember when I was at ABC News I was actually invited to come to Russia where there there there were a group of scientists I think the French guy was in charge of the group as I recall and\n\nWon't call it the fairness doctrine but it's still going to be coming from Roche stay alert stay tuned to rush in Lebanon WTO don't\n... the night behind bars I'm Jane ...

from coast to coast and wide on the Internet this east coast to coast am with ... [noise]\nWell you know with a book like the end of life as we know it [noise] I think the bumper was pretty predictable it's like a law uh but still a great job after all these years Michael Gilliland\nIs the author of this book the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science we'll we'll get back to some of the other things that he's concerned about the book is not all doom and gloom industry pretty exciting fun interesting things that are coming from the frontiers of science and in a couple of things we want to keep\nAn eye on I'm saying about you [noise] uh and uh and it\nWill be the end of life as we know what life will carry on but what will it be like we'll talk more about that just admitted also will bring you in on the conversation at the bottom of the hour we'll give the numbers at the bottom of the hour the next hour we go to open lines cause it's friday\nGeorgia's got the night off I'm sitting in and uh and I want to get back to some of those go stories that are up the coast to coast am dot com so I'm giving you the heads up\nTo look for that story about the ghost that moved the jar you can see the video it's it's in the carousel as we call it the you know the rotating stories of the top of the fold the website it goes to close to him to come watch that before we get\nTo open lines next door I'd love to hear your explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science she won\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about a about ... to about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\nWe've got a great feeling stories of or in the house one of\nThose botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David you're a guy that has overcome severe issue\nI went to light the light bulb went on and I started to research amount of say ... yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing him back and it's been almost eight years now\nHow did you did you take the liquid did you take the cat\nI was going through capsules like or I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better\nSoon after you begin taking the council you kind of felt this was going to be a good thing\n... St Martin I can only tell you one thing the product war and not only works in one way it works in a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy and it gives me vitality Karen I'm In my house or\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it\nSo we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that a a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting that much mechanical heart in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and you are junk and\nAnd and and and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a we're even getting past the mechanical heart\nHey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but there you are [laughter]\nNo you know the minute University of Minnesota's monster recently do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... ... they're sheep human and pick human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA and they're creating these creatures\nBecause they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discussed is the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too\nLittle human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now\nBecause of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later\nThat we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility says it's not like you know made up pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is the possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um\n[noise] yeah ah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just pushed the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what\nAre the guidelines what are the guard rails I'm sure\nI'm sure these guys are not just to get a violation of the agent probably doing it against the advice of their moms [laughter] what do you do\nYeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then montebello which has a town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen\nAnd I look back and I'm Out there and the garage that the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know below I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects a law just to see what happens ethic oh I was a little Mad Science\nSo little insects law just to see what happens ethic\nI was eight in the mad scientist and create your own\nSpace program against their will right by the way\nThat they can marry you're right the mothers I say why don't you know right in that already go someplace to Italy waiting\nFor something safer\n... as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding\nMe know so I didn't know what I didn't mean standing fifteens inning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of works and so I don't know I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... that's ... that's how it was happening but right now still there's\nTwo men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it so\nSorry Joe ... is the island to Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is\nBut I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know for Siri\nYou know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on windows Siri is it snowing you know or you know Google ... by me soon you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials or the ... everybody's focused on that type of it's just and I kinda get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the down side of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things\nTo worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about our fell okay you're a ... if you're absolutely\nRight I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know there's a\nDoll house fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me ... that take away I mean you know leaders [laughter] yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming authority ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in\nThe end of life as we know it in a few but but that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and\nRecord his torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way\nBut however it happened that kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on now we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nSaying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nTheater that kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now a more than a billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show anything in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry the end of life as we know it might go deal in next on the coast to coast am in for George ... on it [noise]\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit that was one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data\nFrom the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the Huston and then and then other things started happening with\nFacebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on\nEvery aspects of our life that can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves in we're well these gadgets\nYeah and I like him a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh did you know they always do you know ...\n... did lead to the uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing they do listen to the good the kind of killer because of the ...\nThe hard part would be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system which accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face print\nRight or that they don't you cover in\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy room with\nWhich raises the possibility that you and I\nGot to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using\nTo id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me a perfectly good ah oh eight at night on\nMy own turned back up\nTo go and get a question from Michael\nYes Michael and I heard you are speaking about the ah Jarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there was a whistle blower\nThis call them coast to coast and before but uh it's been great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things\nI'm One of the um the\nPredecessors of that artificial heart was a a heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd ... years earlier and he\nAnd his career as a heart surgery I had some paranormal experience is one of which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do\nThat basically a ... or whatever it was ... right in his mind and he did the surgery or from those instructions that he was able to see it in his mind and later I\nGot to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open mind called the sounds more like ... did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah um I'll watch wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew we had our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of blown\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\n... Michael I got one question for you here where does it and where did you just stop why do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we it's a good question I mean are we playing God yet and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was\nIn the thick of it and this this is directly an answer to trace is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture\nA child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite\nYou know you pick your you you pick your imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nThat Canadian within right there but does everything else\nBut I think that's the crux to um the playing God premise are we\nThe crux two of the playing God premise\nAre we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and yours is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place for it\nRight and that's what I'm saying I just it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... for what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nI what I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil field a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get their way through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI got there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mind that it's gonna do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine\nBut I if I say all it takes for us to do with the step on that one mind that won the hidden mine and it's just gonna blow us up\nOkay remains to be thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I met in\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics let me just give you\nWould I think is a better metaphor though for a for a science and this is is we had to get you had you know let's say that the goal was the other side of that minefield\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and enough scientist run through the mine field the goal will be achieved [noise]\nYou know there there will be some casualties along the way as their inevitably are the the the premise that I'm most worried about is not whether we get blown up in the mine field", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "27"}
