you were really ... in here you are but I've got to tell you a great story you've been on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me\nYou did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that were working the whole by the radio in in you did this incredible thing and I got emails that night in for the following week from people who said\nOh my God my watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this is ... years later we re ran part of that program on our weekend shows and I started getting emails from people\nAfter that Shane George my watches are working my clock is working and I'm going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we re run that show a couple of days before that the power of what you did was unbelievable\nYes you know George ... people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken won't you his old clothes and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat\nThe same experience sure and so people think that he's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and\nAnd they come out of the radio and TV but he really know what I Do eat them simply trigger I'm I'm simply and it\nKept release to the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers them big t._v. shows they actually work\nStarted my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first beat television show and\nThey handed me for\nTwo band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera and I said everybody at home going get your spoons\nAnd get broken watch it I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen because everyone wanted to experience these and nominate\nFirst of all no one believed that spoons and for are going to bend and watches we've come alive but they never they list they brought this food they broke broken launches in ... I mean it was\nMessy and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream\nThree times one two three work work work and lo and behold it\nIf they if they don't want to hurt exactly what happened to you people from all over her England way of in Scotland and Ireland [noise] you know there you you didn't have then um you know Twitter in face time and [noise] you\nAnd um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more\nMy phone was old fashioned black phone\nAnd what happened is the BBC's ... system could then take\nThe hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain any collapse and the next day of course I was kind of the most famous person in in England the\nNewspapers ran headline stories or we get our puts England in a band so ... years George I thought that I did\nIt I really believe that I admitted in energy that fix broken clerks and bend spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles UCLA\nAnd dumped them a mall mhm invited me to her class and of course I did my my act and I left when I didn't know George is that she secretly recorded me while and I went back from New York two weeks later she took that heavy video\nRemember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six [noise]\nAnd she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils student with broken want you and lo and behold there watches started picking from that video now she\nCalls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken watch anything they'll send you live and I said no way what are you talking about\nI'm In New York I didn't even know that you you're doing this experiment and that plenty dawned on me that it's basically I'm a trigger army capital east I mean they may color to the power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people just for us to our gas it was amazing I first met retailer back in Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest at the Jewish community center do you remember remember that time Henri yes I Do\nIn a just a great time the place was packed in a I got region formation and had him on my local show when I was the night talk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay when it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus and you could see out we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the Cyprus yes\nAnd he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel\nWith a Thirteen rooms\nAnd Mossad these renting tangents services\nThey found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel\nInto ... into a more safe house so spies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teacher geology ... but they were really more of the agents that we're from Cyprus where a flying out to\nSyria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems and ... if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about ... fighting with greet people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blown up I I I mean\nNot doing anything out of Mormons\nI've seen everything uh curfews booms exploding or so\nBeing at that age it really changes your life so I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing ... the British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks but why all this was going on I was a I befriended the Mossad agent who told me\nTo you know run errands for him he would send me letters we she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in\nThe Israeli conflict anyhow the reason I told you the story is because I already was excited about you know the the then life for fear of spy\nYeah and I love movies so to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel I met Tom Goldman Meyer who is the\nPrime minister right\nAnd she introduced me to Ari Sharon you know these are all your gender rose in that they aren't sure and introduced me to be intelligent um community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break and let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly room in the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the three Geller the paranormal as The Mentalist next on coast to coast day on\nThe website is now streamlined for mobile devices great news if your ... simply want to enjoy our website on your moon visit coast to coast am don't come on your iPhone or Android rose or\nYes they introduced me to the head of a most out or they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities\nAnd they picked up the phone in the cold the CIA and he was a CIA scientists quote kitten green who took the coal\nBasically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of where we gather produced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it um my website is already gathered dot com and\nUm they asked the CIA to test me\nThey wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how can they put the occurs and in Nineteen Seventy two I left the insurance trade to California to Palo Alto through Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous\nA laboratory controlled condition tests [noise] ah and then I started I'm working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some\nOf the documents um that concern me\nAnd it was amazing when you know the press\nTo hold of this story any ... worldwide\nYes and in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parity cages are there there was experiments where kids green held\nBook in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phone then and note Twitter and Instagram and I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also worked on that page um their word architectural and I wrote the same word\nIn Palo Alto in California so [noise] yeah that's the answer that I work very hard to see these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were a United States touring and uh you know when I was watching on television and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he\nHe you know kind of um ... into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee flew me to Geneva we've them by their ... uh next to me stood out Gore and\nI was instructed to boom barred usually vote on so\nTo sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course I was briefed\nBy by these people in London and um I go to a very close to your early vote on so I mean I was inches\nAway from his head and I ...

that I eat eat only happen because of me there are other elements involved but I was definitely an instigator I was in motivator and I use these powers to convince the Russians to go ahead and signed a treaty\nAbout a year ago President Trump released some JFK documents and then later on released some more there's still a lot that still have been suppressed Henri but sure enough we uh we read that worry Geller was asked to look at the gym came files\nYes what happened is why I was I'm working for some CIA\nOperators and my handler is\nIn Mexico city it was very kind of genius how they got me into Mexico I was introduced to the president of Mexico or look ... and his wife or\nHis wife was kind of fell in love with the powers and you know she loves the paranormal in the supernatural [noise]

asked to spy on the Russian\nEmbassy in Mexico city to see who goes in who goes out where they were there American spies going in um people who betrayed the country and so forth\nAnd one of my task was to find out these new Harvey all vote actually visited that that embassy or consulate\nThere was some controversy about that because there was a picture of what was supposed to be Lee Harvey Oswald coming outside of the embassy but a lot of people were you said that's not him but so go ahead\nYeah well that was my task was to tell them whether that was him or not\nBut there there were more more in much deeper things in Mexico that I did for the CIA [noise] it was amazing I I actually love the by the way I never got paid for this I did it out of ideological reasons and uh I Love these showbiz\nNascent cloak and dagger a there I was on Johnny Carson in Merv Griffin Mike Douglas and then yet I was doing these secret stuff\nFor also for him I five in the in London but by the way

cardamom tumble and if you remember him right to a movie actor and ... for Johnny wasn't bend enough\nAnd um I I was really kind of sweat team and the only thought that rambled in my mind was when we

tomorrow morning and I'll pack up and go back to Israel but if if anything happened I wake up in the morning the phone rings in my room\nAnd the operator downstairs tells me that there's a man called Merv Griffin on the line for me\nSo I said you mean the Merv Griffin because I knew them I knew the names she says he says that's who he is a so see she switches the moan and he says to me or I gather I watched you in Johnny Carson last night I Want you on my show this week and that's when I realized\nThat would also co wine that said a hundred years ago that there is only one worst thing in life

I mean\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting\nEvent all the time from across in and send it to the possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement in the particle lab\nYou're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that\nBut one must never feel that you're without devices that you're without tools in the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people\nAll the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive a meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have\nRecorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened what the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was what happened here which talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one can imagine what they have they didn't have a few good songs\nThey really did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and\nI was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys George it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientist which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the interest that and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post which credit\nIncluded this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose from linear time this is\nWhy I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seem to be off in the future so to speak with my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was\nThere a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played shook his boy on television\nRight that's right and and still touring still touring\nThe yeah they're still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter] and do you know the name ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know\nHe he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas ... groups of people mhm any which is trying to prove\nThat positive thinking in the mind\nHas a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convincing these convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook is been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties JPEG is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book but it's monumental that when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive\nTheir scores spike when they were\nYeah it's like when they were a positive their scores bike when they were bored when they were downcast when they were ... their scores dip and it was inevitable\nSpike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't have to be Las Vegas down and you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again that's one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really want it\nYou must really wanted if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas where the lottery or money or whatever it's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to truly identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power\nThere because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself and I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research why don't I write about the methods why didn't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques\nAnd it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and\nI just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life how powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean\nWe don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have a natural experiments that the thoughts change the brain your sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter\nSo if fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method at work they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project it one of the things that I read about on the book is that we live\nWithin a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity\nBut you're going to experience gravity differently on earth than you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by math the mind is the same way circumstances are\nGoing to intrude upon how we experience these things so we wouldn't that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMitch are going to come back and talk more about your work the miracle club

become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is pie fit into this Mitch you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is without question\nYou know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious psychological research serious experiments anti ESP pre cognition telepathy\nAnd George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways that we\nReceive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical that the mind has an existence outside the sense a body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize\nWe are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us half way and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. riding the grade ESP researcher found that\nESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our\nSelf help systems you must wanted\nWith everything in you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions do we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship\nWhen what we really want maybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we\nGet down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what\nYou want over time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves what we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging people\nMight urging people and this is something list ers can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest once think about this well on this be\nPrivate about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really\nPassionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secret that story or is that different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because I don't believe we live under one\nMental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying in the previous segment so I think it's a mistake to think that\nOur minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect\nThis is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say\nGee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is\nYou may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time [noise] linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that life is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish the two of events occurring at once and we select among them\nSo it could be that we are selecting among the events past present future\nAll the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us but I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself\nYou may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's when they come back to that well [laughter]\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that thought based on what you said you know and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically\nRight out a pledge that for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass it make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just\nTry to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days see what\nHappens when you give thirty days to the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and when you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will visualize a list of people who have written in yes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need to know whether it's a new job in a\nSwitch and something people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that anyway one how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back after the fact\nAnd I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back after the fact and people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling so depressed than facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that I'm prescribing they can't\nDirect their minds in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance that's one prayer comes in that one prayer comes in prayer is\nAn escape hatch from the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life's circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch from our own psyche so again I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework the tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds in the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from\nGreek and they can't do the things on saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that we're prayer comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the marrow club\nIs new one as powerful as the many when you are dealing with miracles\nThat's a

different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city but they just can't seem to get ahead and this will lead me to my second question\nAh people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I wanted to bring up the horrendous car crash in\nSchool Harry New York where ...\n... ... I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives\nYou know one because there was evidence before the crash that something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap but these those people Mr Horwitz above\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end\nAnd yet you say a from a higher exalted background that people should know but that that they were like many people are in society\nThey they were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say\nThis has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like sheep to say if they went to their deaths sort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city and seen my fellow city residents ... many of them\nGood enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tie this together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this that and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we had the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside the blue mold ...\nThere are indications that the the car was basically to use my term coming apart that the uh people were saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk to\nThe car was being calming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many\nComing apart the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher ... middle class jobs where they should\nHave had the smart but no out just to say I want to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know a because you've hurt me before meat cheap oh that driver would\nHave pulled over no band or be I I Would have wanted to be in that limo would you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things I write in the book is you know as I've been eluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces and I've never including love accident including accidents of birth for example now peer pressure as\nAs Keith was alluding is an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous\nIt's vitally vitally important that everybody act with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is that\nThe mind is one vital element that participates that\nParticipates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there\nAre but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive in motor function and that is true\nBut there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind as extra physical properties\nAnd that doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything and every force that occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages use it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be hazardous never\nFeel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to ... in California you know like I'm going like\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview what your gallery I'm very grateful that you and ...\nComment and question I'd like to share a miracle short you know I regularly listen to an audio program\nIn which you match married her nap audio program as\nNational Guard or ... oh yeah for its all year round you and job I Hope you write about mental Goddard and your upcoming book miracle club I Do have a whole chapter on them called mirror man if one of the longest chapters in the book actually oh fantastic fantastic I just love\nNarrow National Guard and his whole idea that your imagination has your reality yes really the outside of events but it's your own human imagination yes creates your reality\nYes yes devil is truly my hero and for any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd as the caller was describing metal taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor\nFor your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing it right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you as you are ultimately rooted in God and that\nEverything that happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here in now is\nReally you're a motive thoughts of mental pictures pushed out into the world so that was never teaching that your imagination is God he was very simple it was very practical and I write about him and the miracle club he has been the greatest source of inspiration in my life\nMitch or would you give us your Web sites and folks and how they can get this membership card into the miracle clump again\nOh sure thing website is Mitch Horowitz dot com if you just throw my name into Google or whatever search engine you'll find it if you go to the ... my email is there

can lose weight you can get stronger or you can do all kinds of things he's using the power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details and the miracle club is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen\nLanger she did a study on the hotel maids she found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic ... healthy and then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing\nShe found the group that had been educated about the aerobic benefits of their jobs actually lost weight they didn't do anything differently they were just ... me to realize that their jobs or anaerobic Lee and robustly healthy\nThey lost weight and

our final segment with Mitch for which we talked about his words the miracle club the books are available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work Mitch and what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road tested and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture\nI made the determination I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club that once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once if you can actually enter into a relaxed meditative state and\nPicture of yourself into the scene going back giving advice to your younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe want to dispense a piece of advice it can change your life right here and now in the presence but be careful because\nSometimes things that we experience as challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson\nSo reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene\nImagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of vague compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different\nI think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we are race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital were necessary lessons sometimes the aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game\nThis is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence you want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch ... or\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select\nThings I think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super\nPosition and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience it as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so\nOur actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience\nThat we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state select\nVery carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Barry in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line ... go ahead\nHello there and your what a player like these are yeah Schmidt chart which a lot of it is to hear you on the air I Love it when you're old coast to coast\nYou're stuck in a day in the Persian real the same way thank you so much appreciate it [laughter] oh I hear by not positive thinkers story\nOr your Georgia man at All right I used to play a lot of poker I used to play for five days and nights a week and that's a lot\nOf them they live and play above ... I didn't realize for for years all of a sudden one night I was there a poker game when I was there a bomb download I haven't had a bad day at work\nI was down three or four hundred dollars a game I got up to ... to the bathroom\nLook mayor and all of a sudden they know all they all are buried problem with you is your second about negative things you're thinking of that they were all bummed out you need to change right now and I did yours\nOr more hours three or four hundred dollar yup\nIt works it works that is wonderful you know that is something to thank you very much for sharing that story that is something called the mirror technique which clawed Bristol wrote about it\nFor sharing that story that is something called the mirror technique which club Bristol wrote about and I think George is familiar with you if you look in a mirror look yourself\nSquarely in the uh in a mirror and state in a positive manner what you want to occur it seems to have an effective magnifying your psyche glug Bristol called it the\nMirror effect it's so simple it's too simple not to try just as a friend was describing golden room or looking at him or you can do it right now and just a surge in an emotionally\nPersuasive way this\nIs going to happen this is going to unfold be positive be productive there's something about gazing at yourself in the mirror that seems to magnify the effects of the psyche just like the caller was describing\nWe now go to any in Alabama low any\nTeacher at large sure the morning I turned the state or federal enough to go off\nI don't know but go ahead and you hear me All right I'm hearing you sure you\nKnow they say hey you better medical miracle where I came out of a cardiac arrest them Nazi financial miracle to\nAn eye on the medical miracle I had been working real hard not to eat and I didn't carpenter work here and no I was hanging in there where I didn't feel I was just how great it out so I decided that he didn't he asked me and I said early on in ...\nIn my blood pressure\nRight at the time when I was on the blood pressure monitor I had a ... year old Mike Rowe\nAnd that change happened in my ... and realized it was happening in a while and I couldn't get my blood pressure any other time yes I think they now lane just now there are quite yet I had no blood pressure was enough\nTo cause the adrenalin to restart my heart is the only explanation I Am but I walked out of your land to let them all history\nJeeze anti met Saturday in would fly down take place it is now you're reading and dieting at the same time because it'll kill you it'll make your Saturday and so a lot of your adult cardiac arrest\nAnd other than I had a thank you Amir can I tell you that that much did you make\nThem all\nLost all my money your identity theft and I thought that they had stripped to my house and everything you and I had no painting that oh\nSomehow survive [laughter] and I bought an old computer on E. bay it was supposed to have a lot they didn't tell the sailor out what's going to sell ... letting headed back but\nSomehow I managed to catch a wave on our hearts by hand I felt teacher or wine or something there and I said oh I'm going to make a wish on that wind horse and I realized it or the pitch Dale picture I had to hang in that my aunt Andrea may when she\nHad a similar white horse that I got up and went and got paid shooting up again the research that picture that say on down there is a painting original\nBag wind shine you shine a\nKid they were over a million dollars and I'm trying to sell it now jeeze I'd say that in a computer that's allowed them\nTo send it to us any and you know we'll put it in the studio\n[laughter] Georgia was wrong [laughter]\n[laughter] you know we'll watch it really close [laughter]\nThat is really wild this story about she checked her blood pressure it was so low that she was alarmed and the adrenalin rush itself is what got around to the ambulance absolutely incredible how the body works\nJoe in Long Island New York so to say Joe growing up\nI match hey how you know I was listening to the last show your friend your a gala yeah and uh I was thinking about how he achieved fame and house yet he seems to have maintained\nBut not temple attitude a diverse and ... so I was thinking of Paul Newman was kind of like that he had his uh", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "16"}
