been published and\nAt least Eighteen languages has appeared in hundreds of radio and TV shows all over the planet couple of his books include predictions two thousand Fifteen sixteen and also tend productions two thousand Eighteen\nPlus the U.S mid term election forecasts that he has welcome John if I had drums here John I'd be beating them for you welcome to the program\nBum bum bum bum bum [laughter] not all opera singer and you know if the deep or if you've been\nWell I've been a really busy I've been so busy that I kind of dropped out for about a my last hope bulletins\nCame the eleventh of August and just today I unloaded a forty thousand word Thirteen article a\nWave I called the Sioux nominee to catch up on everything is so much going on and also I was traveling I I was traveling into the deep red state of Arkansas uh-huh to do the art lent is\nConvention and also on the way of ... I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said worse than ever before\nUm but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news and just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state\nAnd uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a a this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned\nAnd ah I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that\nWas basically is happening\nIs a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy their play right now\nIs a is you're honest and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the story in fine which means that dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas\nThe the earth the sign of Capricorn\nSaturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short\nAnd the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran has into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German third rice into being under out of Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle\nAnd uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from\nGetting the house back getting sent back but for what it's not really defining itself is what we know what\nThe resistance is against I hear it every day here because I live in the very heart of it you're a but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern with much more energy to it then it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said\nAh Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen\nAnd of course four years later I said well no it will happen because if you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton\nYou're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your want tearing down and then and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least\nAt least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it it's really quite\nAnd this classic um Iran is confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud\nOr sign it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays\nSimilarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from your cells and you know I've been a long long time first with art and then with the ... I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really a hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at\nWhen I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retro grades it's back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if\nIf red voters red American voters go to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which will be in the early times\nOn hold on for a second John already to break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecast for this year\nShe how close she's coming and uh also march twenty third you're living in Everett, Washington just circle that dates for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the bring home advisor [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBy the way I view some advisor dot com for some home projects and they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different ... names and ah they're all qualified pick the one you want a\nSuperb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen predictions how many have come true alright\nWell are there have been a number I'm the more the most shocking have been my\nMy eighth prophecy what I did is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of some of the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were\nThe the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nI'd definitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was ah you're honest in the last chance sect style that looked at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached\nOr not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise] ah I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both had the danger if not\nOr if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise] so\nAh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters they get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives will uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that\nUm you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that if he survived this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\n... what's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking\nNotes yeah taking off and it's like yeah I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and for us uh\nThey're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the the blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt\nWhite working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few\nPresidential cycles [noise] I Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until the sixth year if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\nA general stronger minister and I\nSaid ten months before Trump was a ... a elected I said in the big upset could happen through their um and so it's it's my sense is that\nThere will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of feet just switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before and it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not at the end of this this this crisis it's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually\nThink of a way to get out of the margins it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly astrology a saying that they're not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade or we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen it was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this ... fighting about that [noise] is it I said\nThe issue of ... and all the small the fighting about that [noise] is it I've said very clearly\nIn my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kevin I Would be picked that um [noise] I I think people are stabbed rushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think really the way it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so a lot\nBut I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two\nMajor corporate establishment will power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass\nRevolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened and so it's possible that after twenty twenty\nThe American people or or the working people people start really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nRecently were on the History Channel reality show called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for

closer to a a war with Iran that's happening [noise] um Syria\nIs an ally of Iran and it is always long story short the the Nostradamus prophecies that are quite clear about this is the two eagle

Syria\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force\nAnd the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um arid organ of or ... the president of turkey and ladder and food and got together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are\nAre are are refugees\nAll crowd that area owns a horrible\nWhat what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the real red staged and film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a\nA R a I had only taking children and use them and some gassing attack that's this story I'm trying to track down and we're going to be broadcast is still the started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime have\nChemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused ah [noise]\nYou know we have thirty Russian warships as this time around\nAnd and the near equal number of American ships crowding eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a\nNuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of the missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nIt could become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm the strategy kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War when the Russians announce they achieved a parody\nIn March first this year a delayed they're putting the delayed his address to the nation Russia and then he so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of the speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themself\nA very very destabilizing move a hardly reported so the Russians declared in March first that\nPretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian\nDefense the same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other side to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened\nAt the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed it was paying half of its money into its big military uh and it collapsed we're doing the same thing\nSo uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and ... who was considered the Swedish Edgar Casey in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and trance\nAnd he he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union\nAnd at least in this economic sense\nThat's true uh with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say for my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with than the country I grew up with\nNo that's not true in in ... in the last minutes we have before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide and that this this intrigues me why are you doing this\nWell I've been watching Anthony Bourdain since two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique rebellious but really an unorthodox way of kind of\nDragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate in and my travels ...\nIt's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach to really meet with people and people break break bread they they they if it's a connection it's ... it's what I was saying earlier in the show how\nWe can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized will have a big bank would have all the red Republicans and the blue Democrats break bread together like Anthony would do so anyway I watched the show I also saw\nThis brilliant man his doing what a lot of potentially brilliant people and he's also seeker\nA spiritual speaker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into easy a rationales of belief he was really questioning thing and of course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well\nAnd it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide because I feel\nAs much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own\nLine really let's talk about that John when we come back in the moment and then we'll take your calls have you on hold just hang right there\nNever was a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes

with you John ... with us we'll get to your calls in just a second I just do one more ... to talk with John about him he's writing a book about the lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and\nBoy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides\nA and both of us committed suicide and the reason I Am speaking to you is because my\nExperience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide most people encounter um basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up\nWith your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of about a whole other dimensions of my life for\nAll these years I've never known this\nWay I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that\nWas not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day and so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park because I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island and San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me as as I could just keep walking a beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible and clear out to see how they're really one there really\nThere are plenty of complementary or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um\nIt was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death so I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat\nUp against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this\nAnd take this with me over the edge and so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing the you know not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little old eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it's leaving the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth tree existence love me existence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely\nIntegral significant and I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death\nInsignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an a it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about\nIt's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the messiah is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right\nThey use me to write themselves and I had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something that looks like she's never done before she pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a little people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I've watched how she touched his cheek\nOn the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe\nOr in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his sins\nAnd all that it's really pretty practice\nAnd and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one and I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much I'm\nA mixed and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ...\nPoint this center of silence and peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you meditation the science of self observation is is what\nWhat more and more I always thought my my work\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with and evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nHuge let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Hope Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing your experience on that but my question John yes\nFor a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world how can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such\nThat they are not enough for dead\nOn a fact dead on\nTouch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and\nI think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise] and uh so my answer to that is\nIf any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting to [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed ... you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not\nOf the marketplace of the world and that was what my teacher taught oh show and that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see
