I you know so it's tough I ... I really liked playing nine from outer space a guilty pleasure [noise] I really love the blob I Know that sounds corny since I'm the host the blob and why does the solid movie I think it's a great movie\nWhat do you think movies like Halloween the extra ... the shining the conjuring and things like that\nYou know I like those movies I think the shining is actually a a an excellent ghost story a you know in addition to uh being I guess it's not ... I mean I don't know if I classify shining at this last year\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and I and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the ring is Twenty years old you know\nSo um [noise] you know it's a you know\nA lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween but first Colleen\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and ... it was really excellent as kind of like the cap and a half trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween you imagine it's been that long my gosh\n[noise]\nAh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing and less from New York and a bunch of other uh [noise] or\nFilms a science fiction\nA heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers and and they were the babysitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story\n... story [laughter] kicked\nIn and uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary math and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek math in spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's ... that's a lawyer Shatner Matt Good Larry I'm\nI Wonder bill feels about that\nYeah I don't know uh but uh you know ... and so what you know it's the fact that it puts a blank you know expression on the mask and then and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to heart you're talking about the conjuring and\nSome of 'em there was a family of films there's an a bell which uh you know the original dog with the wind or having their a basement full of uh\nObject is Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and they and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the back you know a much scarier when it's something you would least expect you know no one would think that that their little raggedy and all is gonna\nGonna try to possess them or ... birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby\nCan you believe that started to leave that either a ... to\nShe was just almost a kid when she started in the movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with the short hair\nRight she sprang Frank Sinatra protege you know\nAnd that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William\nCastle want it to make that movie you know William Castle was the producer of course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know like emerge Joe and uh you know I always see the buzzer ... eat them the uh uh you know all of these uh movie gimmicks\nOf a house on the hill and uh um you know straight jak\nClassics hold on for a second Mr ... had a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nDo have a photo that you think would interest that goes to ... we're always I'm a hunt for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to ... am dot com and most over the media button on the upper navigation bar you'll see the submission options [noise]\nGilligan with his hat you know and we were watching my dad and I think with a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies the kind of be with my dad and that he would be and the recliner watching creature features that I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometime\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand crawl it's embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and and I'm ... I'm I I haven't bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that they still with great jelly and you know are manipulating with liars and I'm sure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put into this perspective of weight\nThere this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something that can make or something to just the torture me this is something for fun\nAnd I think it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward a I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it were ... and not just for all of you know why I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the ... of fantasy though\nUh I think the horror or is it an offshoot of fantasy and so it's ... I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like ah you know monsters and and the robots and engines and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill\nThe original one with Vincent Price\nRight I mean how hot but I wanted to blind\nWoman in the cellar man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go war well when you just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me to you know and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill assure you know in all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and\nAnd uh you know all sorts of things you know I think that that the curiosity for this a cult in the supernatural you\nKnow I think it is probably the genesis or the Steve although a lot of um your your guest on your show who who started watching these uh movies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four Russian\n[noise] you know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre death has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the tech industry and I'm happy with that there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is I think the area is why you know and you go back and watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and took the chainsaw and\nHow weird their house was with all the the mold mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those are really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they would have thought no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lou shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not one to ... did you see in that showers you\nKnow I Know at no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou you you know it's happening but you don't see it\nAt the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of male and that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melon\nAnd Hitchcock is standing there spoke with his channel watching the sound guy you know making all these weird hollow strains down having all these different fruits and vegetables ... done with a a word and as he's walking out the door he says to stop a\nLear which project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know there were a uh fortunately I had a friend who was the ... when a when that movie came out\nAnd he was cleaning up bomb it every single night his job he couldn't handle it cause and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people had had a become accustomed to the founders footage\nPerson you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of all sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that that movie was a that was the director hat final ... and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDry then they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and\nBut creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know it's so nowadays I think that'd be hard to do because of the Internet I guess you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kinda just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dreams skate which I became the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nWith any any our number whenever they\nGo five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw did she got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the bottle do [noise]\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the father just very much it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing\nWith the grief a of a lost all of a spouse or or and a father um and I think it manifested in that\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know you've got like a top hat and kind of frighten ... kind of hair a he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it it didn't\nNever really believe the topic but that wasn't the part of that is why I didn't like that it seemed like a two hours do walk commercial where it was [laughter] the allegory for their depression in their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it [noise]\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you use or even one I think there's two there's two aspects roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to you get All right you get on a roller coaster and you have so much by what you want to get back on her to get\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in for effort want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you your face you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing the real things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by though\nWhat did the demographics of movie goers these days I mean I went to a lot when I was younger and I don't go to nearly as many movies now that I'm grown uh I prefer to see them on video or DVDs or you know streaming you know in the comfort of my house\nI think a lot of people are like that it it's interesting 'cause uh you know I I think that [noise] you know I think they're having a hard time a holding on to a viewing audience I I think that honestly I think we I think that the young

I absolutely love than have them up and pass them was a made on the weekend or the ... the kids who made fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot bans have them and um and when they when a cost to rally or you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage or the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're\nAnd imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy side by an alert you see in a lotta later or eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains of all time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers or a\nNineteen eighty to come back with a goal because the fog uh it's just a so good you know are still many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um Donald pleasant but I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John\nCarpet assumes Halloween the one of them are they live being one of them the fog was one of them so I mean John\nJohn Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if this bill\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know hum heighten the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars from\nThe distribution absolutely\nSo so then I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it and the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see them more effective jobs was the last the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the slight I think it's very easy to over produce or I think it's a horror movie has too much money in it it seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because it's just too much money in it and it looked like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need\nHe looked like a franchise so um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's thought ... like a surprise and and if you can eat the train coming down the track\nNo one is going to knowing shouting who is going to scare you you know so you have to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror film like ... ... grant\nA are incredibly scary and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror film seven thing\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier around he really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he was charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves a year he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes he likes the attention and\nHe likes to paycheck\nTo paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chap when we were just ... just following through all of these Papolos that they've created for him so it it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books not all seem to have that poor type feeling for him a pet cemetery it things like\nThat yeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean like Dan is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I think that a lot of my favorites Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know\nWhat I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he start he just he just keeps writing he he's the just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing\nA and drinking and writing and finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so there's NO PLAN going in\n... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again ... ... there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why\nHis books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director and kind of oil back down to it asked them you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stand as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with ... like the walking dead and things like that\nUh you know it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like oh there every night of the living ... yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the you know or the rubber ears that you hang around your neck or the\nYou know the whatever dead inside the signs and you know it's it's all um it's a\nVery commercial um you know I think that uh you know it's a soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to I spoke to um you know modern zombie movies you know I Know zombie as the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so out of out\nAnd we don't ... you know we're we're in the world of you know we're very politically correct world\nThere there there aren't many a screen villains that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot down mowed down with a guy and and have no uh we you know a repercussion\nRepercussions we're

that people are intrigued by the subject matter they'll go see it\nInteresting to do people make movies for YouTube\nOr people do make movies for YouTube I mean you to having a lot of problems with a

possible also consciousness and healing those will ... would you tell us your story on the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories let's um just want him to step Bruce march or something like\nThat right well in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had\nA some experience of past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark\nA so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark and it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia and he um\n[noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography\nOf this person that the child remembered being and it turns out that that person were shot through the chess in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nOr evidence shawl but it's still compelling\nOur in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who\nUh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak remembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his\nDiapers or I use to change your diapers and it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid's started\nRemembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little testy a parent's got\nA bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car and he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive their car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um\nSurvival of consciousness or identity after ... death\nBut these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\nIt does it's truly remarkable you know remember to study the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots\nAnd the new things about the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was joined us here in ... and the and the doctor ... and uh they took him to a reunion oh a World War two veterans and he knew several of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the Jews\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this ah we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle mantey um\nUm this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets and they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but because you're kind of going into a trance state people start\nTo see things and hear things and experience things and uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity to have the conversation they can see it they can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that\nIdea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special

you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but\nHow those ideas and beliefs inform how we live now and you know we know that people\nBelieve different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rationed rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transform it and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick ... dot com slash BCS and you'll find out why to us

time now my husband of course what was then known believer\nActually he passed away about just three days [noise] um [noise] but before this happened on the surface\nBurial service so on and he'll just says he was going down into the ground yeah [noise] those farm came up\nWith wild and when and everything it just happens so fast and then it stopped it took only a few minutes it was very odd Noah ... and early in the cemetery\nMy son the oldest one said mom when we were getting into the car to go home dad came home with us wow I said what do you mean he got in the car also\nBecause they

George my mother also came to visit it came I you know he was a non believers as I told you\nBut they are able to churchgoers ... good Christian Protestant but they even taught Sunday school sits dumpster in such a thing is he only after seven years this happened he says Alice\nMother came to visit me I said when when we lived on them I won't mention history but I says why didn't you tell me at the same thing if you're telling me he said I didn't want to tell you\nI said well at all about what she stood at the end of our dead and and it got up\nAnd there she was standing at the end of the bad and it ... what what is it you know and she says Tom I Want to know how our isn't doing\n'cause I was six months pregnant when she passed away and she was concerned\nHow like how it's doing she passed away much first he was only fifty\nFour new something too how old are you know well I think for Ninety four good for you\nAnd um the thing is that George I haven't been wind to call it several times\nBecause we listen to you every night my son and I and he's had believe right now like you know no one in five years ago but he's been listening to your program\nAnd he has changed and full of wonderful he believes in an afterlife and so he's not afraid of that thing on like that but I have ... ... you know other children who are did not believe it is they just go to church all the time but you\nKnow they don't believe they don't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having this first attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says just you know\nHow were you what were you raised that\nWay we were raised as Jenny from hot kissing your church is right here right in your heart no formal no no\nYou have to go to a certain church never my dad with my dad was a Roman Catholic my grandma Nelson also and they were the Catholic they were ... but it became a pot is and\nAnd um and then they decided that could end in his late seventies he wanted to become a focus\nAnd as I said that what happened\nHe says because the British people don't go to war they don't seem to be fighting all the time was when you read the Bible\nYou know it's always fighting oh George you know the Bible I I have read the Bible to into Bible school and everything but the thing is this happened to me when I was seven\nYears old 'cause my two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um\nWell when I was in the Catholic so I went to go with him\nSeven o'clock masks on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I can eat also but there was well ever getting dark confession done and I'm I was sitting there at the Pew [noise]\nAnd I passed out\nYour passion I passed out my neck fail on the back of the computer you know yeah so I my breathing was cut off\nYou know you could have died I yeah\nI was that when I met in Asia I mean this is something that to this day you know and even the priest when it came to get me the two and a ... a child I was gonna\nUm but you've been through a lot to me\nWhen and when my two girlfriends Mariah and bring these came up to me when they came back they said oh this is and you know what Jesus was already late outstretched and ... and the angel behind him you know and George I have never seen anything so beautiful\n[laughter] my life and we never add color t._v. or your bowl we had was raised us home back into thirty\nWere in those days that's all you know search\nAnd now I tell you what I got it all and colors and when I hear your caller called in to say they ... they ... they had been up and came back\nI find it very difficult to believe some of the story because my it was not one that I Know what it looks like\nYours was a good business was beautiful George and Jesus so to\nSay we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn and that was recalled Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things couple of things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive\nAnd so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours where people can you hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they had these experiences and there's something to it\nThere's no doubt about that Marilyn we're going to come back and take final phone calls with you just a moment in Dallas you keep calling us from want you to

research some of my colleagues ... and others at the Institute in no attic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium is getting information that is accurate as compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that\nWhen people evaluated the statement made by the medium\nAs having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these medium for creating a space for another set of memories to come in\nI find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's there's all kinds of industries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nEerie Houdini spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with is dead mother he was successful\n[noise] well I think there's been a lot of fraud there's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so you know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of\nFormulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George\nEurope hello George junior high or just ah like I was like a lot of the callers call in or is higher consciousness or\nIs it or humanities destination because of all are ill and are we going that way so is that going to be the only save your\nOr everything that we do and um the lady before a spot on she said the was about the heart and mhm I I find that believe it is just so hard on the sole or heart pills what the soul to do and the soul moves on\nAnd I just want to hear her say about that and the thank you so much I Love the show\nThank you Joe and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pump\nAnd the guy I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question I I we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity and technology but are more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the met a cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their inability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media\nBy our political leaders and just not seeing a lot of uh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that\nWant to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine the light on that\nI think eventually good beach out over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative mobile I Am a little I'm Jewish\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine\nYou know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the amygdala and the fight or flight and\nWe don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions and one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that\nAh we know as people grow older or there is this concern that we lose memory but at the same time we gain wisdom\nSo it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go to first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nTheir village okay thanks\nI just wanted to call because I had this story that I have to listen to the Maryland and uh normally listen to get all night and they'll ever have anything to say you know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one on while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle\nAnd I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember\nGetting hit by a truck or remember hitting the ground and then the next memory that have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down and I can see a circle of people around me waiting on the ground\nAnd I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely an out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you have something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the new women experience the organization of course named after what ... do well big sciences but what is the ... experience me\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reason to kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we know but intuitively we know it and that often can be the most reliable source of guidance for us even though it doesn't have the rational logical kind of documentation to support it\nNonstop we've gone Shelbyville, Kentucky Richard's calling us the rich go ahead\nPlease George Marilyn ... show them the ... the\nStress management university a little for three years\nAnd there was a great little book
