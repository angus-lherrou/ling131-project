F. R. B. ten ten so there you go [noise]\nUh coming up an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenants colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese the Russian Federation under a populist\nThe war with the Russians and the Chinese the Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become\nThe catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nBecause there's absolutely nothing going on right [laughter] I actually remember slow new gate news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nWhen was the last time we had a slow news day open lines in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of Saudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march from Honduras there is the mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk about all that stuff\nBut but\nLet me just throw this log on the fire and I think it's the single most important question out there\nA brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAs you know really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal\nAnd of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems or that really a\nPush against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a\nDefense system weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate\nA the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties you know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower\nUh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like well he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nLet's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how\nThis trade war strategy or terrorists\nNice shade how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there\nIs a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seemed somewhat of a ... you know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but\nThe fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property in in Trump's says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to Chinese\nYou know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that you know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go\nTo China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully gonna meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement and the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out\nTrump you know just like ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that [noise]\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other\nUh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed me is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't if not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence and we're the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and yeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states\nIn the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint at\nPerhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\n... this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare\nUm covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen\nIndicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest\nVery strongly that yes they're representing their interest in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for ... teams time over\nThe last ... for the interruption I got to jump in here will pick up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here is Jimmy hendrix taking us into the break with who do child on coast to coast and\n\nHome title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard it's Russia a given\nTheir provocations but also a their military capability\nWhich they're not shy to exercise around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and you know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place I ... in nuclear submarine and\nAnd I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily or\nIn the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as\nWe know all about the allegations and and justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not\nA you know backing down and that\nAnd given that there's you know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea\nAnd of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting the People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous or China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] well we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas yeah why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind\nYou know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is you know why the U.S Congress\nOr in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there\nI I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nAre that they're the the mere threat the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nAnd I'm twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts of indicators demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and\nArguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the\nAh the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five of course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over a stone ya\nThat that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as your right Claire article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course\nClaire article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one\nOf the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can\nWe declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so um no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need\nThat may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even pollen which is a you know really\nA very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all\nIssues of great uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been\nHearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth a Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president is accused the Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the\nBig concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWhile it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know be a defense secretary Jim Mattis ah put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made you know phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ... you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect or that the Chinese have and somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn\nOn and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building equipment that through\nSecond and third level a contributors to a large an item end up in the U.S military and that's why I think there are a lot of people are concerned you know\n\nHave you got down to service in Oshkosh than you got us on your smartphone launching loaded radio ... sixteen twenty WG a W college do

Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the\nNineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire [noise] ah so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO\nYou know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour\nOr because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well you know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the\nChinese are just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them um but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians in\nMilitary exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging or so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it\nAt this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing to turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made\nAir defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by a given that so much of the narrative of the show gave me\nA murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn

deal but I mean we've been\nNot only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that and we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them\nBut we risk a relationship with a with the\nSaudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons um and the packs\nOf course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nOr otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your

know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms\nSee if what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans from the Iranians but others\nI think are a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um\nI think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in neither country's best interest to not have a I have an agreement that isn't forcible the problem is\nAnd the Russians notice that um Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty with\nA was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that you know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but\nYeah they did talk about that issue and potent realist you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis\nJust solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I I'm pretty you know I I've talked to John Bolton before and so I ... I kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy\nBut he does have the president's ear and I think that that's the that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a ... of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel uh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know\nThose volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become\nAn of a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or you know for me to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of\nWhen I I think that you find that they're not involved with the Hutus are not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia and Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue um but it it if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and you know Palestine and so forth and you know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are\nWonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that or a positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia's well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the ban low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\n\n\n\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five and a glass you in another seven hundred coming up this year uh is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know you know how can\nThe Russians and the Chinese be such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what you're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cost five percent well we went through this sequester ration period in which it just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft and these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships you know it's an incredibly expensive to have an armed forces and you know it reminded me\nOf of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by a\nBoth China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics\nIn artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on a write glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas scheming good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information or I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future you know it's it sounds a little\nParanoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nGreat question Steve is that possible Bob\nWell I'm not an electronics uh no expert however I Do understand the question\nAnd I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable\nAnd reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nAre ships and it's and so forth and we\nCould find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter in the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think there was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we're very concerned about a cyber the battleground cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections you know doing all sorts of\nThings that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to a cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet\nYou know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think\nAll that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWildcard line down his intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n\nHave to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a [noise] you know I I don't know that that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against our interest in those five they claim that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face for years and will not touch the ground\nAnd they will destroy the ram that has the two wars and said that the ladder horn is the bigger on that comes up last than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with a we're actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia ah so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great\nUh and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a competent but he did not use or anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as in a law explained in you know this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentioned that he goes I'm from the west will have her or has the wing husband eagle and those wings will be plugged in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are\nConsidered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob would say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its it's used elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from\nA piece of Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy\nI'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on

Tom is in riverside California Tom good morning good evening welcome to coast\nOver certain uh thanks for taking my call and uh I just wanted to comment on you know I'm a your guest before and uh the last caller\nA and it ... you know I'm I'm not a young person in a [noise] and I've been in this country in a haven't went anywhere around the world at all I have never left the country [noise] and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat uh something has happened to our government a home in the last fifty some years and it seems as though that a lot of people think that uh\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach uh uh you know go defend our our country's three I'm In a charm military\nUh in our military really is and our military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that\nWe're not really in control of our government anymore it seems very obvious and ah it seems like a\nPeople of a you know I of course the younger people don't really you know remember America is it was you know in the fifties and sixties\nAnd uh they've lost touch with you know would they didn't lose touch it just it was it was never a Chevy to them or what came before them in a [noise]\nA a you know a lot of the country is opened up prisons around the world can turn gay people\nI'm not yeah that's not American to me that's not the way I was brought up in America posted to torture people in prison for cross a disease that is that the way it is\nA ... and ah [noise]\nThe the government uh\nStop the draft\nEight oh seven ... kicked around I don't get out of the day at\nTime you're fading out on me hear your your phone is debating on he said something about ending the draft\nYeah the draft shouldn't be ended the draft should be reinstated as what I'm really saying you know that's one problem but I mean here's the problem we're not looking for oh about government anymore and I don't\nBlame Russia do it it seems to me than American\nNever been in the country I was raised in Indiana and you know in the middle of this country\nWhy should I feel this way Kennedy was shot in the head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that uh I was Catholic course I was ... that was a direct assault\nOn or you know a on me and people around and uh the uh the nine eleven and who\nYou know a Richard what's his name you know\nYou said you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that is certainly something changed Kennedy um but has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral trade organizations and\nAh he did all those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warned against foreign entanglements I think what they called they called it\nThis these sorts of\nUm games\nIt's the sorts of um\nGames\nDirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there or\nYou end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's\nDirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption and I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United\nStates and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it\nBut the United states yes\nThey they have been involved if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nIs does this isn't for ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has to do the same thing but they don't reflect\nUpon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption\nAt least in the United states that exists\nWe reflect we're right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better\nAnd I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call a Doug is east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nLike very much for being I'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I tried to get rid of some time ago a it was a guest host them such as yourself and ah they were talking about our climate change in a warming where\nThey're rising to the ocean now I'm not a a I'm not going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that but ah they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which ah that is the fact that there's measurable they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I never heard anybody take into consideration water displacement\nEvery year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant a\nMulti ... a million dollar a cruise ships submarines we're thinking I'm subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs\nWere sinking old military now this is taking up space and uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has stopped for some time and that's also taken a while about taking the water but it's adding land and ah\nI I think if a if anybody a you know of or any of the guests that you've a hat on or hurt to speak about this uh ever brought up the theory of water this place [noise]\n[noise] uh no not that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of\nSea level rise that they're talking about isn't about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because\nYou know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow I'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been ... rising for a very long time or we were in a kind of a trans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age which still technically in a nice age\nWe have ice the north and south poles we always we haven't always had ice up north and south poles so ice is melting were coming out of a a glacial period and water levels have been rising and will continue to rise and I think it's normal but water displacement\nOr we'll have someone on to talk about that thank you cat Stevens taking into the break with city you're on coast to coast more open lines when we continue\nA show I didn't even\nRichard yeah there\nAre many days ... days my ailment there are many and um I have a very important [noise]\nAll right what did you see\nSaw a guy that was very much and I wear\nGod I for one thing I've been in bed so much\nAnd I went through or damage of emotions I was listening to music eighties even a raw milk fats and I worked at the two pictures of the two little girls I have my wall there that can be from saint Jude long ago Gracie and ruined\nAnd they look at them and I just kind of broke down and\nI've never been there many Christian the whole life and I've never been able to handle\nThe pain and like we came home home today to me and\nEven though I ... I have terrible problems and I said father and there's a picture of Jesus Christ of other big little ones cannot suffered and more of this cannot go on\nI was just all this ... this was going to go on for years and decades decades hundreds of years and I said it can't go on\nLike solve the problem is\nI looked at the pictures I couldn't believe it live and smiled and daisy and I smiled and the father who was saying to me it's not going to go on\nIt's going to end if people just don't know that it's going to end very soon\nThey are they're going to be standing in place where the lessons are going to be standing laying are sitting in their place and uh they're not going to know that this comes upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that's that's what's coming up my end or\nI'm not

going on a day and I really do believe that maniac and I I don't want to use the cliche that each day I Would call them\nUh I wouldn't call them the maniacal money or as I can tell you that on line the ... maniacal money horrors of the world are going to bring about\nBecause they have said China and Russia to hold out Iran of course the satellite state and they've said you are going to get bogged down to us\nAnd you are going to expect our ways you they accept or corporation in all of a norm or there's gonna be a war and cotton yesterday most Americans missed\nIt when he said it did you catch that Richard when he said Russians when the war crimes if we get a tax she said we're going to go to heaven because Russia is now is\nI didn't catch that that's right and you write\nYou American

I started working back here in the early nineties and I ended up meeting my wife [noise]\nThe mighty ... here at ten ten after we married we had our twin boys you were born [noise]\nThey'll get this the tense month the tenth day October tenth at ten minutes after ten\nAllotted tens in our family\nAnd of course mom and dad met and fell in love at C. F. R. B. ten ten so there you go [noise]\nUh coming up an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of do a Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese the rest\nWalked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese the Russian Federation under a populist opted authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing use nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nBecause there's absolutely nothing going on right [laughter] I actually remember slow new gate news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nWhen was the last time we had a slow news day open lines in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of Saudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march from Honduras there as the mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk about all that stuff\nBut but\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ... and you know putting in of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at it because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems\nUh that really a push against emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a\nDefense system weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate\nA the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion\nHandcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact ... said that once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nIn Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower\nOr not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like well he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it but at the same time he does want stability he does want in the tensions are but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nLet's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war\nHow people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this and the camps to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh I uh cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a death you know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but\nThe fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and\nTrump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to Chinese you know not only cyber attacks but through\nYour company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that you know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the\nPlaying field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other\nUh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed me is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedge many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy is it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence and we're the nation is as opposed to know what they would call and a moral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that\nIn fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and yeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states\nIn the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint at\nPerhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march ... they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponized seen everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare\nUm covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for umpteen time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick this up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here as Jimmy hendrix taking us into the break with Bhutto child on coast to coast and [noise]\nSocialize the outcomes than I think you can never get out just sounds email or credit card again usually see do I need to stay safe here down them my hands on ... and get one free\n[noise]\n\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given\nTheir provocations but also a their military capability or which they're not shy to exercise and around the globe\nI'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and you know have said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place I ... a nuclear submarine and\nAnd I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting enough militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as\nWe know all about the allegations and\nIn justifiably are\nThe sanctions put in place because with their interference in the twenty sixteen election\nAnd here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested a someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know\nPresident Trump's not a you know backing down and that are given that there's you know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you\nJoined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea\nAnd of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous or China certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas yeah why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which is in their twenties Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is why the U.S Congress or in the\nNational defense authorization\nAct twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with this platforms and his uh weapons\nAre that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts\nOf indicators that demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and\nArguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening\nOr certainly up until the\nAh the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three or ...\nThat that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more\nAnd yet you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members to we need to all these other little countries you know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been\nAnd tree and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one\nOf the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need\nThat may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a you know really\nA very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nGreat uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been\nHearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth a Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president is accused the Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm\nThe big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the a defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made you know phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ex you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect or that the Chinese have and somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn on\nAnd trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building equipment that through\nSecond and third level a contributors to a a large end item end up in the U.S military and that's why I think there are a lot of people are concerned you know\n\nInterviews with newsmakers bonus to ... times better ... over your review WG a W is on\nFox News alerts billion dollar dreams

of shore has posted that and many other tasty little tidbits All right let's get back into alliance of evil on the other side here on coast to coast yeah [noise]\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now uh you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation\nA air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire [noise] ah so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO\nYou know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour\nOr because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well you know we have that alliance and they keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them um but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and\nMilitary exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging I'm so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts\nOf you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing to turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made\nAir defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by a given that so much of the narrative of the show gave me a murder has come from the Turks and also cutter\nOr another sort of sworn enemy in Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think do anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know kind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes you know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night so I suppose some details will eventually come out\nBut the clandestine type of operations now from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals or even if the show was you know\nDemonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been\nNot only a hundred and tend to and it's far in excess of that and we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them\nBut we risk a relationship with a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons um and the packs of\nCourse distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nUh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who cheese and others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China\nI did and of course as we see is what I called the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans from Iranians but others\nI think are a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um\nI think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do about what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we'll talk to his counterpart about renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in neither country's best interest to not have a I have an agreement that isn't forcible the problem is\nAnd the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty with ...\nUh was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd ah you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I I think that will will get something I Know that you know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but\nYeah they did talk about that issue and potent realist you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they're great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I I'm pretty you know I\nI've talked to John Bolton before and so I I I kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy\nBut he does have the president's ear and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria um and with air to want a ... of course uh the uranium the Iranians are our problem for Israel uh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu\nRevealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs [noise]\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the uranium syrup no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs added there if Iran were to become\nA secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria\nIs it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the ...\nWhen I I think that you find that they're not involved with the who teased for not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia\nAnd Riyadh into Iran it's going to continue\nUm but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in southern Lebanon\nAnd you know encouraging Hamas and you know Palestine and so forth and you know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are\nWonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow up from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the ban low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\n\n\n\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year a it is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but it did enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know you know ... how can\nThe Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and in competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this sequester ration period which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships\nYou know it's an incredibly expensive to have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by a\nBoth China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained the investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence\nOr even in investment in our our blue water navy\nUh uh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on a write glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to Steve West of the Rockies in Las Vegas scheming good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast thing yeah\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping or electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\nWhile I'm not an electronics uh no expert however I Do understand the question\nAnd I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable\nAnd reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there was a wake up call across a certainly the U.S military\nAnd I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt it reminds me of um what's your ... or the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think there was maybe a near collision involved in and I'm I'm ... I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we're very concerned about a cyber the battleground has a cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two\nAnd not only the threat you know of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections\nAnd doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the president's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so\nYou know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWildcard line Don his intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast brother Robert\nHappy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the meanings that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel eight where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that ah that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against\nInterest in those five it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth and will not touch the ground\nAnd they will destroy the ram that has the two horns of the the ladder on is the bigger horn that comes up last than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last torn comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt said that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means there's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with that we're actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia ah so you know it's a and this is a dual application process\nShah uh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a confident but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as in a law explained in you know this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her or has the wing husband eagle\nAnd are those wings will be blocked in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are\nConsidered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are\nA summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob would say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United States Senate it's used elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from\nA piece of Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with um Bible prophecy\nI'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card line and she's in Springfield, Massachusetts Susan good morning welcome to cost\n... having a problem where I live up now on all your radio show and picking up the different subject topic\nA little bird action involving men and yeah you never talk about it you wake up something else I'm am wondering I kill radio shows\nI'm not sure what station you're listening to Susan in what you're hearing but this is coast to coast and for the last well nearly two hours we've been talking with lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis so did you have a question for Bob\nYeah why why do you have any of the ... that their government\nNarrow that down a little bit\n[laughter] that's like you know what your thoughts on that topic and now it's a break and when he came back and talk about something else [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "20"}
