[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd we'll come back to coast to coast smart ... with us author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley a former investment banker with UPS in New York\nHis world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in in the upside down thinking\nThey introduce all a bus to these cutting edge ideas in Syria's on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here which consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the material is science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally native matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter and when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get\nInteractions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry when you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective and if you buy into that which I used to you then when the brain dies consciousness dies\nMemories are gone but when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there's no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in in our science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness ... the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nYou write a book about consciousness showing the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nSo it was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight but I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas\nI was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of that her name is Laura Powers she mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to a different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities\nUtility for consciousness to survive bottle he got things I had no familiarity with an overtime just hearing enough\nDifferent people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real and this was a very\nJarring and disorienting realization\nFor me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness\nMaybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of\nIntense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of\nBasically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting and as I was doing that I told friends over time at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive\nAnd these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also\nSeeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened so it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up\nWriting more than half of the book is now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a hole in the health bill Gladstone who's now my agent and my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nAmong the people that will Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness\nThrough a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nRight without the brain\nDoes consciousness exist at all\nAnd the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no would science back us up\nTo my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body\nSo one example is chapter nine where I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago wasn't near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just to hold his nation that happens when someone about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional where it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens but that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark ... bird dot com is linked up for you at ... dot com the name of his book we're talking about\nIn in the upside down thinking me or read the subtitle dispelling the midst of the brain produces conscious this and the implications for every day life we're gonna take phone calls next hour with mark but I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSilicon nieces pre cognition to let them see how that all works out side of the brain and what's causing\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members did great show up they didn't do anything with those ... ... ... ... dot com slash goes to ... am and we do like what [noise]\n[noise]\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before to lump in the ... cycle ... says you you of course ... learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled studies that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with so much sounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I exam each of these phenomenon is that I read them that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like till after the and the other things will talk about\nAnd I read it in that if any of these phenomena are real\nThe material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo ... to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that he studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the result the statistics are very compelling\nMhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma thick stigma refers to\nStatistical odds against chance when you've got to stick stick my resolve the odds that the that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to want an intellect at the we have six sigma results\nThat the gun thought experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane has given a picture by the experiment yours and the experimenter state game I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room the gate and mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow I'm going to be the ... the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nSure instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender having much to do with it\nI I I think that's a receiver\nMight have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... or communications with the deceased through medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room in simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them\nWhat do you think would happen well well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic\nThen we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult studies to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me on the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and your use psychic spies for national security purposes many of marine I've\nBeen on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which have been declassified recently and the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one remote\nThe phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one but remote viewing\nIs the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes it sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain\nBut if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nUm say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon this is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter] so\nI mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world if I had a consulting case for example that really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me\nAt least made me question things um even further than that there's a page on science channel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech the next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes\nImplications are revolutionary\nEvidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we looked at these uh tell a path to good studies\nAnd I've always wondered if the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine the studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find that there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings\nAnd to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it if something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a pre pocket and dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic design is as follows it it reverses what we look at in psychology typically and in psychology the typical study as you show someone a picture let's say at the neurotic image or a violent picture\nWe know that the body will unconsciously respond to it though the skin respond with pupils dilate the brain and the heart respond what the pre sentiment creek cognition studies have done it to reverse order\nSeven seven for to to to to\nYou heard the news you heard the sports know read and review whatever we said we put it on line this is sixteen twenty WTO W College Station

consolidation loan you have the right to settle your debt for a mere fraction of what you owe reduce a large portion of your debt now\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting system to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise]\nI tell the comment was set up but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week and I had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian and ... and then now\nThere is no one around no um food now animals I was by myself and\nI guess I'm I I like to know people that are tell a path that now you said that people are are usually good with meditation I I haven't got to let them at ... meditation my life but I have been on my own a tremendous amount of time I'm at\nA deep thinker I'm spiritual and I think I'm an empathetic per se so I wanted to know if these qualities allow people to be more palate path again in addition for about twenty two years I've seen\nDouble and triple digit\nI'm On the clock on email addresses license plates and whatnot and the anomaly that has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um I I kind of thinking that this might be a telecast experiences well\nSeeing something like ... to on the clock I'm thinking of important messages you know something important in your life seeing these signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nHolding out awhile ago someone had told me um you know they're in the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe a Bible or some religions it's the\nBody and mind here at all and so I kinda think that what you're saying is differentiating between me and the spirit\nOr the other person is it's outside and the spirit inside [laughter] or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the say what do you think\nIt thank you for your question on ... um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness and each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a whirlpool dissipating and the water does that leave the stream it just transitions into a different state and so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether a localized in a whirlpool or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or its supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that like max plunk he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow is this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to\nA leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off it's over I mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not die on the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think\nA meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish there had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences\nWhat people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain is either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut different the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material good so it will be talked about meeting in life but life review as a potential land if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life\nThat we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness\nPre cognition\n... and things like that well yeah I I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the ... the study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained\nI think there are abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that an understanding human potential and these abilities that we have\nCould revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John and Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nAnd doing great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that\nAgain retired military I was a cyber multinational unit two thousand six and Iraq\nWere by the way thank you for serving or sniper\nCase that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker um we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of the esprit intelligent shop where\nThere was a coal location for a boss and some building\nWere able to find that three you Avi and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer there was brought in\nA was ball and I believe he was an albino which is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli defence from what I can get ... who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that\nAgain I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing because of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality\nIs there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more in tune to remote viewing\nNot ... not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic it just isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and the access to water that's outside\nI wanted to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us yes or\nA ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I a a lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic who will believe if you find the proof [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nNow that's carnivores ... dot com C.

coast to coast our final segment with ... market can we concluded that consciousness\nIs a part of the universe always was and that it survives outside of the physical brain than physical body but it's there it's out there in the east or I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we've discussed night a psychic phenomena like lap at the psycho can he says pre cognition near death experiences children with half life memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's they get that consciousness is playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show\nContinued lesson you thinking this wonderful really wonderful and my uh my question is do you get other got tons of cars\nA reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us\nAnd so they can consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil\nHow this free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nThose free will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question or free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the body having free well are we talking about like the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water\nThan all there is conscious yeah so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is\nConsidering it up to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free world did not exist at the same level that I make that\nYeah it does in on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what our linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know anybody that that we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limited after my understanding falling\nYou think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to deal with is how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how this might have interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose\nAnd his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in in the Senate John Candy so if somebody goes into Las Vegas upbeat positive uh there's a high likelihood they're going to win\nBut if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy I think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nKnow I'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind so who's to say that outcome which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\nUh yes real quickly before a make a statement sure\nI like the uh respect of this disagree with ah that are a few of a bill about the effects of a drug this Bush in the on the mind or you know it's an indicator that consciousness is a product of the mind ...\nI'm a you know if you the\nPerson to speak to him into a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be a consciousness and uh the play back of the tape recorder or you know if the typing wrinkles clinical though something will end up playing it just started a\nVoice or you know distortion that would be an example of the drug mine\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus is I'm bringing about a distortion of what consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know the wholesome of consciousness that\nWent in to it [noise] uh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a a spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so\nYou have a example of active consciousness of as the existing outside of the body that I'm able to live with paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't\nUm you know was able to live with paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise uh till the ... and everything else I think this the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhat do you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center and these studies are use five levels of blinding\nWhere the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased is speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows\nIs the first name of the dead person and they're able to\nBring in non chant information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this they just think that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think in some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there is a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claim to be mediums and maybe there are some broad I think there are some people that\nThat has real abilities\nAnd the wind ... Research Center as one example where they they heavily screened the mediums and these people are able to do things you can explain I'm also looking back historically there are many cases back sometimes from the Eighteen hundreds of people that were studied rigorously one is named listeners piper\nAnd she was studied by William James ... ... the famous psychologist and a detective followed her around to make sure that she couldn't get information from normal sources and she was able to do things that were amazing so I think it's possible that some people have extraordinary abilities\nLet's go west Steven's with us in Eugene Oregon now Hi Stephen\nThat evening you know George were always saying there's no such thing as coincident right now I'm ...

you know I over the years um I've\nYou know you're like addicted to it [laughter]\nMm no not addicted to it but to me when I'm\nYou know investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing that um and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers um and occasionally when I Would go to those fans of time and not actually use that energy I Would tend to when I fly a lot of my

about money it's all about how you're going to serve and help other\nWhen you run into ... do you go with a quip mentioned a number of people\nYes yeah there is a team on over the years that team has changed and has grown and we have a you know\nFew mediums at work with us um we have people that work specialize on the electronics they work with the ... meters on you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long and just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen where you would ... we'd better get out of this thing you know no\nNothing more than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um there's there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare\nThey're still in nursing you know I mean one would say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me you know you have to just\nKeep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time as no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all this uh\nYou know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kinda be aware of\nWhat would you see is the most fascinating case you've been on\nTo date [laughter]\nOh jeeze fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last White House keepers wife Connie small I Believe what's her name\nAnd to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't\nI wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was after we would have done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channeled turf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she could talk to the people around her\nShe I channeled Tourre felt like she just was so excited to be alive again because she can talk to the people around her but to me what really was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times if you know ...\nCentury right that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with 'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation\nUm and once we did that time you know here's this woman ... small her picture as life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt\nA connection to her that I did the next plane\nNo that's got to that's got to be emotional sometimes when you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone than you actually think you know here's a person who lived and died\nAnd you know the remains are right here and then they show up on a ghostly operations attached to that that's going to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I've done reading for people um you know and I've actually\nYou know you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know they're paying and that's our and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm it as much as you probably try to try to stay focused you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely do you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so ... you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions money it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest case you've come across strange ...\nStrangers case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going\nOn because it's to keep me honest right so I'm not Googling mind that information eager for\n'em to one day he gave me a call and say hey more rain you know I have this case at ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take\nAn hour you know ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm sure are on you\nKnow he's very creative right so I said\nOh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we can go to the home it's a little ranch style house and we we get there and if that's meant to guys there\nWant to they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was most and the big big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so why is it is looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered glass table from busted and it just looked like him and went through the house with that\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've my phone's been ringing with all heroes on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all the things he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm\nLike okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes I'm thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of unmanned very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to you and brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um\nThe elite Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy most any rags me down on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you've got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in\nSomething that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she\nSaid and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary and we'll be back in the moment with more on

next guest Ron ...\nRun is the founder and lead investigator of the New England ghost project with a degree in environmental science now he was a skeptic however in near death experience changed all that for him no longer blinded by his skepticism\nUses scientific background now to seek the truth about the unusual in pure normal in addition to hosting ghost chronicles on the ghost village radio when I tunes\nHe hosts a weekly Internet radio show on target net dot com and also has written books with Maureen the ones I'm told told you about more ghost chronicles\nAnd the ghost a de la ... good to talk with you\nThat morning looking forward to this so tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah I I had cut my ah fingers off on a table saw and oh ...\nYeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time so they kinda wrapped them having nice and and kept me an emergency room so they can bring a specialist on them six and a half hours later they put them all back together and ah\nYou know that was fine but during the night um my doctor came up to see me and ... something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called in for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in a hospital was nobody and at that time and they realized they had a blue Murray embolism\nAnd from then on things began to happen in a while it was all going on I had what I Believe was a near death experience and it it's not like the the usual ... here and and that's it was that was just basically in a different place it was extremely bright\nWhite I guess it's the best way to describe it and uh there were a people their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and the [noise] the weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was\nIt sounds really ... enjoy like music it had that\nMhm same type thing and\nUh also it it felt a and there's a line in the ... like a prayer that I always quote and that is if I like home was very comfortable it was very warm and then the whole thing\nJust being disappeared like the closing of an iris and it was in the wall of that\nRight which is and it was just the dock ah ah ICU that I was and there was no music was just my heart beat on the modern or it was a nobody around and certainly wasn't a lot of them so I when I got a hospital I didn't know\nIf it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I got I got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that the it wasn't just the drawings ... there was something really unusual going on here for you\nYou know it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for ... ... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a and yet I just that the experience you know can absolutely tell you it wasn't you know so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other uh things that I Do do they\nReally attached to fingers were they able to do yeah\nYeah oddly enough and uh\nHow many ... to cut off\nI cut the the middle one all on my left hand at the middle and totally off the the\nNext to it I had got several places that was a kind of dangling the top of the fun I head cut off completely uh they actually put a ... when they put together my ah middle thing and so if I ever give anybody the finger I always tell them it's not me [laughter] 'cause it's possess asking that but\nThat was a joke [laughter] ha ha ha at three thirty in the morning it's good [laughter]\nSo it's to the hand works normally yes it's amazing to\nGuide yep it's a you know what the time it's it's a you know a little difficult with the cold but uh yeah it's fine\nNow tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nIt's a a a paranormal group was formed probably about Twenty years ago\nUm when I get out of the hospital was looking for something to do and\nA media one was often a course in TV production of the time because my aunt was in the cast and it was all kinds of blood than us and things so it looked interesting it was a thorough cause but they're not up to complete it you had to do it on\nA a show on something and I spend all had this near death experience I don't know if it was the drugs they gave me a lot and also I own a manufacturing company and my manufacturing company was supposed to be haunted by people that weren't they are in a you know it hurts all kinds\nOf [noise] but anyways I ended up with so I you know what I got to do it all goes as a lock and uh\nThat's how it all started that went on my first ... TV shows slash investigation and ah I realized that were a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and were curious I get them all I did it and eventually I began doing it full time\nAnd you love it I Do\nGet they still not sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you've got a degree in environmental science yeah you're on\nThe moon program as well who are\nInterested in in in ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer that you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side that you believe this\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that everything icy\nAnd and it's you know always skeptical bite my science spring I guess you call it a priority and brain always you know makes me what's going on and I've had it was a unique experience is but uh [noise] is it enough there that I Know that the experiences that but\nAh they really paranormal already you know something else mentioned Asian or something I just can't explain\nWhat keep striving you why do you keep doing this\nOh there's a lot of reasons the the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand all aspects of the power level just like going in as a you know\nWell to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that so mediums shallow things like a gypsies at the beach do fortune telling and uh when I met Bahrain I was pretty much the same category but I figured it couldn't\n[noise] uh when I met more rain that was pretty much in the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do and uh so that's kinda my whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open minded enough to\nAt least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as I can about it to do that so that's\nKinda how I Am more open minded but still it got that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nA marine is is very unique and and you know there are a lot of mediums out there and\nBut uh woodworking with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff in in a trance channels like horses stills skills the crap out of most people who see it so uh yeah I you know like definitely she believes she has some type ...\nDo you run across a lot of people like her in what you do\nYou know you spent ... medium\nLots of mediums\nYeah I mean and we you know I also do a lot of studies for instance the physical medium ship is it something that's always fascinated me in and of course not for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental mania ship or a disparate speaks supposedly speaks through the\n... of them like ... ... Whoopi Goldberg in the movie ghost\nThat well that's a chance to meet him in and but uh that's still the disparate works through a medium versus a physical medium ship which the spirit comes into our around and actually moved stuff's for ...\nI like the Patrick Swayze and that same movie where they moved the coins that\nThose pennies movies and stuff right\nSo I I've been conducting a red light say answers or for the last four years to understand physical mania to see is what how much how valid isn't what type of experiences and see if I can explain some of those experiences\nYeah by ...\nImagine the media with no conservatives a world that's what we have a foreign rush rush Limbaugh delivered on WTO you\nCould be the strongest storm ever on Florida's panhandle ...

move\n'em I Need my round and when I got back another piece of ...\nAnd there wasn't anybody there that was playing around with you\nThere yeah the lobby was completely up\nAnd it happened like four times [laughter]\nNot where they're making good chess moves\nAre really the game had just started I wouldn't know\n[laughter] oh I'm going to go\nI actually got I felt I was like I'm\nI'm finished [laughter] ... you know this is a little like a\n... of course Ron have you seen objects move when you've been on the case\nDo absolutely it of course I just told you earlier about the book that flew off the shelf yeah but it's\nStill oddly he says that there's a famous case of a a Boston sports writer who was friends with\nA rush ... who was the angel French angel or something like that and uh used to play chess with all the time and eventually this this wrestling died in here they are a death best mate or or or a buster was his head\nAnd he bought one of those like trying to ... which is so he's he like just continue playing but then he realized one day the ... thing was never a plug did\nUh he actually called it a couple of people from the the the University of ... in Boston and they couldn't explain that they moved to the bus and everything and ah we continue to make these moves even though it wasn't\nA plugged in and he swears that he believes that was his friend the fringe angel still playing chess with them in the afterlife how many of these\nYou see a fringe angel still playing chess with them in the afterlife\nHow many of these events in a entities are mischief makers as opposed to trying to hurt somebody\n[noise] I think it's it's overblown as far as trying to hurt somebody um I mean marine in line so for God and I'm On an extra systems with the Catholic Church or talking demons versus a um you know ...\nYou know that there are some\nSpirit so that there are nasty and or\nTo be quite honest with you or having a trance channeling channel is sometimes like Maureen can be a little a nerve wracking because uh there was some versus actually don't like me and when you give them a body they for you know they they use it sometimes she's\nDrawn to rush out and run [noise] she's throwing me across the room before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so we have the air it can be nasty but I I think the the most of them are really not\n... not you've written about Ron having your back what does that mean exactly\nYeah you know one have made that we've worked together for so many years on and then the beginning you know if I started to transfer channel you know he would try to call me back meeting weight you know whether you're weightless coming out for him I mean what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that written on on where I Would talk to Iran and say you know in my mind I Know what I might appear to be out of control in my mind and actually\nYou know talking to the spirit or trying to you know ... to\nConnect more or get into more of what they're wanting and what's going on so now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out or to help me in a situation that's not safe and he's right there so that's having my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't\nKind of touched me and go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to do\nLet's go to urban and a state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing do\nLove your show 'em all along because as a I live in a house gets you a hundred and five years old\nAnd my age I I've had so many haunted experiences that house it's crazy it's actually kind of funny rarely 'cause I I uh really only have a nice white hope the guy's activity when I I'm trying to fix the house\nIf I like Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I've been doing some\nYou'll get the majority in the house and I come home and uh uh there was a company or about three feet away from my style that have been ripped off in your every move back laptops though it was like if you're not part of their\n... or when I go I go into my bedroom and it would take him to one of my TV strays and you know the what kind of set up in front of the house yeah it does make them that set it up on my bed\nAnd ah I think I Want my wife and my kids have actually seen a kid and a a wage uh I I actually had never seen those but I ...\nI've heard like the footsteps iceberg slamming doors\nSo you're pretty convinced that are they're\nAll there is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh\nI guess my question is is why why it went up to do something to fix the house is that when they seem to be\nWildly they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nYou are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best I mean it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually stretch things up\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do summer fun summer having a good time other evil what decides whether they're good or bad Ron in terms of that\nI think it's it's who you are with this this life and if you don't change you're pretty much who you are and the next life so if you have to\nDeal with the court accordingly of there are some times\nWhen I um don't speak vice lead to of as as some people who like in ... but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if they're ah that'd be any annoying or being a\nOffensive to to those who are in this realm now it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respect to\nGo to Bonnie in Los Angeles load Giovanni\nA out on your well thanks I'm and I'm Glad to be back last you got the pie coughing again truth thing\nA wrong green he's safe out there be careful with with uh with all the stuff that you guys are you know you guys were born with a I Know it can be really dangerous and wanted to share a little story of mine is really quick [noise] ah I ... truck driving right now but I I still do security from time to time\nOne of the places right security with our cat was a um a building called the malls that building and here in downtown LA\nIt's pretty old building it's one of those buildings kind of stood the test of time you architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's you know definitely haunted I Know I I Am one night especially I was I was working we have these monitors that have cameras set up off the route every lower building and there's several floors doesn't before\nAnd the monitors are set up you'd be motion sensor that so that every time somebody comes in route if the cleaning lady or something like that the monitors what John and I\nHave you ever caught one on tape\nYou know what I mean shadows I'm totally seen shatters I've seen and they'd always happen to have the corner of\nYour eyes this quick ... yeah\nThey do just like that but that would be great if you could get that caught on video\nReally long not close to your radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen to my heart radio to the ... armored radio ... more good hard radio dot com [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe are back what's wrong to collect Jim Maureen would our final segment here final ... more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere Amazon are all the major bookstores so\nI was only a marine that our dear friend Jeff ... wrote you're a forward to the ...\nOh yeah definitely I or go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went into goes type thing I went on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the ... village so that's a since then we've become really good friends\nUse technology continue to make ghost haunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better quicker than it does a lot of\nThings out there some of them are really drunk science but the\n... yeah I don't know I mean spirited but Ralph for you know hundreds and hundreds of years and ah they didn't have a water technical stuff back then yet people still hate experiences though had great experiences and seeing them and everything else I don't know we need to\nYou know it reminds me of a you know all the physical ship stuff the Wi Fi boards and those were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people wanted to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic\nDevices that doing they're they're trying to get the ghost tentative deal directly with spirit and not have to go through the media and not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but\nIf yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm\nBetter pieces equipment up there and there are some that are out of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good uh I I Can't remember a a good record\nAnd Maureen how 'bout you will technology you change things\nUm you know I honestly don't think that technology has reached a point that makes it more sensitive than human being you know then what we can sense ourselves I mean we may be getting close with some areas that they're you know they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime Sharon [laughter] I don't I don't think so All right\nLet's go to a final calls here and we'll just go to\nHastings, Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a\nSafe haven there were ... hurricane headed your way\nWe're on the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on the front\nOkay let's pray that everybody else's go ahead bill\nYeah it goes story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida we were at a a paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in Plano against state which is known to be on it and why we were there ghost\nThis in the middle of the night that goes to actually made it table moves likely up on the second floor\nSo he went up\nTo the second floor and we were able to communicate with the ghost wife Susan and I and some other people that were there and we [noise] we any um any man flashlight on a table and the ghost good answer our questions by making the light wink\nAnd a half get various questions and to get it to indicate that it was only and then it was a was a ... been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period jeez\nYou know I think [noise] end up at the time my auntie um I had a brief case with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so that time would hear clicking noises that goes for teasing me that he was opening brief case\nI Love it now while I'm On for the oil would happen is if you drop like a little\nI don't care of a chair or something um they last about a mountain last July but the one before that in the middle of the night well having a little tiny bottle campers coming off the chair and it's fun and\nLike I was kind of being poor\nWhy are they mischief makers Ron ... what are they trying to accomplish my plane around like a\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to\nLet you know there there have pay attention to me so I I think that's\nThat's primary it but uh I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I elected to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey I take it back she says we were reading the or the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shattering books in which is a rather interesting\nThing to do anything really what they want to do I believe\n... each time what do you have a this one from Sarah in Rochester\nBut I Believe next in tweets Tom what do you have\nA this one in from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to run or and Maureen can recommend ways to prevent ... from coming to a person's life ... into someone's life let's give that to you Maureen\nOkay so I don't even leave it to the wrong one [laughter]\nWe'll get on main really will get\nYou out if I'm honestly I'm a big believer with the with the St Michael so I Know for me there's some good things one is intention if you\nYou know if you're looking for that and you're believing that eagles coming into your life and you know it's very possible that your credit invited in on the other thing is I ... I have a granddaughter who is\nYou know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up the actually she thinks spirits are ready um so what we're doing is we have a St Michael's prayer card that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have different varying crystals around the room\nTo how much energy on and he's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's a belief right so I Believe that works on its intention networks I think if you believe in yourself as well on you can tend to have bought out bought out most times what'd\nYou say you were on what about it\nWell I agree with that away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurricane and your intentions sure\nMake it yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion the costs and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two don't do well and you know in you know who's the sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what it word works\nYep trying to re a hundred percent with the judge sneak\nIn any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead\nAnd hang on to say first that are on I think we should all get centered in our heart and then ten to dissolve\nThe circuit yeah I agree [noise] ... ah question is probably more ring\nI have\nBeen serving the land for the last six years here I feel is time\nFor me to go back to serving man of attempted to move in April when I had a series of events that showed me there was a time yet so my question is would it be time for me now to to live on [noise]\nDid you do a quick little reading here Maureen sure any one moment okay\nWell you probably know into a chat with you Ron on this what's what are your next project Ron How often do you get called to investigate\nWell we had quite a few uh you know I Would say you like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now and uh we only choose the ones we really want to do basically uh uh\nYou get flooded with requests for what\nWe do get a lot of them to be honest with you judge so uh yeah it ... you've got to screen them somehow so which is difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\n[noise] All right so they'll actually called the ... couple of cards and one was aspiration saying you know\n... to go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual card that says you know you need to be empowered to this um and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment as right\nTo actually make a change and it seems like he's been working behind me off I have tried the night I'm working really hard and it's kinda kinda read some of those benefits and actually to move for when I'm obviously I Can't tell you what to do but\nI think that if you were to make a change now would be good looking at the time\nI really appreciate that\nOkay good luck bill over everything works out next up we're going to Jaycee not that one in California Welcome to the show hygiene you see\nAll right how you doing at George ... but his first time but I'm a dedicated listen been listening to the show but almost about Fifteen Years pre shoot that and I'm a hard go out to all the people in uh Florida due to fact I'm really from\nUh North Carolina and I understand what they are doing like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "10"}
