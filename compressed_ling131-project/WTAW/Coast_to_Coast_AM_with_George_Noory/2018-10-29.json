get into some real weird ones and ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures yeah maybe ... that were reported long ago are now being reported ETs or aliens and it's\nMaybe the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you can do on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John Cale is would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least I mean I you know different people get difference\nYou know responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of type the view that is most important\nUm [noise] revelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be\nMulti connected if you like to connect said and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot side creatures on in the same location and timeframe or say for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties\nUm when they were ... when they come off from a sane soaring around the the skies above both point pleasant he also had a lot of cancers with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures that like some of the the we're the ones like ... and the dog men and things like that I think\nI'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology all courageous aching because I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we daily with something that's based saved as an animal\nThat night may not be and I think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads they just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle in vale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got wolf men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery but the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um\nI've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shape shift the like in American we have all the London or anything like that um but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive one off\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that they the locations where they talk men type pages said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial ... I'm Native American land um some of the ... the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to shut and locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one a werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYou know they show us I'm at a British a bicycle royal Airforce hell to break and there actually was able to speak to the witness passionately this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but working a Elvis Asia or you can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presence fishes hiked the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ... and would have sort of kind of look like a big foot taught trade show was it not for five\nThat just face to face was very different to how you're\nDescribing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine took a big party with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise] you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know\nCreate a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because it never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right down to ... when you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats\nAnd the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the zoo or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog when\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not well in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now\nI'm tone of accounting door who wrote a Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the ... he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically I'm much luck a much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dogs eat what are the main that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nUm and the and light that dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying to find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the ... not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller um formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where\nWitnesses so one of these large black ducks fan and like they\nOkay she's going back centuries\nThe dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and next second you know just\nVanished into nothing um and again it's hard to determine\nWhat based things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the spirits of dogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there\nAnd well now you write in fact they become known as a base face I Am big cats\nAnd again every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask I\nAsk I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the a K\nWhich simply defy\nExplanation because\nThe share number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a payoff flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature that this could\nBe the rock and roll theme song for Halloween ACDC hell's bells we're right back\nDo for you to watch a TV show beyond belief with George ... simply go do beyond belief dot com [noise]\n\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have known about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog man and a to find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven it's served as an ... wages in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story you know I guess appropriate for um Halloween and there's a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with well I can only call like a man in black\nAnd not many black has that been\nPortrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies but the rail many black much weight and that sort of very ... and eight and don't and look entirely human they sort of almost look ... found\nPile like and there are a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know whereas in the movies ... sacred agents of the sacred agency but Terry telling me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd this creeping manning black\nTime towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm\nBasically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of folk half did that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it all ... states and I think\nYou know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset will things said I'm gonna come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years\nDifferent forms the different people different times but it's a harbinger of doomed commented predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think you you know plays out in the men's I wasn't and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six point pleasant West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of we had a UFO activity um they're surfacing of these weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how many black and also a lot of of the amyloid they unconscious and also reports\nOf women and black turning up and threatening a UFO witnesses out of the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called the ... he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River an Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the law firm on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have there was really sort of two overriding ferries one but not mine\nEither caused the disaster but that's all that it was sort of a a warning on to say that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and an ... look\nI'm that's still very much ... if I took upon you know to this day but um it was also an English equivalent of eight known as the ... which also has a sort of

that every time he started to get back into the race a chicken investigating the al ... stories\nAbout things that happened to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized\nFrom his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into any quite literally ... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting his claws maintain\nA resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking\nAnd I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking on the part of people who follow this sort of stop and wish it would happen or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves that activity in relation to other\nCreatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there were certain spots and outbreaks of big activity um\nSome of these like monster stories you know the the ... and then suddenly there's you know a two week period\nWe get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like you see sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they have that perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that wave of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interesting now from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about it\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to the mosque in Chicago that suddenly afterwards had lots of almost ... perfect he dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um

but it takes government surveillance two older level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the\nThe conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional um aspect of the story

um alien woman\nAnd I'm I'm for all kinds of path and said he was taken on board against these will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia ... is all you know it was a really\nWeird aspect of the phenomena and now there's this little uh known aspect to the story or which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio\nBaylor spouses a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ... um he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel way it is if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um it had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast and he was making the Beijing noise now that's\nKind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shy\nThey the spinning disk on top of the roses and debating noise says like the classics and you get with a helicopter now mine came forward um\nIn the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies and um he told a race a year for research rich rentals of what he said was the real story namely that um\nThe the abduction was a fabrication and that's going that he really did evolve alley call to but they talk and said I'm ... working in the field lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of aerosol illusion to Jenny average so er which incapacitated in Tokyo on board the helicopter or on the the a woman was really there and the power was played out\nAnd they a woman was really there and the power was played out um but he would say that sort of at all to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite story was but they\nAgencies within governments that might well a pain rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad management the fifties logged say eyes and ... and things like base the plan was to try and determine to what extent\nBase human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince papal back in the CIA leans we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just ban sat back and white hate to say how much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story abate embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets I think that it's it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they should where it gets confusing if the you know throughout January and I didn't have adoption as\nA venue have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO and go as the ... to try and\nYou know um to see how it works on paper doesn't show you know it gets really confusing when the cookie rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both and just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's a it's actually both because it's so many abduct taste that I spoke with said that they are a number of occasions I'd actually paying ... by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my face situation it was more but these\nMilitary personnel were actually approached should be up to pace quietly requesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't have some of them have basically they ... it was a safe the military were asking\nQuestions um along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words they were\nTrying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um\n... they have to pay a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast Greg bishop I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay to correspondence in the Nineteen\nNineties a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures that I wrote to each other\nBack and forth were opened and sailed back down with type and I'm now they can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like the ... I was taught open race failed it was almost as if\nWhoever was doing base wants to Greg and college and I know that someone was opening their mail in other words it was sort of luck and intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him\nI'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know that there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers show Shiite them with capital ... nations\nI'll tell you what they were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions that we got some other ground to cover before then or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I think he's Seventy one\nDoing the ... stage with thousands of members ... ... ... ... ... ... [noise]\nUm they just seem to be tied to both capital mutations and um the Eileen abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things it's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates\nOutside of government you know it may actually it may sort of do research and work for the governments\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly helicopters I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nAnd most people in government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it may have been even sort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more\nDifficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the fate of information request so in that sense I think\nYou know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and other ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously near the homes of alien abduction ... and and again kind of light with college or in Greg\nThis might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em\nAnd be able to to respond at high speed if in in the event that they have that the papal climatic helps his were actually able to\nCatch an abduction going ahead you know in the ... I was actually the very time\nSomebody used the tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government should wait on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't any one really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nTape the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we'd ailing wave as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more\nDifficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... native and know than\nUm border of the United states and in the ... to Seventy five and I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so I think we're seeing a pot and\nAnd and I think some violence\nAnd intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause that you know I'm\nExplain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out it's so to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this you mentioned you bring up bombs are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are new to you the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the German because I was going to come out in December and then there's a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case with your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know was our story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you are right but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out a few um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on um you know they are and I think the big difference we'd lives are is he never\nEmbroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it he tells the same ... years ago he hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't\nYou know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another they the the grace of the aisle and grays new to the abductions\nThat somehow they have this deep and sort of sinister and disturbing interest in the human soul\n'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this week's portion of very fifty one he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that would be the aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell\nAnd one of the things I talk about in the book is\nAn a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed dastardly by these\nMilitary agencies are private corporations I'm Still asked questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a fuel cell leaving your body um did you have any sort of\nLike a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave this story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to you a topic and\nYou know you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic um in light of the kind of a while that you bring up in this book where there are surveillance and there's\nCounter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know they ... they ... rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence\nThe government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um\nYou know ... ... a rainy sort of a difficult\nArea which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know when I've the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why why they'd be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then\nAt the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there is but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um survivor and solve abductees\nYeah it's it's right now the X. files everything is great nothing black and white I'm ... we'll take one or two calls like east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia Hi John you're on with Nick rubber\n... thanks for taking my call a I have a story that might be one of the earliest alien and counters um it was so to me and my

find that it works um [noise] they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of an audience of her string\nTheory but sure I'm using so yes string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to make\nMake simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government in the universe their string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem and it really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together you know we have\nWe we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor some atomic world but the or the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and it's on 'em and these are on science\nA theory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions and they're using them in order to come up with a single\nSet of mathematical equations that would be encompassing\nAnd that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the Weinstein union version and wondering version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which of scientists have struggled to explain and tangled in theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean\nYou know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having to set that equation that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange an uncanny on implications of\nOf quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well\nRight and the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who\nWho have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and says X\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it wasn't a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah ... is a great little book I'm\nSo I'm kind of a classic science fiction or math fiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land\nAs a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of mentioned we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott he was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a\nIn an era of science and wrestling with what it meant the religious and scientific at the same time um you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine with Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but habits flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist\nTakes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and it's populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects which is linked with like some of them were flat where some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even line they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world and of course they believe that\nUh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object of fear inserts itself goes down in in in certain fell into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his ... sees the appearance of this mysterious object you first talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the first says this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere regards to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and ... down on his flat world that can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them so that's where it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension he goes back\nTo flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately and flatland it's forbidden it's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of your ears and and the story ends\nWith this for a flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that by his readers ... from the readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye because of their reality so he sort of like\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox\nBut up at the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where he saw that there was that there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm so happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ... it gets pretty complicated [laughter]\nUm [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions ah the doors\nRight on through take us into the brick\nDefined were George ... speaking ... dot com website scroll down to the bottom and click Georgia's humans are\n\n\nWould change their treasures\n\n\n\n\nFalls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make All right and the situation as he he raped her map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nKind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that the way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed as I say in the book you develop\nA story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed as I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables and my question you know these higher and higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points up to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops over way of what he thought of as sort of re educating the senses\nIn order to catch glimpses into this into the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled\nA all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know that three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll ah and then he'll rotate the Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative um exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond\nThan the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um\nAnd doing your research but instead he he was doing things like\nPutting this this ah this cue these cube SATs together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten which is one of the first\nUm I'm an automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these\nYou know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document in trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you got a yeah the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it you know they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife for heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know their writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another\nPerson in the book chapter seven chapter ages is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis the ...\nThe ... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions to rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nIncorporates them in a number of sermons a man and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got\nHe's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings up any or it out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um which is a chapter really about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm\nKind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how he held this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else on higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um\nYour dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation bucks and we have people like the ... with a psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah uh people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also was soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that does that surprise him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predicted dreams or what what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin you know as he's camped out\nUh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wandered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but you would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happens you would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his books\nAnd see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island recognizes the island as as an someplace he's already been in his dreams\nHe noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French but he's panic he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows who's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believed him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nNot a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island that Martin ... the French speaking island Martinique 'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um\nAnd some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think I mean how could this be how could how could in in my dream how could I have seen an event\nThat hasn't happened man he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google M. J. W done and\nYou can Google him and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as those countries had towards World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he is puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down\nAnd then he he he comes across basically of the like people like in ten and people who are talking about the possibility that there's higher dimensions and he's reading Einstein well he's reading about Einstein's theory and sort of popular science and he he

D. priest leaves on national Christopher here if you've ever read the pre sleaze or sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with\nA with a lot of young books as the head of the wonderful book at the great bucks\nYeah yeah oh oh oh good do you have read it well very good well at the same thing you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues that have been happening is that as with the I guess with the ... particularly you seem to still be attached it gets on the anthropology of says it never really\n... van and they're the they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their priest says there's this life I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue is a time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality\nAnd then I also the whole perception or not just the time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we we see that everything is\nEverything is is a sort of waves and I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but the time becomes very essential 'cause it gets the existence of matter that you do an art project or our perception of it anyway so I mean they're just\n... anyway you have any comments were thoughts about yeah\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come JV Priestley I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions and he read him than who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about 'em and he'd comes up and did all his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and\nA young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time a feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time um and in the book he has\nAll kinds of testimonials from people who have written about their pre cognitive dreams either dreams that\nSeem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty\nThree can't remember and he he asked\nThe the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience as they've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience but what many of the letters are still extent this still at the\nUniversity of Bradford I'd been there to read through all the letters and I I incorporate a number of time in my book\nEspecially will be a Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds and crisp white and Tom Petty takes us into the break we'll get some more of your calls and questions in a moment\nDuring the ... the sports page with thousands of members it's great to show up they didn't do anything with other means ... ... ... am including like but [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nA crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use in order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you were talking about\nWhat Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggestion\nDollar [laughter] reading\nFrom thinks the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal [noise]\nAnd I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was dead was going to give me his car and all that money [noise] so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that I Dreamed I wrote it down with them with a date and and everything and it came true like months later\n[laughter] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and and think about your dreams and\nHe believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these\nGlimpses um glimpses into the future and their dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard mind Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I thought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote few in remote viewing has it's drawbacks to this is um this is a mental world this is a mental travel or sold travel\nBut it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons weather's healing whether it's neat a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things out there doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing ... is not like you're writing automatic because not automatic writing it's really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all that does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it'll start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a\nAs a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young ... and many others um you know when we talk about there'll be in three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or the mentioned where would that be some people say well it's like it's going in and you know it's going not going out and we're going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um\nAnd yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to access those those mentioned um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into the zone where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's much more are much more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um\nAnd and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks joke for the call you know you read about a musician and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCartney has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his hand yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs are already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and you talked to scientists about scientific creativity unscientific convention and many scientists will have the same kind of stories\nSome of them will talk about during some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with Chris white\nNo George ... uh I don't think I've ever called in the year so I I usually call in the north north southern Dr Critz why thank you for taking my call but before I ask a question I wanted to just\nReference ... Salem is found in Hebrew chapter seven which makes reference to the queen of failing and they don't have a chance was fourteen and so I'm going to end up for reference for the listeners and ... and you didn't call it now um I I Want to\nWell the listener Kate and thinking that you didn't want it now um I I Want to plan on getting your opinion on not not feeling in my theory that ... that goes and ... are usually\nThe same button from place to be different in for reference I'm a Christian they hold the Irani Eighteen prohibition against us on collecting the spirit world but not contact us\nAnd I had a theory that in most cases um and and back I Want to ask your opinion whether\nThe up and you saw the video up there on on a post last night I think that they need to use the magnet to make a that pops up a pencils and pens jump around but I also think it's possible that there are genuine deem angels\nOr parents which may may actual I don't think it's likely later the spirit\nOf kidney or maybe extra tropical eating from another dimension and somehow hold in most cases they deem are masquerading as you I thought it was Eighteen but in some cases maybe Eighteen so I'm a stay on the line in case you want to ask me a question or something because this is pretty deep\nWell that's a lot on their Gordon let's let's get their take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there um\nThere is a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the\nUh all of the science fiction literature and um and even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these being\nCame from another dimension I'm so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of that in American Pop culture about um other dimensional or other dimensional being um you also raise the question of you\nKnow what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional rational beings to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise I'm I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that\nFrom just some of my reading and and not literature\nAnd you know I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know what we strive birth your stuff on on on communion or yes she has a new book I'm\nI'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and go on the other so he I think Whitley is come to come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you you've come to believe that as well if there is a\nThat the the connection somehow you know maybe departed spirit um our aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nI Know we we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program or Chris Rock and looking for his actions\nAnd you'd be amazed how many scientists or a behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection yeah looking at the idea of universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in in your book of course um\nThat he wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and you know I um I Believe now that that's a\nThat's a very mainstream I'm sort of conventional wisdom now among cosmologist and theoretical physicists that that there is a multi birth you know which is um and that that's another fantastic scientific concept that there's not proof for\nThere's really not proof of that idea but it it is it has become a kind of appealing idea to scientists\nAnd then you mentioned the sort of many infinite parallel universes of many worlds theory or the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics or another idea that we live in a complex and constantly branching\nUniverse where there's multiple copies infinite copies of all of us doing all kinds of other things right\nAnd in parallel worlds so I I Do try to introduce some of those other theories on towards the end of the book as well but it's it's an extremely complicated [laughter] you know it's an extremely yeah it's subject to try to talk about all the different possible other world scenarios", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "29"}
