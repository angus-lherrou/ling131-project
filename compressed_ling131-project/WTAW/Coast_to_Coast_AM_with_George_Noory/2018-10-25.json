you were considered to be a good which aren't you\n[laughter] well I I Know [laughter]\nAs opposed to a ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people who know how to dissolve start for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with Sean and and she's also happens to be of I I consider to be a very powerful which end and she gave me cannot jak and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um\nAnd like I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing that work for me\nShe empowered me and taught me how to do it myself so I guess you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest of history\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with this now that I've\nYou're confident with with what I Do you know with the spouse that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more\nAbout healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing have you ever\n... but one she'll but he\nNever and I want to make it very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\n... what what what good are shows that if you can't win anything\nYou know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in my mind is more powerful\nThan I realized so I think that when we\nStart healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up a money spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the\nUm healing and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something oh sure\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply\nChanting uh spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say resigned really that long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy intense second chance just or get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I

keep out the entities in any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by and I will say on\nNegative beans leave the house never to return I cast you out I cast you out I cast you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle\nAnd every single corner of my home and it really really works and then I'll ward all the windows you know the the feelings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun\nIt's really really fun and then when I when I chat spells like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and you do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we have I mean we have given our power away to not only our friends and family but to the government and it\nYou know we were just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we we feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the

I have a story to Maya demons later [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real live demon\nMen this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way what's on the medal I said I said is ... is a religion and um they need to\nBe good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset or some sort of you yes on ... it's a religion or check and so they work with magic and they work with the Audi shots which are different spirit and so this\nSon battle had sent a intentionally of course sent a demon my way and this was after I had had her reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the colds or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life and\nI that same evening that same day in in the evening\nI um [noise] as soon as I turned off my life so I Can't even blame it on a train as soon as they turned off my light [noise] um I was pinned down to my bed [noise] and I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I

I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I I made that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just\nPeeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I dress swarmed up like when I went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman was like what happened but yeah it's so freaky and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man some and that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep\nWithout the light off for about three months after that\nIt totally terrified me who\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that in turn out\nWell you know I'm not going to let's say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail or drunk or shine\nYeah we're we're going to the ... or the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany either way you ever to laugh you don't have a ... which uh which should have a tackle you don't have\nA which is actually a wise woman so that the definition of a wage but yeah I think you [noise] um\nThat kind of wanted a ...\n[laughter] and do it and even if I\nTried and so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand I'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them on some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people\nAnd um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but I have proof from ... who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this and it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma\nSo they can be you know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the\nDanger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime and the demon the pet is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I'd ever heard of a demon die unless you like ... you\nCash them out but they don't buy\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what is going to happen when we reincarnate and the demon is going to probably harassed them and let them know that\nOne one theory and I can say I'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days has a lot of cases\nOf of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey\nInto their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big powerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's different for each of them but for the most part\nThey were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement\nDoing and so she does is she\nJust breaks that agreement that they can finally be free and um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know\nThese demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... ... what are they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and\nI'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from\nAnd they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and they looked into us however they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so\nThis is why it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and he'll or our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases of a demon intrusions\nAnd people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California to get us started like yeah

take to get some place how ... person on almost kind of stuff and she the universe crowded\nOr you know it takes a while to get here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next stars [laughter] what we've learned a an awful lot\nAbout how ... ... what's going on in terms of energy creation it's not just stores we know how the storage work we used to and and the Hundred Years'

one so far we get to your calls as well stance with us for about twenty ... more minutes or so\nStand you wrote a book with Kathleen Martin was the niece of Benny Hill called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause it wouldn't look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story of Barney and Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age how would you categorized that case the Barney and video case\nWell I I think it's a very important case and for several different reasons I'm\nOn the people are are not talking about people who don't have a reputation we're not talking about people who are trying to seek attention to her attention sake but he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney aims black shoes why that was very unusual in the early sixties it took guts for them to come out that's right\nAnd they were very concerned about what the reaction would be a ... this was in the early sixties and you know it got a ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard\nOf what's going on ... you got to have people who can handle the heat's speak\nIt's unfortunate that Barney didn't live terribly Long Island in Nineteen sixty eight I guess and I'm\nI'm Betty I'm Around a long time for which I Am glad and ah it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with him\nAbout sensational live I mean let's face it stand back and say better than Barney where specimens for something [laughter] yeah\nAnd they weren't treated but they certainly weren't going off and glory and claiming all kinds of ... things as being part of their interaction with the aliens uh and\nYou know [noise] I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on [noise]\nOn my ... and I I was very impressed uh and I was impressed by something else or the media in that case I mean hey and Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh\nUh you know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing ... into town and told they were they were staying and which is very unusual yeah like contact with them we had dinner together\nOr just all three of us and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and\nI had known what to expect because I hadn't bell and stuff like this I mean if there was a little bit crazy story aliens grabbing a couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you\nWell yeah I mean you know you'd have done it pretty early on was early yeah\nIn the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right\nNo till I was very fortunate\nTo have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the conference too so I didn't get too many meetings with Barney because he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that a very he's gone on that and of course I work very closely with that is nice\nKathleen Martin we've done three books together mhm and ah\nThat's been a pleasure to a if not often you find it can write with people uh have co written books will will with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYou you you too clicked in she's great in the field and you follow due to a ... she's super oppression\nYou don't jam ... when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed them over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in a you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I said so what do you think Dr a ball they're telling you the truth or not what do you think in he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them ... under hypnosis separately told the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying\nWhat happened when I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\n... ... we have to remember the the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war but\nYes called the ...\nWere way before anybody would get the balls and stuff like that\nYeah and he had learned to use ... as a means of bringing guys who've had terrible experiences you know your buddy said blown off next year battle [noise]\nAh that's traumatic but weeds and so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands and you know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole ...\nBut he sure we thought that these people are not in line that's right they're\nNot looking for attention cetera et cetera I was impressed with him and uh\nI was in prison in Bahrain two and a warning to ideal ... and uh uh unfortunately but they they they were\nThey had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early ... was not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak to resist the reporter with the story out\nMuch to their surprise I'm relieved ... were treated fine uh and they found out around the world and\nThat's the thing that I have a look I lecture to Nineteen countries it's given me a pretty good handle on one of the people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know listeners from someplace else\nAnd I found I just haven't had bad reactions you\nKnow and if anything it's getting even stronger I think let's take some calls for instance let's go to line drawn in Virginia Beach east of the Rockies go ahead John you're on which dancing Friedman\nStan and get a job as a state in the the\nUm you know a weird past couple of years or several he is really we've been sending radio signals Dallas space and I'm at we be said that we point out any time that you know of and with all the photos that\nAnd and the report it seems to me that the one I'm would have picked up at ... and ... some kind of a plot\nOr the you either one of you know anything\nWhen we were we picked up the wild signal stand firm setting search for extraterrestrial intelligence they really don't know what it is ...
