ability good goals such as spirit guide and as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks storage for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual and the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about\nAll things supernatural a good and evil are also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition tradition of that but\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be dinner this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spiritual will get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense\nUptight and yeah you know kind of ... about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demonic spirit\nAnd also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those who are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people\nThat have power\nAnd and changed the world or good or for ill and uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful here it it could be said that the counterpart of angels that powerful or not\nPart of angels that powerful they are not regular\nPeople who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not to have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm\nFrom the non physical route\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are are much better\nEquipped to uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trends\nFor information into our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other other people at ourselves to get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there is such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack are\nSo many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate color ethically it's kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness and they communicate on that level and they whisper\nTo us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sore negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an extra ... when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's what they could they could come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work twenty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times\nFor short to rations and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I Can't ... I was\nBorn with the ability to seize spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with a school work and some are looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they actually come\nStarted walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're going to come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the\n... the new version of the ... am apples no available for I'm bone in now androids ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nI Love it [noise] Bush\nPut the need to be found beauty setting I have a nine inch from UT ... began your favorite kind of ... million dollar Omar beauty and frankly I Can't and you get a free makeup that tree out and then I think I never mind the you can apply to brag cancer research foundation by making an insect any sense\nSpouse mental things mean everything sounds his ... family actually apply\nModified pull it won't try to come and watch them so I had I lodged top condition he's also the biggest killer decided to stop pecking kinda Bora it's just incredible feeling said I've never felt ... around my hot when I have the extra category two and a half months later\nSomething amazing happened which will be will taste more on my hot actually contract it's staggering about this one is staging a chick Rick ... to ...

we'll take calls next to our as well before we get into open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energies they generate hatred\nAnd they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today in order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do it don't want us to know that there were there\nThey want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nThey communicate with us ... either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family\nDestroy their lives\nAnd also ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want to sell\nThey sure do ...\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWho will do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can influence\nThis by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling so it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things\nThat we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that and so when we're angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they don't know that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some\nKind of life after death from something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens when we simply drop or physical bodies would become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and it just to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die that was an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating in thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nMake its spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely our own\nAre they under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nAlways completely are wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not\nSure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule or they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families getting them to fight\nUh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs an incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light will come out on attack I pull out my nonsensical stored they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react\nTo they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem\nThey would essentially kill a child in the cradle it no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible and they have they just hate humans\nAnd so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and in our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other because we're being used and it's not just\nYou know I heard some talk on the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think all that's true\nBut also we're being attacked by non physical entities that wish to see the human race fail it was a possibility that that could happen it's a very serious issue we have the ability\nWhen we get a chance to to Rush Limbaugh what we think we say thanks big guy Rush Limbaugh we do live with a W\nFree at last July ...

I also think that ah the argument over creationist or theories and a\nTrue scientific physical theories is ridiculous they pull work hand in hand first principle is creation spirits don't just sit around and clogging do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angel God you know they create almost like a pattern of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical filled the non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so especially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nPhysical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle\nPersonality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially swipe believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to refer another question go ahead Jerry\nAh yeah what I was gonna say is your pocket

Rome are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings\nLight beings ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies and face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status and then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the ... and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path\nChances are you are not\nProbing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes and you realize that the scenes themselves were utilizing\nAncient texts and teachings that they had developed and synthesize from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the address that were centered on how do we contact the watchers one and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the\nDead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years\nBefore the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings to congregate with the angels the holy ones the angel of the lord\nThe watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the at a mile or G. of ... the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact\nThe term fallen angel is means that they are evil beings or that they are being who were\nAre somehow demonic they their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will heavenly realms and hook human body that is their great sin they crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed\n... what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out God's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they descended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others simply decided that they were\nDemonic being that they were a powers that were beyond human control and\nCertain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experienced the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's\nThe great crossing a line that the watchers transcended are crossed over and came to teach humans and how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rude on them to me it sounds like ... we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds is new field which is the word where we get the word into feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected various examples of today are Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus\nRiding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds and what we learned is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're light\nOddity it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota it's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel injure dimension only and throughout the cosmos\nArguing with William Henry whose latest work the watchers of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative Mitt all it just goes\nAfter these gone that the ... spiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their\nBodies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to these stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn\nInvisible and this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of eyes are covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches with the Tibetans describe as the\nRainbow body of light in the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light oddity that they describe that what they tell us that are the the\nOur body the frequency of our body can be accelerated\nUntil it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails and have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers and so these watchers could\nCould step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form\nAnd then face back into their non physical light being for well\nWhat did they want was er an agenda\nIn my view when you follow the ascension path of of the watchers that they were here they came here in on a on a rescue mission they are the ... by the way they were not here for gold that that is decorated

protection Jeffrey is also an expert on Huntington homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual\nAnd the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about\nAll things supernatural a good and evil are also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that but\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spiritual will get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirit ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nThis is a huge target for demonic spirit and also negative spirit and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd and changed the world or good or for ill\nUh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so there are around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful here it it could be said that the counterpart of angels there that powerful or not\nCounterpart of angels\nThere that powerful or not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd ah we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm\nFrom the non physical route\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trends for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other\nOther people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack a\nSo many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate ...\nKind of like a river that travels underneath\nOur consciousness\nThey communicate on that level and they whisper\nTo us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sore negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an extra ... when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's what they can they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times\nFor short rations and is very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you see I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits

these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human humans they\nWant nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred\nAnd they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today in order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there are there\nThey want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time\nWe just can't see them and they communicated with us ... either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family\nDestroy their lives\nAnd also try to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they\nWant to sell they sure do ... and we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying that it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nI've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that\nCan influence this by essentially getting into our energy field or emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not\nNormally do that ... and so when we're angry\nThat's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and it is to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make off of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die at an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nNaked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely wrong\nOr the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nCompletely out wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular\nSpirit in charge of all negative spirits I ... but my spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight\nOr getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what\nWould normally be a small amount of anger and to complete rage and they're very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs an incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out or an attack I pulled out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home\nAlso negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems\nAlso known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible\nThey have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and in our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other\nBecause we're being used\nAnd it's not just you know I heard some talk you know in the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think all that's true but also we're being attacked by non physical entities they wish to see the human race fail and it was a possibility that that could happen it's a

created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened after ... board followed me as it said it would and I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of family and so I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried Glenn thing my house with stage and everything else um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean\nAnd I'm I'm not getting any where do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nWell definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loosen up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense ... there's many substances that work very very well loosening up energy is kind of like spring something\nOn the wall to get something off of it doesn't alone get rid of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that stage will\nRelease it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think that's going on here to Jay Z you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nBreaking sense all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nIn to some extent but emotional energy negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kinda like you know taking really pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy for\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energies from the very first day that were born shortage and these things can become trapped in our bodies energy feels also known as the ... but the orders not just a bunch of pretty light\nIt is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems have an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is their spirit\nOr maybe three or four feet outside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy field and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home uh watching television\nOr you know a pub just every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy fields have we don't protect ourselves and most people don't\nThat it actually permeates into our energy field and mix it with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes habits and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just demonic spirit the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that\nFortunately energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let\nGo of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's gone right natural\nLet's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show ... go ahead\nYeah George or idea of what I'm a ... of the original language of the scripture and I'm actually writing a book called that we really go out and I tell you the Bible like the navy big I've dealt with a lot of the party\nA thing and I was going to ask\nYou Jeffrey are you a Christian I don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God\nI also think that ah the argument over creation is a theories and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous people work hand in hand\nFirst prince ... creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angel God\nYou know they create almost like a bad or of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical filled the non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle\nEnter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is being fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with it I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSwipe believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two ah theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to refer another question go ahead Jerry\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches ... and the guy go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nAh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off of God the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's the relationship between you and God now why is that well the arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord need dia de Jesus means humanity and cry needs and only did one okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person but we're all in the same boat no matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out of then ah our entire life we we are and have you been all that is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nThose demons seem to be every where we're going to come back and take funnel calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\n... the new version of the coast to coast

California's within say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey great work that you're doing Jeffrey my question is about war and the battle field in war zones how does\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica salt I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are methods throughout rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a place where negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirit says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up\nAnd strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural and a battle situation ah emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know\nUh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military you just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take the stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service\nTen minutes in the morning and ten minutes and the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us we need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect\nNegative emotional energy ah this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also ... off the fear\nHere so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what uh what I'm involved\nIn is not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientist or not call me up and to argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack and\nAlso negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy\nA person's life a hack the fabric of the family in the best way to do it is to pull out\nThe resources money George to get it out if they destroy your business and they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violent Lee and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have the failed business single most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in or business after business comes in\nAnd you have problems of failed dismisses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well plus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desk and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit because if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job was to be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub or a business\nThe story about walking into a living environment a pub or a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what sort of picking up on George is emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and the needs to be cleared out so they attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work\nNow they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids and\nA and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go the Monique in sun ... son ...
