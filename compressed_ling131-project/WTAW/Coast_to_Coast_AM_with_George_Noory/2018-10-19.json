like that\nI one of my cousins had drowned so there was like a built in fear of water and my mother and that the you know don't go in the water so I never really learned to swim\nSo\nWhen I was about

body\nBut I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my to teach me to swim for one thing that's probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experiences with my father's brother my uncle he was in the twins\nAnd we're walking in a lake and ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I get a whole in this lake in just like you don't I went to must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm gone I and I thought this is it I'm dead end job back something upon me\nBacked up by pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest family but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nTrucks I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah we were there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center with towering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know we've had to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they come down as you know and\nWe were\nWe had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when the safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that to my website where um what happened\nI I I actually had gone to sleep and that was awakened and told to go into the living room and to help people\nTo cross over if they were coming through had created a portal in my building and then my apartment and people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people think they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still out in that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida but uh just like so many incredible things have people would just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if it's just that\nYou know something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us but write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your you have to pay it to try to remember and to try to record with your experience thing and it will really happen that way it'll open up\nMore of that that consciousness and you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of money yeah sure absolutely\nOkay trucks thank you I had never heard of a thing whatever but uh I had an odd about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did astro travel which I had\nReally no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to a a Tibetan I'm Sorry to say the\nLlama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the babies born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob

that this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies\nSupposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman and it's finally combination on the earth and the Nineteen eighties so I was at his commentary and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back\nAnd as I was waking up he said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I check before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I've misspelled it slightly put an H on it where it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website

doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die like St your main also was walking and George to believe that that's possible you

course the psychic in your phone calls will will do some readings Joyce with everything that you do in your field what would you say has been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the medium ship part the psychic medium ship\nPart ... where people are killed\nWhen they receive messages and their loved ones and they realize that the people I'm not really just dead or a fixed or whatever they may be thinking cause really\nI loved church and\nReligious organizations but they don't do it with a big favor or they don't say that person is doing really well so I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over you shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy that healing and wellness with them so that that's really important so medium ship brings in that ability to let people know that their loved ones doing fine\nDoes the spirit never come to you and say the monies in the bag on the shoe bomb\nSure they do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and spirit or if you ask before you go if this applies to everyone before you go to sleep at night\nYou ask say please tell me if you continue to ask where is it usually you get an answer if you ask me maybe three times four times she should get an answer just it really hang in there with it and be diligent in your request\nKeep asking we were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or had just been given to you\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures here we've had a camera or two on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of spare photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of weird things going on and it's so interesting George maybe you can tell me that the reason why where this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye staying at wife has such a difference do you think\nIt's a huge difference and it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up ... or ... just about everything that you can't see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to to see things in a certain level a word that camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right that it's so odd and it's one of the cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would would a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirit has not tell me why but other than the fact\nThat the uh the photography scientific photography has the ability at the either not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far is not good\nYou know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is the train that deceased person somebody\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing person you test the spirit you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone thing\nBefore they become involved in this kind of work at all so you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is can come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that\nThey will not get past that barrier and if you're religious you say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves and very unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board\nNo and I know your feelings about the wage abroad and I agree with you I have a picture in my seven steps having book about my ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young as ... a ... and my brother that we're using a weed you brought in my living room and I was sitting on the couch watching them\nAnd we were\nAll very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside\nA demon face oh really that's in my book because I have a step\nThat's going to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety two fifty seven grudge got a birthday coming up I grabbed out\nA way Hey Greg\nWanting to test your ability because over the\nPast few decades have met the stakes maybe a handful of actually came up with predictions by thing like a you know with the Toyota Corona doing around that's how I got there and all this but the the others have worked off of the ... what do you think oh you should be speaker and this and that so that\nTime I should be anything but I'm telling you to death I Will say one thing about you [noise] I even have at the time of your breath at Mars a sign of grow up you say you a secret and you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the solving mysteries I Will say that to you and\nYou know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you got to answer isn't true so great to somebody I can do for you\nYeah I'm Wondering if you see predicting wise or something coming up from a career or my income wise change or to make it better [laughter]\nWell you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detected work anything like that\nNo I Do watch a lot of these uh\nGame shows where you've got to get the words [laughter]\nThat's a good start well are you starting a new career\nI'm not really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance or independent contract work with the you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you if if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that it's discovering mysteries you should really follow it along those lines out just kind of study forensic for bed and when you're not doing construction\nAnd you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain that is really exciting you're an honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field and honest so thank you saying that Greg\nGreg Kobe everything works out for you speaking of honesty joined should you see something bad will you tell that person\nYou have to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bad like\nMainly like shuttling accident in action and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid\nI had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen my guy told me not to go out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but\nOh man I take her out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but someone came on and sit down that we have to go to the beach we have to do this and that are really horrendous accident the guys who will tell you and if you're not told and you have the accident anyway that it's supposed to happen like you charge I don't believe in accidents\nNo and you know when you look back at the movie the Christmas carol would Scrooge is looking in the window with the goes to the future that spirit or these things that will be or could be ... and that's a that's an interesting question do you think we have the ability to change our destiny\nI think as you raise your consciousness grow and are aware of this and you grow and truth and love and light and understanding you absolutely can that's why we're here with the it's a school this is one big school charging you know it\nAnd a tearful lessons you too well you know you have to experience something really nasty and bypass it\nLet's go to bowl in Wichita, Kansas ...

and\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed to 'cause they're wake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and said no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dream because we think that our dreams are giving us a luring pictures\nA possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right below the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see in our waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the simple suggestion that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recording and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with you might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nFor them to you can dream wide way the world around you will speak the language of science and symbols and things but as you pay attention and sometimes you get Mora look\nTo the pop up so that like pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage to dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a tree movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation and trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I might of the stories I I picked a sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they had to keep on making the same\nTime but this is not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe but very strange women who sat down next to me and the plain old reality and mentioned me at a certain point the dead have been to the ... he was a ... musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle on\nThe news that he creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects\n[laughter] the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dream\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might you the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you've become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self made people cite the wiser and fight the highest though is the director\nI don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to is not hostile to you and it's probably being run by someone with a slightly why is the perspective\nAnd maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock is awake into doing some course correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams or partial Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current under staffed by kind of understanding I mean the really ready to revive quite ancient understanding about dreams that dream is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information\nIs that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to harvest the information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the Post's no doorway into this whole bunch of information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you could set an intention any night for example would be very simple about this very simple practical\nYou can do dream in basements being juice at an intention to get guidance on anything that interest even probably something will come through if you think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some breast and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of ... narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science mhm elegy in the aughts\nEven in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up what

on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a thought of preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver an incident or sign king\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down

the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd do what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tapes and I've got something for you come on down it works doesn't it\nYes wow you're than the Europe be met and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain

be in contact with not mailing it he just right on\nAnd on that I noticed was followed the news said that actually almost didn't celebrate that was a response so you're practicing a game that is an

new age but the laws attraction it's always in play the law of attraction means that we tracked over a pill events or encounters according to the energy and the ideas we carry\nIt works at all levels

would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio is trying to find his way out of the ship is all these moving parts\nApropos as are trying to find his way out of the ship that oil is moving parts and they still has that team they still wants to stay with us girlfriend in the movie or you know it still has also about the relationship so the idea of a dream\nShowing moving parts and my second thing just as you're talking now I was thinking of a\nI had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I noticed\nA couple of times like
