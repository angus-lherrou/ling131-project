gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that's scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes and clearer just continually sweeps and they can that that's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and others found sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick sparse moments as its scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is trying to exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex so eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and you are a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John ... who was using his scene stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that used to have a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that\nIf this is something that human beings have been attempting to deal with some media mystic device some material device\nWhere we take some pain and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker where we're really trying to interact with\nOur technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers\nThat have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you\nStart the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something in an interview with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the column as it's called particularly the call him a Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to hell\nAll but usually the coal to Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um we're being attacked or there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves and eventually the goal of becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it it there's chaos as soon as the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it or you have to put it to sleep\nIt one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories\nBut if you look at the actual Jewish ... missed this as a\nMystical writings about the call them\nThe goal of them is in some ways\nAnd means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their\nSpiritual accurate man it's it's almost like a half to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the column itself is was understood by the rabbis the beaches kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi go to the head rabbi and they show him that goal in the sense that that well what can I Do kind of speak\nAnd they say well no it can't speak and he said well then what good is that it's just a it's just the toy\nWhich is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so\nWe can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne is that we're\nHere what about the Sherman says

also used in utilize sound and\nLight off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states have consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access and connect the technology to the history of spiritualism and the aging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't\nGo to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be and chanted we watch it in that state of mind and so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... that\nSure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists to rationalize\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk in because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want there to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and not\nKnow Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had two days equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] maybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes founded that people were using these things but if you should have\nA you know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most likely trying to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back

[noise]\nAbout the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by\nBy being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and and so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say\nYou know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive that's why people have practiced magic for millennium right just another example of magic of\nA of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool and I\nWe put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it on the Internet is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to their show why some people are\nLike this goes you know back to the whole idea that we\nOnce used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these teams consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes or radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against\nAnd yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nIt's underneath it and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that at the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to you and should Peter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's alter he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or but my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right kind of receiver\nWell fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual ism was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph\n[laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah it is the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company\nIn Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company\nAnd they actually they this is how they advertise their television this is what they've said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate chef in VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is\nFilled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we\nTalk about technology even if we're not believers in it even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dump does has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely\nYeah my dad had an old field goal radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wooden furniture\nAnd had silicone written across it uh you know it was it was a piece of art in the same we have TVs in the in the cereals that they started coming out with\nIts right these are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about this about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous\nStates are in chanting states when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and told me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but that we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers\nThere's a movement of what's called trans humanism and hosts humanist\nWho believe that we will become so merged with technology that that we will become the new spirit world that it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this

remember the Catholic bishops Fulton Sheen\nOh absolutely yeah with a white a life worth living he used to have is angel that's right on the board and then he'd go off can go to you know a different

it all happen um that these miracles happened over the television\nYeah that's true that's absolutely true technology at its best\nI think somebody's going to come up with something somewhere I think don't you\nI mean some you know we can only become more advanced and it's going to be interesting to see if one day these different parts of our lives can really merge in some way and\nA these different parts of our lives can really merge in some way and maybe it's technology that's going to make that possible\nLet's go to Carolyn are hemmed in Connecticut now Hi Carol thanks for calling\nHi or maybe you haven't had anyone tell you about a strange intent than than what they are the D. player or I go ahead\nIf what happened was I was writing a one block past where my son used to work and anti in between the songs on the CD it's about five seven second and uh all of a sudden I hear a young boy hey don't drive that way\nNo one no one has any access to my CDs my anything and I'm looking around on a thing where it's coming from is coming from the thing and it never happened again I played it over and over again never hadn't done any other CD's\nDo drives that all of the advice of a choice either but it said you didn't it Carol\n[noise] well I don't know if that if you just don't don't cut through past where I'm I'm always aware I worked\nOr maybe a trained me a car was going to go out like that or\nYeah or or maybe an accent but I just drove the exact same Lincoln needed\nBut you were what were you aware of it were you thinking a little bit more\nI mean the thing about it [laughter]\nI can you know in between absolutely quiet you know you know a a pretty new city and I played it over and over again and I just thought you'd you'd want to know about a CD incident where you say there's radio you know am FM or whatever we think this is just said hey\nAll right it's pretty ... pretty soon it'll be popping up on podcasts Peter\nTried exactly what goes\nTo the whole range of electronic voice phenomenal I mean the earliest researchers weren't using radios they were using white noise\nThey were used in just a quiet room with a microphone it was it wasn't so much about the the vice itself it was the fact that they it was electronic media it was making this possible some record about media whether it was a tape 'em or in this case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people do not\nReact to that little angel shooting on their shoulder whispering in their ear\nTelling them don't do this ... here go straight to stop you have to be able to\nDetermine when to do these things right\nBecause if you don't you could miss a great opportunity or you could get killed or something like that and put out\nAbsolutely and how do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experience but maybe you know maybe sometimes we project these things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it stopped the spirit world communicating to us with the with the um\nRadio or with the tape player maybe a thorough and unconscious\nOur own spirits that are trying to communicate something to watch that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was easy or difficult for you to get it started\n[noise] well part of the problem for me was is that each one of the subjects that I took up there's been you know decades of research and books about them so\nWhat I Would have to try to figure out a way to do is take all this material and and turned it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about these specific thing I mean the history of\nThere's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography but I wanted to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work\nAnd doing show take up\nYou know some of the important background information but yes it ... it was difficult than I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand is that\nNo matter how you want to approach these subjects whether you want to approach them to the skeptic or as a full on believer or the way that I liked to approach them more as a journalist and historian that\nPeople are worried when you bring up or it's like ... for natural are called they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or if you're coming at it\nFrom them on the way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with these subjects at all poses problems sometimes when I'm asking to interview somebody and they're a little bit mistrust sure my intentions might be\nWell in a lot of people Peter when they hear the word a cult think coast it's sickness sport double back

George ... professor thanks so much for taking my call and I'm a\nI'm a I just want to chime in real quick on this whole angel thing I'm I'm I'm God believer a crisis follower and I make no bones about it obviously are coming to this conversation with a little bit of a bias but\nUm I guess the caution I wanted to get to those those of us in the audience that are of like mind is that is to use caution with the amount of emphasis that you put on trying to seek out\nThe guardian angel aspect and and I guess we get dangerously close to worshipping\nThe the angels in worshipping the people that God's putting our lives to help us\nI'm a father I've got a young kids and it wasn't until I got kids that are really understood the whole concept of love like I Do now I Believe God loves is very very deeply so much so we can't even understand it and if my kid you know got hurt and got sick out whatever I needed a seeing eye dog for example\nAnd my kid loves the dog my kid loves the dog but then my kids love my dog that I gave him to help him\nGet through his handicap more than he loves me\nI guess as a father and my heart would be heartbroken that I Would lose out on the full relations but I Would have with my kid and I guess to the extent that many of us try to\nSeek out the angels more than we seek out God the father of God the creator I guess there's a danger and losing a full relationship we can have with our God\nI think it's a different kind of love Rick I'm you know it's it's like with your children if you have three kids you love them all but differently\nPeter would you agree\nYeah yeah yeah I and I think that it gets to you know why people are ... with the idea of of saint says well that they gave us and it didn't it goes back to what we're talking about overall

professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was the Hungarian born American illusion this stump performer noted for his sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S\nAnd that is Sherrie ... got a tour of Europe where he challenged police force has to keep him locked up\nSunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath inside a shield milk Ken what the water in it Ninety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups\nCommissioned by London's daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour and another ... buried alive only just able to ... himself to the surface or birds you know the state of near break down\nNow what many suspected that these are scape sport faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge of fake spiritual is he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her he was not successful\nHe told his wife bash that when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back every Houdini died on October thirty first Halloween Nineteen twenty six in Detroit Michigan\nOn October thirty first Nineteen thirty six ten years later that the Knickerbocker hotel in Hollywood, California they conducted a say on ... to try to find didn't reach Harry Houdini\nWho the substances that what happened\nYes yeah it was a\n... so it saps assault through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work during those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he and death that worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds or since before Nineteen Thirteen [noise]\nThey had this it's a two way code they worked out if one of them died that they would uh use this code\nContact each other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget what the uh medium ... what happens\nIf aren't the report was a trance medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which ...\nFrom and where would you like she's like was was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a post\nDoc he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes asleep okay like like Casey all righty goes into the trench state\nRight he just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember\nUh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses and in one of them he contacted Houdini some other\nAbout a year before this and then he starts having these dances and he starts getting the code now Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words\nThat spell another word and then she it's a two way code I'm Beth has five words in French that she says back to him\nNow does that make sense to you and everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side\nOne word or something you're going to get it across\nAnd then they're going to know that you're there but\nAgain it was sharper than that who team said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him so this was an ingenious code really at because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wow\nWhy why was here we professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody knew what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nFirst do skiing\nRight he was a ... ... it just had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nYeah she was that's true so\nHe had to be first it matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy um I think he would have been I think you would have had a movie um\nCareer mogul yeah it had he survived she invented what they call now the dailies\nUh in in the movie industry he invented that\nIn a rush cuts right yes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grave to do it he was\nGoing to do was going to do it and do you think it was successful\n[noise] I I Know ... all I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nDidn't know that for a fact did come for professor bash his wife\nThe best was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed but ... you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some well I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and\nShe uh\nWhile he was alive and asking died\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was ... stock market yeah\nSo she loses the majority of her friends\nOh she was arrested in the stock market oh yeah\nOh she loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending\nMoney like it grows on trees she just\nAnd I guess Harry left are nice little sum huh\nYeah he left her a part of the uh\nThey pay\nDamn needy or whatever for his ah insurance\nInsurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money that\nRight product that's close to a million dollars um so\nHow about that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched mhm and\nSo it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court\nSo she got fifty thousand\nSo she was rolling and do know and then she they put it all in a market and she'll off at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the Kurdish\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part show the first part of a show with magic mhm second part was the ... scape would do in Cape that was where the water or Chinese water torture cell or the uh the\nMilk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go out for the spiritual life and he would have had this um confrontation with them\n... felt like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party would go out to a palm reader or somebody uh uh that he considered fake and you go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be on him and he'd go in and find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark\nOr some of the I found it I got to you know and\nThen they're broadly attached to a string or something like that\nRight so ... and of course the the medium to adjust my ah where do you do that I didn't I have nothing to do that\nWell they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician in a magician always have what you're going out on the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and that's something the healthy switched to the next one and you switch to the next\nOne and and at work so you're assured of success\nAnd so in his magic that's built in in the states of course I'm I guarantee you got two or three keys in there you know and if that failed and he couldn't get the T that's would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate tea in her mouth\nA and just spend it into his mouth exactly how\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was actually the same thing for the spiritual\nSpirituals because he had an agent and she would go into town and she would find some hanging fruit you would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't\nFind what they're doing and she couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini at a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere put the curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie he Marjorie with the uh the which from Boston um\nHold on for ... seconds a professor we're we're in a break but we'll come right back and talk about the ... that killed Houdini\nDon't forget to watch a TV show

F. that James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never had to\nWrite they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participant\n[laughter] um they were like you for that one\nYeah uh well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year\nTalking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead so anyway the ah\nThe Scientific American has the same kind of thing going on\nSo they're always going to Marjory he's\nSaying on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send 'em ... that's the agents that easily sent ahead what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box\nAnd he has um James Collins build it for him and he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only means head in our hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get at anything so who d'nese got to make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they ah do once they aren't in everything goes according to plan and ah they have what they call a ballot box that so little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the only I had the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now ah and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first ... the bell rings\nSo the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it\nRight and they put it that and the second say on the bell rings a bell\nSo now he's got a picture and liberal we talked about before about\nThere's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her how he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out so we have to expose her so she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the fans and of course Marjorie\nHave a spirit guide\nAnd his name is Walter and its Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nThis is this is this and this was the spirit saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit watcher puts a death occurs because inside the box is a ruler one of those ... rulers pulls up into three pieces\nYup is one of those are all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini while and a James Collins\nHow soon ... was the curse a professor and then we ended up dying\nWell the ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year and that's a\nYou know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini\nUsed it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd die at any moment\nYeah and it really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets sick\nMaybe this is in the back of his mind\nAnd so he doesn't go to the doctor\n'cause he doesn't he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini\nHe outlive all uh she lived until Seventy one oh wow okay Arthur poured lived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he\nFails but he says he does it and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the\nBut he says he doesn't and he's got these photos of Marjory flag under the\nTable mhm and then he had some drawings made were her leg and screeching around his leg so he makes them drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing oh\nA little little trickery by Houdini\nYet so Houdini once again is doing this and um\nThere was a guy named Walter ...

puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you are right\nExactly exactly I'm\nJames Collins when the guy that Houdini the built all of them for them but Houdini would say I want to do this\nAnd then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walk in Allison out everybody sees this thing

year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages she having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression\nSo she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math depression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back a nap breakfast with there every
