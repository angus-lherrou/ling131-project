country and a operates than Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God the Shiite um religious militia [noise]\nUm [noise] uh\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of living on in Nineteen eighty two um Lebanon as you know of ... split between the\nSunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the sheer\nWere always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leader of 'em were murdered in Libya\nAnd left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of Ayatollah Khomeini and Iran\nAnd the Iranian Revolution and they ... the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they ... they than um intelligence but with a knife that revolutionary guards and\nTo live and on with theory of blessing and they set of faith in living on and they establish among the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many inside the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journal the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence with everywhere um family of the the two people of the two groups that neglected this\nThis arrival and the amount of money and the amount of influence with uranium through spreading of Lebanon or the Israelis and the Americans to people that have um vested interest\nIn keeping 'em uranium way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than than any other group\nAmerican and Israeli blood on their hands than than any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on the U.S embassies in the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station\nChief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the\nOn the course of a kind of history a\nThat's never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nReally get into that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Well Fred heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nOn the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nOr and or or take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz the book is called the roots rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred didn't Samuel would you be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there in the if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset along fine rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power um Hezbollah has been transformed from an underground for\n'em in the Nineteen eighties the period we're for them I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger\nAlmost conventional armies in the middle east um it is for the United states in Iraq it was um\nIt was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to fill up there um I eat these um strategy and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm In two thousand ... launched a um horrific war against Israel where\nI'm laid siege I'm way of indiscriminate rocket fire\nAgainst Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with that we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has\nIf we were so them operatives in this country\nHas for many years and\nIt is an arm and extension of Iran was um\nA desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important for us national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets on they're giving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah\nBut why are we getting talks with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions\nWhy don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive\nAbout engaging Iran militarily are hostages were see is that the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and the the the bombing of the marine barracks which was um on the thirty five years ago um to this day\nOut on hold on for a second set and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book be rude rules next on coast to coast that you\nNever missed a detail in the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com [noise]\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian use of groups like Hezbollah\nTo export terrorism throughout the middle east and the rest of the world is daunting and the four um policy planners in this country for generations it was um directly responsible for\nA lack of response to suicide truck bombing\nOf the embassies the marine\nAnd the kidnapping of a serious station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the age of ...\nFor a burden tell us about what you Buckley\nA bill was a a a true patriot George ah he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalist we're talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story due to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a middle grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills a family has a\nElderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm at which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into 'em and it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets a hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nOr as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you know didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes under special forces\nAre and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl um who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and\nUh he he reminds me of the NYPD or cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know show don't fear they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after the devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so uh that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief uh um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so a bill is not a and a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on you know do\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um ... you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day\nA in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around it\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on been godly\nOr where you had also Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period are they really didn't exist\nYou could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job in that in that time period was a you're a single ... kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was a kitten\nAbout Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where are we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him an interest in at least button Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died\nAnd that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed deal and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for\nAll my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but\nUm it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA ... at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran or in another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nNot you certainly a smoking gun or as to who is directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak ambition wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not I\nThink if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture\nI'm Bill Buckley um revealed information I'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager\nOf the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon so he knew the names of the other agents he knew the name of their sources\nAnd he hit all that information I'm In his in his mind because he had to control it on the base\nThat he has to supervise it I'm One of the um\nYou know one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he was abducted um personnel in the station um retreated out of the ... out of the country are very very quickly because of their identity as would become known\n[noise] imagine the media with no conservatives ... that's what we have a foreign rush rush Limbaugh delivered on WG a W College Station Bryan\nCaravan there's urge to call it off flood jak Callahan Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo wanting the thousands of people trudging through Mexico toward the U.S border there is a dead end ahead of\nThem you will not be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what\nI repeat the care of and will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances secretary\nPompeo says the U.S we'll protected suffering to the state department also sanctioning several Saudis will have to be involved with the killing of ... several staffers of the royal security service on some members of the royal court losing their us visas the Turkish government is offering more insight into what they've learned that the killing\nTurkish president raging pay it aired on offered a broad outline of what he says investigators there have uncovered\nThat it hit team traveled ... disabled security cameras in the Saudi constantly and prepared to murder Jamal could show game aired on also asks for the location of democracy obese body and says Saudi teams were inspecting forest near is sample and in the northwest before his murder\nAs Richard said at the state department President Trump and Russia's president Vladimir Putin's we'll meet again on November eleventh in Paris\nAnd they both with him ceremonies marking the centennial of the end of World War one national security adviser John Bolton traveled to Moscow to gel president boot in the U.S will pull out of the IMF treaty struck between President Reagan and general secretary ...

change of the mathematical equation and to try something different\nTo try something where I'm different sorts of ... of landmarks in while still can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempted\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George good morning he bright\nHey listen ah name what about what a mess over there in the middle east and and and than it used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there at outside of Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decade and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is\nA must William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers but this\nHistory that nobody you know really remembers but if he gave up the road and I don't know you know begin or not was your any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the CIA that were out in the field\nUh from the information that he might have given up a man or keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question [noise] sure a good question\nBrian uh answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning a in essence they they removed all the ... personnel assigned to the station\nOr got them out of a country a shop or they had to shut down or their source network a and anticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat had access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example\nA Kenny horse trader swap with a let's say a B Russian KGB at the time [noise] so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so a was a operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shut down stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network which is never easy\nSam what's happening to Lebanon today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm has ... perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while\nI'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims that Israel\nHas below fighters were getting on on short on characteristic Lee I'm I'm a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities fighting in Syria um\nThe the\nLebanese fighters in\nIn in Syria have played a significant role in in off or\nBeing able to the Assad regime being able to remain in power um Hezbollah remains I'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've out pose some throughout the world including South America\nAnd um has remained very clear and present danger to the United states Israel and western interests throughout the middle east\nDrug why do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\nUm yes there is a very large population in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um [noise] um [noise] we learned that um the the government of president the door and Venezuela\nHad a um a a shuttle service on the Venezuelan UM Airlines troubling Damascus and I'm\nBringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way I got caught and then from then on the word dispersed throughout um points throughout the um Europe in the middle east um\nMoney the money from those cells were laundered I'm In West Africa\nUm some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car ring in the United states um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs shut up ... you know clinics to help people but legalize drugs don't put people in jail and will stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one where you're getting these people who are making all the Germans drugs and distributed um what do you think\nWell a large a large portion of his ... budget comes from um illegal activities and I I think that's um you know when we think about that we have to remember the more important than the religious elements more important for even sometimes\nFace sponsorship of terrorist organizations are criminal groups and they\nThey survive they thrive and they operate with um with criminal criminal gangs [noise] um ...\nAnd that's just that's where we're going to come back and wrap things up one final calls next on coast to coast [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nNow we're back with their final segment with red ... than Samuel Katz their work is going to be rude rules your website linked linked up it comes to ... dot com Freda want to get your take on these ... situation of course and\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed that the consulate butchered or I guess because of what is his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia or but geez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness Georgia I can never remember\nAnother incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of some bodies via similar methods that we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates or\nIn this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together\nA to actually do this or\nInside a diplomatic facility or with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world are you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and so ah either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this this uh based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then\nA few other a Saudi prince lives that have disappeared too so um\nSince ... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of royals away at the rich Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum\nOr I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a a effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place in and move forward\nOr you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos are there still are an intelligence provider\nThat that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with the double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are uh at times [laughter] yeah I'm a I'm sad to say and\nIt's just the nature of the business uh you know some a rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those don't or at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember or you know there are no friendly intelligence services that's the one mantra that you learn and and basic agent school is a there are no friendly intelligence services and in each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\nAnd ... could show apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer or non ... uh there was so you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office than a one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event uh\nThis is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe I mean he's more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know wasn't one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ... you know the poisoning\nOr you know so uh you know do do these intelligence services the these are a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they are going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person should get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish prison that's that's the one given\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx slits gonna started Tom go ahead\nI like to say that the leaders are horrendous caper is Yemen I mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name\nAnd how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take ... and make it a temporary a hot when the of the was\nNot for oil and that would go not a silver but for the sake of humanity to stop they get it from a sending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing gas or\nDo at least stabilize it that way and then there's another aspect\nBut is it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made a mess headed Libya\nAnd in the ... they they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think I tried that Tom ... sealed miserably so far ... of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course we know Boy Scout we hated the guy he was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid a you went straight gave up his new show in his new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh you know the state department or has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh\nAnd uh you look at bin ... I\nI'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization mild outfit is hired more agents\nAh they've they've now train they now training protect with buildings on fire or they've worked with empty and wide to develop protocols for that uh as an agent uh I was never trained at the state department or a ... as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so there's\nBeen a lot of lessons learned and a lot of changes made in protection\nA ... he was a mess I I mean and bachelor Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh or as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya or they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been and um\nThe agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA um security support team were heroes you know they can and ah and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but uh [noise] um it's just a a another long list\nOf disasters that have happened and and [noise] um let's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon\nHow many Libyans storm our embassy\nI'm Sandy recall the exact

I had everything out of its own post office and edits on newspaper and\nYou know had a job section real estate company there's even a dating service there but it turns out that this this time never existed um\nAnyone who went to the land coordinate given to you on a Google Map they would just find an empty field I'm no one really knows exactly\nWhat happened a one newspaper said that Google and the people who you know supplies mapping data you know I'm able to explain you know why they had this town on the map but when you actually go to the place it's not\nThere\nWhen the book you know we ... we we really can't you know figure out what is going on there and you know there is no UFO activity near the place a military activity to one person to call this a what better place for government to hide secrets then at that time that never existed um it seems to be some kind of um\nDrill or some kind of how to you know for some reason maybe some intelligence services want to know what it's like to create a phantom time well they did it in the middle of England\nThat's weird isn't it yeah it sure is in a\nStrange stories like that all the time we were talking about your photos and that you've never seen one than I saw a couple with night vision goggles in your opinion based on your research were some of the best places in the United states to spot UFOs\nUh-huh well you know it's funny I'm\nThere there's let's say a top three or four but one of them is a place called elk river Minnesota\nAnd there's nothing really you know extraordinary about this place except a standing a few years ago people started seeing UFOs almost on a daily or let's say a nightly basis and uh it's just a small community it's it's ... fishing and and and I'm\nA scheme men are than anything else but what's strange about it is not only do people see UFOs frequently there but they're not your typical you up for some of them look like a one person said that\nUh they saw one that you know\nIt looked like a huge jellyfish or others look like\nYou know just very lied you reach a some of the size of ... some of them are you know small is basketball's but for whatever reason is that they want to congregate around a little elk river Minnesota that's one place or another interesting places Stephenville, Texas which is down near where I'm\nAt George W Bush's ranch is and there was a major citing down there years ago and in two thousand I ate where\nSome people saw a a UFO being chased by at sixteen fighters or Airforce fight as other people saw a large UFO being escorted by F. sixteen fighters and it happened right near where a judge Bush's ranchers\nAnd apparently you know down in that part of Texas if you keep your eyes open and go out at night and maybe get those night vision goggles you could see lots of different things\nDo you think his ranch in anything to do with where they you know\nI ... I don't know you know I think the whole idea that some of the witnesses they had a lot of witnesses and um\nSome of the thought that the our fighters were chasing the UFO but then other people swear they that they saw them playing alongside of like they're escorting at 'em and just the fact that it was his ranch you know who knows but um yeah that's that's ... and ... it's still today as a place where if you want to\nTake the time to get down there are people see you all falls on a regular basis Gulf breeze Florida which had a um a controversy many years ago where a guy named Edwin ... came up with lots of photographs very detail photographed\nGreene story reached right\nAnd and and then you know I have some people want\nStory reached right and and and then\nYou know I have some people went to great lengths to prove or in their minds any way that you know these hoaxes but the strange thing is is that people still get down there and people still see odd things in the sky and they still take pictures of them still\nDetail than almost looked like the ones that are ed Walters had so um what's whatever's flying around up there you know there's a good chance you're going to see it if you get down and go brief\nWhat's your best celebrity ...\n[noise] well um it has to be a William Shatner or because you know he's he's kind of a character no matter what\n\nHe told the story early in his life that he was a out in the Mojave Desert and his motorcycle and it broke down\nAnd it was stranded it was a hundred and thirty degrees out he had no water when he said a mysterious object appeared overhead and guided him to a gas station um\nBut later on in his autobiography ... of the story design a biography telling the New York times his quote was I told the truth that I lied and I know that just seems like ... to me you know um\nAnother one was a Mick Jagger and was um\nIf he can believe in camping with his girlfriend ...

that we'll Winston Churchill during World War two someone gave him a very detailed photograph of what they called to fight as back then but the UFOs\nAs he did not want that released to the public relations\nYeah that's right because he he thought all religion would fail that that was histories and all that you know while religion is\nBased on earth based in if we find out that you know we're not dealing with in the universe it put some new questions on um a lot of the major religions show you know can we not handle it I don't believe that I think they were the vast majority of people on this or I\nWant to know what's going on what we'd like to know that there were other being's out there you know it's what it once again it would be like the greatest story it in and all of history why
