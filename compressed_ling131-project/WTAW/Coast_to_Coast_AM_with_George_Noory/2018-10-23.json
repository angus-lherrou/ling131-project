like we're going to go to Mars plan um either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes us there um space sex is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be fully be usable\nOr to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully reusable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars uh\nAnd if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must like to skate next to the edge of the ice\nIs um they got a blue origin company by a led by ... the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so uh well we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is that was great work with its robotic planetary missions Senate space astronomy missions uh their work in that field is epic bought the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable\nPlan to do that and um so I think it's going to be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy that privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like speeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA is a human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster is NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but I mean it's really sad to see this program I mean that storm have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem and [laughter] ... what happened in Nineteen sixty nine\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who don't that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is\nTotally crazy it's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon\nIt's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission\nI mean let let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter] the the the\nI call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the ... here's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building\nAnd you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill to pass on that they had to deal and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you'd probably sell me what you buy the ... and you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land than with this ... ...\n... you know with ... doing what he's doing falcon next base sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and knocked up rebuilt the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nUh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we've had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class\nIn terms of its ability to execute great projects and and act on the basis of public spirit instead of heart is in a chaos\nAnd the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who\nPreceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping brightest spine would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance to witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and\nHalf the people who are looking into the guys that night uh they didn't know what it was they thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is although I mean one might say it's about time ah because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that must kiss done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and\nAnd he is reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time\nThat any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron are these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nOr two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the us space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents all this has just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people then say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem with it [noise] and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be in a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours [noise] next on coast to coast\nThey I'm always on your phone and you'll be happy to know the ... website is no optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nAh driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's not what he's about\nUh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books\nFor doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants the terminal glory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish\nHe he um and he certainly um\nI'm\nNot above using people are and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you know a ... you know there is um ...\nYou know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches eagle back but\nIt's not exactly\nGo it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the only had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know\nUh and when he gets to that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds of war against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must be a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out\nUh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific\nUh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you come from the just results Robert\nWell Jeff we use those as much calmer a much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect that\nA mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why it is limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him\nSo this is the you know ... the hair um blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as richest mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money okay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that\nI'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time or the quicker you just do something to cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it costs much less\nUh because uh\nYou know space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nYeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European but all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm somebody is not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground and um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro\nFound an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars\nI mean um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth some of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water\nThe surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers of pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust\nKnows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it is as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which by the way it's the same latitude a San Francisco so imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that the the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that you lose life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's there's\nTwo they there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you\nI mean look if if it how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did\nWell for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nDinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and\nAnd and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it it's all been a a trick by tricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd um so\nIf you believe\nGet rid of the buses and noises given new HD Radio for your car and home and heroes

one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just to run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one in Lear jets and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the spacecraft crates and typical force that mimics gravity\nAnd that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with um\nZero gravity for long range for a long long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo broad liberal do anything for you\nRight and then the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and [noise] um electric propulsion is using a electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate\n... pounds to very high velocity she'd get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot and that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems are kinda like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from\nZero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town but if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car and you know in San Francisco and um you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world\nYou've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world ... park and drive over water in this case\nBut in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical caution\nIf because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there on the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would uh be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and ... got much more resources so mean to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to greet you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with the go to the moon don't come up with\nSome other thing that the halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nOr can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber wears the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall\nBut a couple of questions are in deep space [noise]\nUh when we send out these probes are what you are or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even\nOpen space as opposed to the planet and\nWould it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes and case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined what CEO to increase was uh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme\nHeat and space help us to deal with the\nPotentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship ... to Mars what type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called\nA and if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not um but um\n\nYou know\nWe do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most as much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast food you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back well ah let them finish up your questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in a moment of coast to coast am\nFeeling

I mean we had to hire him\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell\nAnd that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population so if you think about this as humans man you\nWe both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions um there is a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was\nPeople who are environmentally sensitive have longstanding allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just an\nOvert sensitivity to light found my\nCity and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all get ashes [laughter] so he's environmentally sensitive people actually have way way way more paranormal experiences and the general population\nUm there's those higher it's a really high number and what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's ex federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment the tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAre and they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up or the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which\nThere's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity so there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying\nThese people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that\nIn that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in and when I go out there and I my\nResearch was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and once you find is you know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something\nKind of like most you know genetic diseases or or whatnot is kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people you know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know it affects them\nProbably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows my criticism them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of ... billion donor\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do this three minute one hour program and not have anything to show looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility solution ...\nYeah I think yeah\nI think it it it really does too because it implies that\nEither people are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried types of\nThings so we we talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot grows too few goes more than others but what about the ... ... does that come back more often than others because they have an ability to do that\n\nUm I think it's really I guess which one is stronger in in when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know\nBe more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so\nYou know it and ...\nAnd that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive person um they're going to have way way way more votes encounters and um so I think it has to do\nFear prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes for encounter the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff you know I go from place to place to place throughout my day\nHowever one location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of goes Lee phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it but then you start asking yourself why why that place and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\nThem out of the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here one\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out\nThe right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with goes the encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients are variable that line up the habit goes and counter location is one\nPerson has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric a consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me early\nReligions I remember when my dad brought home a better TV and\nYou know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it that you clicked in brought into signal better that way too and I taught for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brandon\n[laughter] I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you have or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and\nI'm I get that question a lot though the the theme of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start\nMaybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good the bad weather the positive whether this was at that\nAnd I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic mhm demonic team as\nMore of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes I think there's more of a religious pills to it\nUm that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um but I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of thing so I I really\nJust enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWe're with

interviewed a number of people with some peace studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites\nSure sure ah so I have several real life accounts that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween is approaching I'll\nI'll I'll go with this one perfect um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife passed away unexpectedly over the summer\nWhile it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approached I was putting up decorations as the kids in the neighborhood usually a lot of trick or treating\nMy wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we have places plastic ... plastic pumpkin at our window every Halloween I searched house for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my faith and the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen\nOff the top shelf\nSo this\nIs a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting ghost interacting with us so\nIn this case you know the ghost during his ghostly encounter the ghost had a conscience and she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness\nUm they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on that are on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that so this direct interaction um it's sort of the ...\nThe cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters a and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare\nWhen you have like um the intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nZero pecking order on the other side burned in in in your opinion on what's already I mean\nWho ... to go back to do what it does does it do it on June or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um\nAre after we die you know what happens to that\nRight or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories or it just pieces to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things if consciousness survive death and it goes in and it continues to exist it's it could maybe really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like ... example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past life\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as\nYou know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates\nWith the consciousness of of a path loved ones and then these experience maybe happen so yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment is is really important\nUh Michael pursing or who recently passed away but it was a neuropsychologist basically said\nAnd he did all of the numbers by this but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist in it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln to Billy the kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he's great experiences happen\n[noise] what do you see the skeptics brand did you see these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable worship the wars\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say well you're crazy and they kind of said jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy I'm\nSo ... you know what I usually tell people who ... skeptics or or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed um mental health and and um you\nKnow you see it all\nYeah I mean my job I I work in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments unmet floors in the ER and I've I've done it probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years um so I Know how to parcel out\nYou know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um\nNinety nine point nine percent of them are from people who are genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience\nThat's huge yeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or that or your unstable or elusive dating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nBut less than a ... in my professional opinion lotteries goes encounters are the the they're genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as a true skeptic ... open mind\n... exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right because\nYou can just in golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes through everything that goes it's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read\nThat believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's\nFraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the central when it comes to being involved in the paranoia\nUptick for I'm pretty much a majority of my life what change do\nYou know I I when people were telling me and I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but I never had to experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people would tell me\nExperiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people were telling me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I wouldn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening and then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening\nAnd I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like\nUm Carl Young's collective unconscious show drags stuff I'm Harold ... life fields\nJournal read Raymond Moody's work\nYes exactly a near death experiences all this stuff and you start reading it and you go\nWait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle man and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible\nAnd then you know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year um I I Know\nEvery year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that come up at the end ESPN aside phenomenon is legit and then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this and these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kinda what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part of thing\nHe was another one of my favorite stories\nOr I I got a lot of them so uh [noise]\nWe'll go with will go with one that's been pretty popular here

national and knew we had to hire and\nI don't know how we found out through in Lincoln job\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling ghost come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams and the brain that might explain to an extent why\nPeople see ghost like others I've seen film of the baby ... chicks\nBeing fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother still wouldn't return to the wild the ships noted key in on a mother of conned or are you mentioned the window we're who was searching for the

different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a occurred within me a different figures in all different kinds of apps and some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not close by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that\nLake with a window we're a scene whose wife saying look uh\nUh in the back of the garage [laughter] can't imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached immediately like a husband who was white that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's it\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else so it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him\nYou know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars\nOthers radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's when these sort of experience has happened as far as an imprint goes\nI'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious so were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blue\nSo were all born with these archetype and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted\nUm with with with these archetypes in with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nVision and stories and things like that but I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes there out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nIt does religion kind of changed your views about ah these operations in grossly encounters\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes argues and I basically changes our perception of an experience so\nYou know you can have someone who is a devout religious person at the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might\nA perceived that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel or I'm a of of a sign from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious tell to it might experience that I simply\nYou know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone\nEvery once passed sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon um and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in\nAnd if they believe in earth bounce spirits everything is in our found spirit a so I think perception religion or they play a huge part how we perceive a ghostly counters impaired on the phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nWell yeah it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I've kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me at the careful what you wish for those types\nOf foods that you know [laughter] so I don't wish there'll be a part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I'd love to sort of be pardoned sort of gained some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions jumps and you know how they can get this demon disappearing deem it or not the person system and you know be gone in ... it's really weird and remarkable at the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it it's but my brain always goes to there's there's so\nMuch misinformation and\nMismanagement of things like that and possibly fraud that I I'd have to be there to experience it for me to go okay yeah I Believe that\nLet's go to Shelley in North Dakota Hi Sally go ahead\nWell hi either you know I mean I'm ...\nI'm gonna talk about a serious\nCar wreck when apple\nAt my well my daughter Christian you know and she was down on the lake just having a laugh\n[noise] and uh she came home with their ... and ah my hands and then I came home early from a bank rally and he had paid or twenty dollars to mow the lawn mhm and it's\nA pretty big blonde\nAnd he said well she got her money you know kind of start chance chicken and she just I didn't I checked his son ... body nice ... channel I can't see she she\nCan get it done in the new deal cake\nAnd then I had to go to work and Pete\nHer stepfather laid down on the couch and\n[noise] [noise] well I'm laughing sarver then what happened she got into her car\nShe got into her car it was a ... bar which she always felt like was the ... car and then her boyfriend was there and he\nKnew who was on who are in the back it up and who was driving a car smelling she was\nShe was driving car George and she didn't wear\nA shirt here\nAnd so you know the two can were like Eighteen Nineteen years old and they were kind of to manage\nWell then let me ask you this is Shelley are you getting visitations from her now\nHave George Hans\nAnd a lot is known rings and there's nobody there\nStrange phone numbers no doubt the caller i._d.\nRight right I think she's trying to communicate with you\nI think too I feel that\nI'm sure that you\nMay be the rich get Brandon ... take on that when we come back and just a moment Brandon remembered the story and ah let's just get your reaction to that because I Do think loved ones\nDuring moments of tragedy like that do try to make an effort to come back and communicate that does happen we'll be back in the moment with spinal calls from coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of it goes to ... am happy

in North Dakota has the situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring she's she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this and the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose called telephone calls from the dead\nWhich he encompasses a great ... less a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's the phantom menace messages but just recently came out as well which goes over this is well\nIt's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electrical of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this and there was times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistent Caesar similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon ...\nAh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening uh it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point go start measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable at well which is essentially everything that the scientific method hey\nI'm so these things are are tough and and that's kinda why most people go into its fried or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know we did is that a cop out though to be able to just to see the\nAh I think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to\nUm rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just stay out of the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination and then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way so it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that\nYou know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know\nThere's all this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's\nUm but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaire that all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and with skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigation of the year and there's\nYou know I don't know three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big\nAnd then academia take notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variable are on some similarities inconsistencies and then you have measurable phenomenon [noise] so\nUm some similarities inconsistencies and then you've got measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue I'm with someone who has a closed mind but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up\nAnd that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's there's things you can push a more towards the little with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom truck driving in Pennsylvania Tom going\nBy [noise] how are ya great thank you\nYeah I Want to talk to you guys come a long time listener first time caller so bear with me a little bit short\nStory I Am a back in Nineteen Seventy four and Eighteen Seventy five I was ten or eleven years old and we begin in New York split small house and upstate\nAnd I woke up in the middle of the I don't know why but there was a band getting there and he was goes with the thing that she didn't even hear the Spanish Military uniform\nAnd I'll never forget it I close my eyes open it back up and look at me like a slap myself a couple of times myself we weren't studying spoiled or anything like that\nAnd close the gap really are open them up and he was trying to say\nThen I close my eyes and he was standing back on the wall Street Journal look kinda slow but she was funny and I just walked through the wall whoa\nDid the uniform looked like it might have been from the Eighteen hundreds or something like that Tom\nThey change their early night he had the shoulders and uh I don't know who might not us fight but I don't know that they they had you know\nHe had a moustache she was a male\nWas there any kind of battle in that area a long time ago\nI don't think so in upstate New York you know farming community in an old farmhouse what the heck is the guy just I've never had another breeze with being in my whole life again you know poor now\nLet's bring the expert in Brandon what's a Spanish shoulder from the Eighteen hundreds doing in their\n... this is this is a fascinating story and and these are the stories that really gave me the most excited about this phenomenon right so how could there be a ghost of something that shouldn't be there right so if you have a house for a hundred and fifty years and there's no tragedy happening\nAnd all of a sudden there's a civil war goes that appears there right in this house is I'm In Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why is that well I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted sort of this in my book\nUm you know to me it's not so much location specific when it comes to a lot of these ... things that happen\nSo let's say let's go back to our caller Patrick distress messages right so I'm In Ohio\nAnd um I get into a car accident and end up dying I send to tell a path that distress message to my brother and a Montana and ah he wakes up in the middle of night sees an aberration of me and my in my clothes while I'm driving or whatever and I say good bye I Love you\nNow the operation didn't happen where I died it happened in Montana where my brother was living right\nSo let's say we skip I had a hundred and fifty years into the future someone by my brother's house\nAnd know tragedy happened there no nobody died there was a it was it was great place to live for all those years they walk into a room and they see an operation of me\nAnd they go what the heck is going on here\nNow the operation of me is that because I died and my brother's house it's the endpoint of might tell a path a distress call to my brother that he's picking up on\nSo in that case that the the heat the caller's talking about maybe there was someone that lived in that farmhouse who had um I'm a a cousin or a family member or perhaps even a husband\nWho was battling in the ... the Spanish Army and that he was dying he sent this tell the path that message that showed up in the form of an operation to this woman and the and the New York farmhouse", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "23"}
