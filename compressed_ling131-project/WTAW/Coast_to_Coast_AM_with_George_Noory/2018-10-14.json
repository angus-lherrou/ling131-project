then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... a brain synchronization kinds of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own\nChamber through their heads up\nNow is it like a cubicle or a ... and ... declined or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad\nOkay and you can if you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flow chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this\nIs controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nDo you have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on and\nYou know they they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typical you about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey is I have a friend who see this several times on wet winter the nanny think first of all the technology is the binary will be trying to get someone into a data state\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course\nAre ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by Nora will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on Germany where would you and I knew that pattern that you take the most you know it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or that relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided\nAustin guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance\nOften there she ate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed wife regressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say eye opening and mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nWhat's that going to open up to that are waking to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what types of questions could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise\nYou everybody receipt gets the journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you\nOr imagery cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they are waking to their their true self and they're the answers within um\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you find your help them I mean in a way your experience you William have\nDied in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my friend she's been a guest on the show before she said that\nShe has in the past encountered\nSouls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure uh we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mediate assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\n[noise] I I think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um and to that shift say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA [noise] a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where Massachusetts so you know what\nI have because I I ... I was\nPracticing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact\nAh during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just\nTotally disoriented let's put it that way a badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body is gone ...

I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear fear is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population\nOut and it's still used today right actively unfortunate way to control um you know society or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose playing\nYou know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way but surely they are insignificant when you compare him to how vast our\nOur universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by the external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff could you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself\nAnd you're no longer a pawn of anyone else any belief system government religion\nYou are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his ear uncle news that we\n... ridiculous that's and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one\nDay and knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that would occur mhm because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones who do connect [laughter]\nOr we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we don't I mean we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls to feel free to give us a call and I only think I'm listening to cook because damn [noise]\n... ... email newsletters out six days a week and it's a great way to keep up on all things ... with detailed program recaps the fascinating today in St Louis the upcoming just didn't bow and weekly free audio glimpse\nIt must have caused the recent up on the ... [noise]\nUm I was curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences in a memory loss\nOr questioned question you may not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... coalition a little bit of both are either long term memory and how the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like words and stuff like that and drive and things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not that I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory and on and and um she's when you have a brain trauma that not so much the antibody techniques it doesn't just serve their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I have not seen any correlation for that I have um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences have incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say so if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially\nUm certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n...\nEven in them than I\nCan relate to ... myself out so to speak you know yeah Mm make myself poll or whatnot with more functional so that's\nGreat that's great thank you so much for the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques and William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't to say she is with the TV I any type of trauma or brain injury we want to avoid those they\nThey are not time no no it's\nA unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do\nA for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death but the two were actually even though ... obese are part of the near death experience there are also independent of them\nSo it's important a distinction to make\nMm interesting um I go to Dave in New Jersey I well I like oh I I ... I eat in a\nHey Lisa the call is coming from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] All right so\nThis is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called

have ah let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we were perceived as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize that for instance you can live a life in five minutes it's ... it's there is no time as we perceive it ... in non physical reality\nIt's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical\n'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise] uh and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\n... that sounds ... can you ask in a long it takes you call it in my precinct and Lincoln you asked in going into and out of body Syrians\nAnd maybe your guest Jimmy question or how does he get something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your huh\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to ask you if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nAnd there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but have you ever ask yeah that's great\n[noise] um let's see if she did she are a wildcard line shoe berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call I had a question you know I guess I'm ... years ago while we were about ... idea that we're really close to the past ... really what we were ... and I'm going back and I just didn't let on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was the\nLeast about the time and I was chasing the suspect for a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the terror I mean it was my dad he was\nSmall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held those hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle down it's okay and uh I I wanted to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased Elise and he was gone and I walked up\nAfter I woke up I I get stressed that everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nLike this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the ... you know life after death around settled down because it actually work\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is or when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid a contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know he's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing\nYes it ... it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention

was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a goes named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise] Wilson started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that silly sue [laughter] you\nKnow innocent but then I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it in my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name [laughter] okay\nThe people and how old is your nephew advertising at this time next okay in\nOne night in the middle of the night\nHe came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks\nAnd he was leading okay he was leading and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was Ruth and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his his in his hand and I ran down to his room and he had cut the ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew I'm Sorry he kept calling it's due\nThis goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't once you any here anymore [laughter]\nAnd then how when did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you know I just I mean even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell the story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's silly stew he stole something again you know and I might find\nAll my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway and\nIt was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent but what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but Tom because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or menus I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was a good sign up for it all it is it's it's really strongly haunted spill you\nAnd you are still living there no milk no\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level and we took the door but now that the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it\nFelt like they were driving as crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what would happen to him\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen on a ledge was voted number six on\nThe nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the Lizzie Borden house by USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nAh it actually you know what about talk about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they clear at all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so I Am really\nWould take a lot of work they have done so much work man with ...\nWork but they have done so much work man with ... experts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really works ... apparently it worked because it it it's free [laughter] fascinating about a hundred years\nYeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so hot that [noise]\nAnd I don't get into that right now but I did find out that there is reason there always is any time something tragic or horrible happens\nIt leaves a psychic in in print or Bruins if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one in three years old and so\nUm they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal and I really believe it was because he just didn't want to eat [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind and want to become a doctor for like he\nTotally turned it out so all these years\nI think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he does his friends so young my step mom's that go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in managing these springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell that's I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yes\nOh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built lab on the top of pikes peak\nHe was fascinated with manatees springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic anomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around\nThe perimeter of the magnitude springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up\n... um you can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and\nIt ... they he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like kamikaze pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that\nFascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am leads to garner listening to coast to coast am\n\n\n\nMine mine [noise] mind you know while you're on open reviewing or [noise]\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not fight when they were here that's why they're holy sanctuary today would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever and tell Victorian came along and\nThe legend is that we started building you know the hotel\nThe legend is that we started building you know the hotels and what have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so haunted make sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does you know you live near\nI Do ... and you like it [laughter] you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here\nI Am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nFor you dead body it was awful he's and he was suicide um\nCome to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um processing\nIt but they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artists dancers singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere a and I see it happening to other people would I warned them\nMy a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and the bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit of mandatory Wilber took him and he goes I can\nFeel it I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well he got to be careful well he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process and energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like

story\nTrue I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter] pardon Jones about it okay about it it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student\nAnd I decided to go to this little mining town\nTo um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter] anyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because\nHer name had been tainted well I didn't know what to do when I got back to

crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do looking [laughter] is that an omen I don't know but you know what into thousands Thirteen it flooded again\nIt didn't work no right to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do that again yeah we do not somebody with a concept I mean there are\nCertain things should be said for the history tours and things that are being done in these secret lands mhm or hotels being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that the to the land that be and I give there is a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave and nice you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you come here because it's a choice\nYou Martin summoned to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said what brought you to manage to springs oh always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh I Am\nStories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you would would you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to do to transition wanted to move on already\nSee I think that when someone dies now I I Want to cut out this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe that's ferret lingers but they stay here some people\n[noise] or so that maybe this ... that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not at that with [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nIt's usually owns that particular place not\nSee eye earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes\nPeak Bible college it has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years I've never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased I Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they weren't howling\nLike going on I think that's a residual it's like a birth in time in a quantum physicist and explain it better than I can but I just think of it as like Brent toast you can still smell the burnt until it's gone yeah\nI Lived in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we mean by that means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense to have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like\nThey came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah\nSo yeah when I hear so I don't know the other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask a much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say it delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turn it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should move on\nTo move on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to assist this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works and what would you ask\nI tell it or you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind of person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these go centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's\nNot very nice looking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked\nThis where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those timing is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw\nSee that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby\nImagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] because other people have had a\nHabit enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now ... which do you started this wonderful conventions paranormal convention travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\nWell um we call it a moot movable fees like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historian and the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate\nWe are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of any does we're here we're not going to be like those guys though were really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\nThere's such a jerk [laughter] yes\nAnd that's what we do know and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there is very little\nInformation on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tours do change night by night and you never know which there is going to come out and play quite interesting\nYeah does that do stay with specific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay\nThere are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called ghost hunting as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch a darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then

like a cubicle or a day and a decline or well how do you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm In many ways

my class for instance people have passed life regressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo our inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I opening in mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nWhat's that going to open up to that are waking to that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what type two questions could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets the journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be sure imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to their their true self and they're the answers within um\nMhm yeah so the implication that\nPersonal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you guide your house and then I mean in a way your\nExperience you William have died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy

entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mediate assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well\nOr where people have contact\nAnd um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance I you know\nThat that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd I'm at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um and to let's just say a system to go to a higher

I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way a badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people that we're shifting those um\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and different cultures\nBut then I went to two ... we we presented in\nI think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a\nUnderstandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich is yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience within that\nI Want to find down a little bit more about what other cultures and does this and when it's cold in other countries are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you\nCan do this on your own and and live like that but against William moment I Am cigar and you're listening to science and\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am done gone\n\n\nOnly\nChecks path to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P.

I mean this is we're just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional beings that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing is face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to\nDiscover the answers for yourself\nAnd really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody I might try and show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death and um he had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years in doing is\nIs that\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life have to get things because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of report to people who have experience\nIs a life after life ... ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a load generation right is not you know for sure yes\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand bucks\nYou search will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic and it's not going to give you the insight and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nSuddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour\nAnd that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nMean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist they've been saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that world evolving beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our

I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear here is a control mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population\nA and it still used today right actively unfortunate way to control um you know societies or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose way and\nYou know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way they truly they are insignificant when you compare him to\nHow vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collective way otherwise when you have your own profound experience you you you can no longer be manipulated by\nThe external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself\nAnd you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion\nYou are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his his inner circle news that we\n... ridiculous that's and you realize it's\nYou know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge of self if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being not no ... none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nNext we really truly knew we were all connect and there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones who would be connected to [laughter]\nOr we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls to simply to give us a call and I'm listening to ... to ...\n... email newsletters sent out six days a week it was a great way to keep up on all things ... with detailed program recapture the fascinating today in St Louis the upcoming just didn't vote and weekly free audio clips\nOf must have caused fans look for the free sign up on the ... dot com ... [noise]\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences in a memory loss\nOr questioned question do you mean not remembering the experience or memory in Austin general\n... ... a little bit of both the uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself but not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall a certain things that you use all the time so to speak like words and stuff like that and drive and things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not I I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory and on and and um she's when you have a brain trauma type not so much he out of body technique it doesn't just serve their brain memory patterns and All right\nNo I have not seen any correlation for that I have um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences have incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say so if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially\nUm certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n...\nEven consumed them than I\nCan relate to the same thing on the phone if they do myself out so to speak you know yeah Mm make myself poll or whatnot with more functional so that's\nGreat that's great thank you so much for the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques and William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body channel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't to say she is with the TV I any type of trauma or brain injury we want to avoid those they\nThey are not time no no\nUh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do\nA for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death but the two were actually even know obese are part of the near death experience there are also independent of that\nSo it's important a distinction to make\nMm interesting um I go to Dave in New Jersey I well I like oh I I ... I eat in a\nHey Lisa the call is coming from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right [laughter] you know\nAnd this is where it might get a little weird when I was he a lawyer I was growing up with a place called ... town Pennsylvania we move there when I was about to where they started giving visitation\nThere were these patients they gave me um I first saw a ... a day a Catholic school\nOr I fell down a scapegoat by hands both by days where there's all those two girls and their mouths wouldn't try scaly it happened ... would tea or I saw the night before add to doubt but off they gave me a chance for Bybee\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar of\nFascinating is very cool too can be deeply competent is I mean\nYes they can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have ah let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes it's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it ... been non physical reality it's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\n... that sounds ... can you ask in along it thinks she called my ... and ... can you asked in going into and out of body Syrians\nAnd media destiny question or how to figure something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your huh\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to ask you if you have a question asked to get\nThe universe is willing to provide the answers your higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nAnd there is no limit to what can be\nLet's just say obtained um there's literally no limit ... but how do you have to ask\nYeah that's great [noise] um let's see if she did she are a wildcard line\nShoe berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call I had a question you know I guess I'm ... years ago while we were about ... idea that we're really close to the past ... really where we were ... and I'm going back and I just didn't let on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I hit the screen and that was the least about the time and I was chasing the suspect for a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my\nA mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not but it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held us hand up and he said you need to settle town it's okay\nAnd uh I I Want to talk with Eagle's actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't lead pleased all nice and he was gone and I walk up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from beyond you know life after death round settled down because it actually work\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high ... and often will perceive it and the dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid or contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact and that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing\nYeah said well it is\nVery healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to be a father in ... you remember him rather than any ... and I think it's a really wonderful intention and he basically did this technique it now and thank you for sharing that\nAnd that's given to me yes
