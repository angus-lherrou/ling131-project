represents emerging bashore logical wisdom was late breaking reporting in an online newspaper format he's done thousands of astrological consultations\nAnd mark welcome back to the program\nOh thank you George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nYou know we just started a great their enterprises that that's what I Want her to a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the art very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape or enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master Web designer it with very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going out to Langley\nWell there [laughter] that's what we've had a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things as we've said have been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer right and I went what what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much\nIt's it's really earth astrology global astrology is relative nations of world leaders thing with like eclipse is\nNew moon is full of major planetary alignment in other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that just as long um for the word again now people think of mundane kind of\nJust ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope piper readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWell again kind of ... the maker causing rather than microcosm and so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture\nOf national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of the way I was they read the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports\nBaseball football and so on so I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the\nWith the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there [noise] and I\nJust wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nThing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is strong ...\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to\nAncient Egypt the idea of a uh being called ...\nOr the the thrice great harmonies which is the actual Egyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years for the time of someone named Ptolemy who is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlantis\nOr when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics lived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people\nOn you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retro grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun\nUm we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets will tend to appear\nTo go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of like\nA this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into over the decades is mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if you if I went to Google or safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear and then you click on images it's still a little George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers ... would you get five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had\nSay a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same charter somebody or the same event and you ask them\nYou know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and\nOften you know people want to hear a prediction sure it's\nGoing to go however astrology really works best in terms of ... ... as you said and he studied it or not just psychology in UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I\nUse is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of as like I'll meet you at\nTen o'clock in the morning at such and such a place so that people think of time it's kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they\nPick their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around and the great circle and they're in different signs of the ... and ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of solar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate\nThe answer is basically I think that most of the straw ledgers kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just in Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance doing well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the mundane astrology church will things and so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic and intuitive\nBut I don't broadcast it but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd I scientifically in in sports you're astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer and his website great beer enterprises dot com or\nDo you want your GD beyond belief George Noreen just log on to beyond belief dot com\nCited by sir William Herschel and\nIronically in bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into tourists\nOkay and tourists as the main sign of money in New York Stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in all five years\nOr Iran spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of\nExtreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock some surprises your audience will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back uh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six to get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kinds of things like a nation's chart\nOf nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about Chris zones now crypto does\nThis this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that\nOver about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years the ...\nThe planets Jupiter and Saturn which is the largest planet so they've been actually looked at by people going back\nA couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were stronger is they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything\nExactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a\nWhat's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years Jupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it but what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only\nTwo years in a couple of months from now those two planets Jupiter and Saturn merge together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years\nAll the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air science and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more a serial that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world\nThe corporate world and all that so that we're we're ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nI guess you could say that's a\nVery stormy and um I\nWe do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles because so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things\nOn great pair enterprises in art or\nA earth Aquarius news zones so now earth Aquarius news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment engraved their enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend who said that he was drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with\nPresident Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it I think it's going to be hard to prove anything through\nUm you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology\nAlways limits in charge of a person although you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time off last Thursday\nJenna put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I had to hazard a guess you know I Would just say there are certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn ... in his place so it's not as if suddenly it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean well I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was the lure you think you'll get confirmed or\nNot I'm\nNot a logical you speaking well Esther logically we\nA logical you speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nYou hazard a guess on that side of the equation you still didn't answer me though\nI think it will get confirmed you do okay All right that that that that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll and I'll say now you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know\nA popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what are you saying what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing\nUm in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh\nThe secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize\nBy the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that and\nI sure did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what\nYou know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this is personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un it's gonna be\nThe leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trend\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump's chart is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time\nCould have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it so she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't\nKnow whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong on their report to his word in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans and people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMark telling me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year but I mean people are uptight or unhappy all talking about general not everybody\nI'm so glad you asked me that because\nIt's personal when we get adjusted to Rush Limbaugh what we think we say thanks big guy Rush Limbaugh

with the specific question\nI really you know not really an overall okay well\nWe're about to give you the overview bear with me computer I this is to take the um George hours when I'm doing now in in minutes or in a union and you'd\nBetter be minutes on this show right could you imagine the taking hours\nOkay or you have a it's interesting just like\nThe previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime you've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius aquariums\nNeed to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life\nAnd what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which\nAdds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also it's like equality interestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three five less devising have record more than even when you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you\nAlso if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle and I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of fed your terrorists well here's somebody Donna you're born with\nJupiter and said you Terry and so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter\nAnd Saturn so do something\nIn the world there was something you know where you're making\n'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or a neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant and and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out to amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with astrology\nWill because it's kind of like if if\nI were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is and it's right then you'd say okay\nAh looked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit will for how long you know and then come back to me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to\nTake you know have have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook but but when you have done it for\nForty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can see what's in the sky every day and they can\nThey can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into see the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of by Pisces what I Am when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say this I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I could do charts of compatibility with a loved one\nA deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible but well\nI Will say that first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage ... really\nYeah but the thing is that so that's very fine tuned I'm there we have ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ... so I I Would tell people to go to our strategy for thing and they couldn't put in their birth data and\nGet that relatively quickly for me to do things is you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get back current information both people but basically\nAstrologers have been doing this for a long time and it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for lots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human too real card\n[noise] well I've created to erode decks one with\nMy ex wife each uh uh we did enter trial courts which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years in so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball ... and I just ran into the gal ourselves the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of we're doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row\nLonger than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next the special callers birth date first of all November\nNineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Radley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois\nIn Delano well and how about a time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure the day time\nOkay do you have a question for mark who just want him to get going here\nI like the whole spiritual aspect to you know like a recurrent nation also another thing like that but I Wonder you know make a difference you know how you determine things as well I\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make it you know I I'm aware of the five different elements and those kind of things and the you know the ... the the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know it was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay while you're doing that we've done a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon war go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is the son signed Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas\nThat that is really talked about not so unusual that yeah\nI mean there are twelve five three callers all within areas man\nThat's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit\nIts own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion for a sports exercise and this person who just called\nUm has the moon and areas conjunction Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio was also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine because it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity um\nA lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making\nA ... a a crossing just finished three times on this individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably\nPart of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong to do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy I'm people of his son science Scorpio need to really get into these things I'm sort of in a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nYou pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I'm I often enter you know the different lotteries powerful and so on a five years ago I had four out of the five numbers Powerball didn't show up wow closest I've come that would have been a\nAlmost two million dollars minus whatever the feds would it take it but it didn't

chart\n[laughter] um\nI don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy young at a Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and credible gotten it for a long time and they just had and the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get\nWhich I think is really unique with that people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but\nMedia you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones um there\nThere may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final cool series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona hey Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark\nI'm happy I'm coming birthday to you my friend\nOh well thank you hey another year oh there you\nKnow [laughter] they keep clicking by do you have a question for mark or just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question was kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money laundering money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay a ... by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra\nAnd there was what's called parts like the part of the of earth part of marriage and so on something called the part a fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune\nFor Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also the moon as in the fight cancer and is rising in the first house a self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a Pisces ... and ... is\nFrom from the past from another life or other existence is in the past this person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world so\nAs an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun sign of the individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in the science so as far as relationship is concerned\nThe keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor I'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a it would be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually this person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even\nJesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from\nYou know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three going all around the world India possibly to Egypt going to a lasting very and\nIn England I mean these are kind of lower but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt a and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nOr anything else they're Albert\n... no just uh how is it my upcoming year looking\nWell Jupiter you have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nSo it into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series so those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with\nYou know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty in Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jean in Florida and she was born to forty in the morning a mark\nBoy you're going fifth November twentieth Nineteen fifty five what time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty a and let's go to Jane in Florida see what's on her mind tied Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going okay yeah any question for mark or just reading\n... um how about general meeting\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty\nEight now okay well uh kept her mom away [laughter]\nNow we've got the beginning of Aquarius ... uh where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of aquarium yeah and this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was\nThis woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven entire on is kind of a ... and the mentors so this brings up the idea of\nGetting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint we're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community work global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other\nA color your you're going to get the fortunate or Jupiter energy you have an asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nOr creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all on the edge of terrorists or Jupiter is going to help you with all of a sudden you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life or being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn is you know or\nYou need to be the warrior the esoteric keynote for scorpions\nWarrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sun science Scorpio comes into life having to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving um is very helpful for you over the next or\nYou know next year next Thirteen months it starts a November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane\nUm how about a\nYear going into my eighth how um yeah I see that\nYeah oh is that going to get any thinking\nWell if you don't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle to where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is\nMaking a square or right angle to its own position so what you want to avoid as nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system so when people are able to sort of meditate or study\nParticularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects than you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing\nThan good things are happening but if you sort of\nAre not on a clear path of what you're doing then if you develop a lot of anxiety and worry and stress you know you're you're going in the wrong direction you got to get back on track\nStress really does screwed people more oh I mean\nAnd here's the thing what people don't realize you know and I'm not going to say anything against eastern astrology but you know a lot of people as you may know they'll say oh you know I'm\nJeff ... personal injury attorney

from yours a bit of ... all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I I took her three through the years and I've been a lot I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and uh hopefully it's my uh it may be my swan song but I think I\nMay maybe about this subject and\nWhy do you think the government really has not just what we know\nWhy don't they tell us\nWell I think they're coming close with this latest program that with the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come but um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of\nA court case but uh I think that we have known all along\nWhere these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies with I mean\nIt's it sounds like a far out thing it's not something kill would approve of it in his heyday a matter of fact ... was reluctant put out any of the occupied reports until I wrote the boat strange effects from your life I was in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the um occupied in cases and uh and and and things like that but of course caves main focus was to get to ... hearings he managed to do it twice and sick Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has the great hopes for the University of Colorado a UFO project\nIn fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO pride project because the way you are just symptom of disarray aims of our um out of some of our best cases\nAnd I'm\nIn the long run they just\nAlmost completely ignored them\nI remember when the conduit reports chemo did kind of boot you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine now\nAnd from that time on all the funding for a night cap a went out and then a\nA a there was an not kept staff member who was also had the CIA connection and I think to say I had been trying to take it over\nA for some time of course Roscoe Helen ... who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you see to see how you wanted to do like just squash it\nWell I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call I didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon who had a\nWho had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it um which which struck me kind of\nI'm\nOff balance because ah\nActually that was the one that\nBefore I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three where to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of thoroughly over a period of several hours and\nSo I think they knew all along that uh\nYou know but they have a certain amount of control over it\nBut uh and and kill a\nI don't know I I just don't know how much kill really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was\nWilling to let my cab continue um\nAs long as they can monitor it as long as they could monitor right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine who fired you\nAre but um I think it was a joke Brian he was the CIA contact the did you like ... or the CIA member and the ... and and uh and and Colonel Brian um\nAnd also do it for an a and a a heart transplant see a connection store next and it was the the the a plant in the office had CIA connections\nAnd uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nI mean wasn't my ... independent I don't work in his Asian\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who had the authority to let you go and kill too you said\nThat's correct he who's the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that the we had a board of governors and I'm\nIn early sixty nine they appointed a key how the prize or not he was the director first they bought it and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position and uh\nUh but and by the end of that year it took less than a year for them to a closed down the er organization but I think they had been a\nA a a\nReally monitoring us all along metro we even that's we haven't caught the Airforce and won a kill an hour on the phone and I came home to live a hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't on the office that off but that often maybe once every two months or so

joined with him and creating a totally false case\nAnd then having to be a ... and so we created a case where UFO had landed but there were occupancy and there were special effects their re electro magnetic uh affects aliens walking around and they actually showed up a a and\nOne of the project Blue Book reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we publish the a
