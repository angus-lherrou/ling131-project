islands in the in the south China Sea uh they have done very similar tactics to some of our allies as the Japanese and and a Philippine navies is well\nThan welcome back to coast to coast George ... with you've got a great program for you tonight Steve ... and informative engaging speaker delivering compelling provocative programs to businesses universities diverse organizations\nHe's an independent scholar researcher futurist and the fields of energy and environmental policy as well as a former engineer and business executive with thirty plus years of experience at fortune one hundred and private companies he's the executive director of the climate science coalition of America which is an independent\nNon political association of scientists and concerned citizens focusing on informing all of us about the realities of climate science and energy economics his book outside the green box is in my hand right now Steve welcome to the program good to have you with us\nA very good night to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York wow and what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke ... moved from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nWho the man the Wolverine spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel\nClaim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred and news articles written so a\nA kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would uh and and a lot of folks there I think believe\nThat if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition\nOr there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo there are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they\nThey are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nIsrael pollution to fix that is\nCorrect but I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nAre at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting\nWhat are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things that carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for a day I'm like mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas\nAnd what I speak to groups I liked to say to them what the cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently\nSaid to him what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified\nBefore Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming and humans were causing it he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European\nCommunity signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion the the first thing is that the the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so\nThe computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little\nStorms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money mhm uh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability uh corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just a post an article on CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer\nAnd that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had\nOne degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree or yet\nAnd I think it came from the sun\nWhile I Do too but that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade we've had attempt of degree in ... in Washington for us to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work\nUm the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads but I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\nWell if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence ... and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger or the U.S government also has data on\nA droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more\nFloods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green blocks Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. each am dot ... dot com\n... the new version of the ... a a map is now will be ... in now enjoyed for ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today\n\n\n\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there\nThey are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third as climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy 'em and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been\nExaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and a\nLot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper\nBy the way for size it's a heavy blunt\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons to put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarizes some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore weeds climate change you with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nIs could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\n[noise] I tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I so I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase a phrase fossil fuels I like to use that come into the hydrocarbons instead\n... well you know one of my simple series on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that is pumped on this planet each way way down there oh yeah I'd like Lance in dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and in those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death from the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise] but they didn't\nOh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate the number\nOf of uh children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat's a drop in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological\nA sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children and they're having smaller families so all none of this was foreseen at all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years\nAnd so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd the benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and or affiliate can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years and you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in junk strength strewn all over the place\nNice where's that was this you know four new seats in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at is homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nYou know the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call\nWaste dump their we're\nUh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that\nIf I might if I might come at the government of California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right more would you recommend that people start doing person to combat the situation\n[noise] ... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then as now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling\nUm but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nIt's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these pictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming\nAll of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three as a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air\nYou got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution and so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nYou talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... ...\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a\nA Scott Morris and take over as the\nUh the new a\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out\nAnd leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords um the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices\nWhile we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years up in Ontario a premier dug for took over\nAnd within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated\nUm uh for the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credit\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we got to rate of pay revolts going on in California says\nThey want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants are electricity rates right out there right now are are fifty percent greater than any other western state in the\nIn the where the eight states ... percent\nFifty percent nobody you guys are fifty percent higher than any other state and\nJeff ... personal

are\nAre getting more nourishment\nOr they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated\nUm it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds now every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles hey barb welcome to the program good to have you with us\nI I have a few things taken passed away the again that's fine you can just\nFirst of all and there's a lot of work being done with our ... and you have a fake ... frequent guest on your head David Bloom them with alcohol and gas and ...\n... cakes with that and then secondly Oklahoma has more earthquakes in way dealing California from oil drilling fracking primarily\nAnd when I was actually that\nIs true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like well that's what I mean by the ...\nYeah well you're right indirectly it is but uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve this entire planets should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and\nAnd you know all we can do though with with these things is adapt that's what we\nThat's what we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but what with weather but not on a global scale\nI'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nTo British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nHello man that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it a George what your knowledge first than if the current ages the information age user are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect to thank you Mr Gura them I say I am\nThe Lone Ranger [laughter] I have lost most of my credibility\nOn the killer researcher but people think I'm Crazy or an idiot and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing and there's [laughter] it it it's a boom warming is a very sexy position because people feel smart and that if I just\nSex position because people feel smart and that if I just you know say my bottles or do whatever all the the planet and [laughter] I'm sure you've heard of before but now the big thing that\nI Love to bring up in this totally discredited I'd like to go on to address this or the Ninety thousand cargo ships at sea they're pumping\n[noise] [noise] Mm Sulphur into the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high so for fuel fairly for dirty fuel\nUm and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization I shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower sulfur fuel types and a lot of folks in the industry think that it's going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise]\nUm there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little or improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work out in the lord is Asian was the international maritime organization thank you that's [laughter] that's it they're they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge uh in the next several years by twenty fifty if no action is taken the increased by up to two hundred and fifty percent\nThat's a big jump the sulfur yeah\nOr possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to Bruce in Portland, Oregon Hi roots go ahead\nHigh on\nHer yard and thank you for filling in my blank spaces that I have no control over their\nHands [laughter] okay\nNo I'm Serious I'm\nBack in ... I think we ought to pay it forward um right now and if they give it some kind of a of a plan that they can make our world more free I'm\nA slant paying it forward now putting our technology in in in a place where we can bring our energy where eight o'clock in the three for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it\nAnd that might be here that if you are here donate you making our our uh dams in uh\nEagle them better and I've done that we're looking at it even even rural people out here like ... and ... is bigger than I Am can pay it forward right now I think that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have that have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law limitation of slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot

of democracy\nShe what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most\nHeartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas uh let's see the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it what do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um a price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe have higher\nOr electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now where the biggest petroleum pull the producer\nBut why should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to\nDo that during implement weather and they tend to postpone things into the summer I think\nHold on Steve we've got a break and

segment with Stephen Moore I'm Steve when you add a dense which seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] you know\nBut the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and\nUh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority [noise] ah so it's a little bit of a strange situation um\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is or something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm are they concerned about anything\n[noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and the low of too tense and if you put those on the chart those rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York he used to the Rockies say Joe go ahead\nSteve interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but a lot of\nQuestions a and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just had a and a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned that that was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people\nCould have got on the way\nThis thing so I I relate this to a\nOcean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that second question would be a political climate you know ... ... talk about the last couple of weeks twenty\nFour seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a\n... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the tourist and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh\nYou know I don't want to pick on trial is already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post\nAnd uh that my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry or was traditional and I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential this fast the waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO too if you look at Chanel ball\nThat still only buried at still active it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles from the place all these years later so uh you take New York for example you got to the point right hand them\nA this big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things there I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of them out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate the um\nThe thing you said about ... ah ah what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve if they need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants and most of the ones around the world that are relying on cooling systems and if the cooling systems fail fail like happened with the Saddam in Japan than we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved\nUm the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was\nUm satellites well you said something about governments and what's your question yeah hunter\nDuring do I I think you know ... or ... defeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of ah arguably more than half of the United states some members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as we mentioned we have we have a we now have a climate revolts if you will and Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we got is an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless wherever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and Milt a big bunch of ... in South of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue there's many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we scan and the biggest one is an ice age boy I liked this warm weather folks I Do not want to see

don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited at all I think George I think it's just common sense\nAbout the human population on this planet cannot including shot in the mind them\nGeorge we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern agriculture may have eradicated a\nYou know the ancient a bane of law and then but modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat that in Africa the human population is driving DL a pig to which they shouldn't just as in this country are\nYou know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites and\nOh so you know naturally you you couldn't not twenty million a\nGreat why shouldn't hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't mad ... it would be compatible with the er agriculture where the ... horribly wrong we have law expansion fields of corn and soybeans and we show up\nYou know I I just think it's common sense that the human population now\nCannot increase shot in the line them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nOr we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think we have sixty million bikes and at one time estimates are those days are gone there are some good news there are some good it was by the way Dr Ehrlich of once said if he was a betting man he predicted that by the year two thousand England would no longer exist\nBecause of population growth fees but one of the guys was maybe been wrong or the most time said publicly in

they're not quite sure what to make out of it uh I've had a number of people telling me that\nYou know it's not humid it's not a human hybrid either it's simply a big foot\nAnd I think the ah the relationship between something walking on two legs having two arms hands with fingers attach you know and I ... mouth ... ears\nJust makes us think more human [laughter] because of the way it's walking around in the way or the way we visualize it but um yeah I don't I don't really think it's a hybrid I think it is simply its own entity it's very odd totally unique\nAnd because of the lack of sightings or the few that have been saying and then you also have to consider George\nHow many of these things are actually being being seen and how many are being\nTold to us\nThere's a stigma

know they're at work they don't want to mention it\nI mean you know these are real problems when it comes to a ascertain ing ah evidence pertaining to the creatures you know people don't want to

disclaimer inside the cover\nAnd it was kind of a play on words but uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works over worker fiction\nAnd the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world everything about big foot is fiction for the most part when you go before\nThe the Patty film or to date after the Patty film or most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod I mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about a UFOs\nYour typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face listening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that you\nWere there was a guy who called the program years ago

have easily just shut up and walked away he didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know [noise] uh he was reporting what had happened and the fact was\nHe like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise] uh having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions and so they buried him\nA I've had a couple of encounters a where animals have been killed or said to have been killed one of them are words in self defense\nAnd uh this man felt this thing was going to kill him a ... and\nWhat are you to say about that am I say you know you're wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot him\nWell that that's correct you know if he's like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things Erica\n... we will do that and we've got a break coming up in a couple of miniature show up at uh like I said I have\nSome people uh\nWho have seen bodies a couple of guys say they shot them and as

their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf cart so they could ride around rather a stove\nEarly and they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide but um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down\nA thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a call ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught to trout and he said as soon as she kind of realize what was going on she saw a big forward looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the to trust the guy is ... and the big foot\nAnd he went oh my God what am I going to do so\nIn a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot in the big foot took them\nLooks at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most one of the most unreal stories [laughter]\nOr if I heard that I Would have discounted it are entirely however having said that I had a gentleman that was canoeing in Vermont\nAnd uh he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story while you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I always had

P. A. C. H. E. three seven nine one three\n[noise]\n[noise] and welcome back to coast to coast\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast here with William she's the author of big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when the brake on\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was poured urging and stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd ah he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping undecided the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up\nFor dinner so he had caught a few brook trout lead among the rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit will gone now\nHis first instinct was the raccoons took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happen to me fishing that connect quiet river or wherever I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow I had laying up on the side of the river or I see a raccoon stick\nIt left\nAnd right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought so a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at almost ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grab numerous fish and retract it back into the weeds and that when he saw that\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the woods that he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level his tent was shut up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make its way out with the canoe but he had said that\nHe thought it was a big ... obviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand standing out of the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly\nAnd other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up and Ninety company and was able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing show when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where we could\nGet up there to get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him\nWhen he saw the first group of British missing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe\nAnd he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act but what he was not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports Honda people describe the creature in terms of height neuro big how big\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say\nA minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a and I had a ... point he had\nYeah a lot of people say the comical shape Ted there's varieties of or a hair for coloration ranging from like a salt and pepper chew a lot of people use the term or burned or read\nA and then of course brown and black so there seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique uh it seems that you either have these kind of almost ... very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter\nOr a this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the tenth degree type of body extremely muscular or the chest you know Bolger ties you know just like a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one I'm\nA one story called the tree stand a incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who's twenty five feet\nIn the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet and this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is\nIt seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was both hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning but he had said\nHe recognized as a hunter that these our noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd that he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and gently grabbed the heel of his boo\n[laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong in this measurement nobody sits there trees stand ten feet off the ground\nI mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and it's people read I don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his book\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost all what that is I just wanted him to know that they can do that that they could sneak up on him and grab is blue\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know the name of your book big put ... in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all\nWhen we talk about terra or will we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot\nI Can't I take the stand as to\nWhat is more terrifying\nIs it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder of the road or is it more terrifying to have one flanked can you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people a\nOf the encounters or somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nThese things don't want the people to be where they are and they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they're chasing the people out\nThey want to monitor the region and so they they\nDon't want them now and I think if you push the envelope are you going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to him\n[laughter] he gave them one by telling you right now George that big foot if I see that big foot\nI'm going to get we'll like pop on a on a Kansas [laughter] you know we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a car running out of the\nWilliam does does anybody ever report Bebe big ...\nI have a I Do have an account or this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George\nI Believe that\nAside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast majority of these sightings of being hand by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal a normal but\nDid doing things are involved in things that the average person does not do their hunters that fishermen there in remote areas or the loners they're people who are getting out and going into places for peace of mind to exercise whatever the case may be and\nIn so doing they enter into this realm where these creatures seemed to be a no getting bet he does and what we were just talking about I just said\nWhat were you were talking about these creatures but do people talk about the big hello yes yes I'm\nSorry a show

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talk to about ... knocking that the people are hearing what's going on with that what's that some of them well you know\nThis is one of the things that we we see on the television a relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nOr they apparently believes that this is some type of communication are between big foot you knock they knocked back with the signaling each other in the woods\nBut this is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves the would knock\nBecause according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a a semi pro landscape photographer a and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty seven teams July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them were walking into this area\nTo take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing this for twenty five years and never considered himself to be a professional\nAt any rate there in the valley taking pictures and\nThere was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then ... el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock\nEmanates through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up on the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around\nAnd sit through a husband I see something pacing around over there on the hillside\nAnd he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside to do like show he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through the years she's got it now he sees it\nAnd he says even though it was so small in his land at the distance she was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up in the air\nFor a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up in the air I'm like you said a nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well a show then\nThey're watching this thing it stand still\nRaises its head up into the air like a howling wolf puts his hands by its side just like you or I Would do mhm\nPush our voice forward and then they hear the knock you know what I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue and get through your mouth\nYou got it George is like only like you know a thousand ...\nShow\nIt wasn't a knock at all what it was more vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with its throat it's tongue its mouth who knows you can ask them questions\nBut he said it was not a knock at all so then that was really you know interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nIs it in your opinion is is it ...\nI don't know George I\nYou know amplify aren't you\nYeah it's ... it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walk on Ford's very rarely will and they walk just standing up right it uses its arms and knock holes in them move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really\nYeah uh I mean people have encountered them are hitting all fours\nShe would look like a beer to me you should do that\n[noise] [noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is fighting the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon rides you always wanted one I got\nA he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter]\nSo uh the [laughter] ... they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd uh he was scared out of his wits but he fought through it and they went for a ride and if the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of weight to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and more land but\nHere's what happens which is really unusual they got to a point in their flight there were other people in the ... with them by the white or it wasn't like just him and his wife to probably five or six people and now they got to a point where the pilot or the balloon\nLowered the balloon over all wooded area so that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this then he lifted it back up again and they made it across the next field\nHe did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying it on and it's gone dollar but here\nIn where the big foot comes in when asked scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out of the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing\nThat kept quiet and you can't control the balloon\nThis fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking it hit the deck on all fours and took off he hid it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRace you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story in one of the books that cold along came a spider where these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you had some accounts of ah feral hog on\nThese guys were hog hunting\nAnd they were sitting in a field or coming up on dusk waiting for the harms to come down out of the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass and the grass was sporadically patch in other words there were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass\nWorking away around the field they sure\nWhat he described as a furry\nArmy homemade sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all they show it was like this dome of black for\nThey were watching this thing moving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spider wanted most quickly and stops most likely an stopped finally they catch this thing\nCoursing and opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hearts that they were looking at which was still far away\nWhen this thing came in pretty opening he hid it looked like at ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards the Hodge and as they were watching this thing it's going up and one that stood up they knew it was a big foot\nAnd this thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive on to one of the horns some type of quick movement on the ground and left the field with the hog under its all morning\nBizarre story William we're gonna come back and take promise phone calls next on coast to coast\nOf the perks of being a

books are there's actually four volumes the fifth one just came out uh they're available on Amazon and pay them back and in Kindle format\nSo you know you can have your druthers whether you're a a Kindle user or if you're like oh a paperback book which I kind of favorite myself I like to feel the pages and touched\nThe old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup let's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nThank you George George with us I mean okay and you know we can thank\nYou we have two questions first of all the scene of fraud or to make laws that were captured and killed in Pennsylvania and around a little too shattering the\nMicro this thing really looks like the real McCoy this was in Pennsylvania now and I should go team Shetland ... they're all in this one may caught up in the other big foot they have them and [noise]\nAnd the second question I as you mentioned that you knew some men that shot a big what happened after the break ... wish that why would you go down like I should have what kind of weapons or they have\nWell here's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise] uh but I have a number of historical\nAccounts one of them was quite an ... interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the\nFinal grandparents had died in which was depicted a work\nCamp in Virginia at that time uh that was set up a\nAfter Roosevelt's had established a uh the protection of the parks\nAre they they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness\nIn these newly protected um a wooded areas that were to become a national parks\nAnd they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted demand off of this caught any other men attacked it throwing a\nHand axis and grabbing guns shooting at a thing as it ran\nA out of their uh encampment\nNow but the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seems that shocked gunfire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters\nThis guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards would both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch or an answer to your second question about a big what's being shot\nOr in my account called the bullet\nThis guy was hunting and um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a ... made out of stick\nHe hid this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lent itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch bows or bows and branches formed in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting so his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change on this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing uh\nOh I'm that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill now he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now than it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the fight on it and pumped around over its head\nThinking he would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that that uh cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was\nA posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing can stop them even what what has gone fired a second round added he sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept running he fired a third\nAnd fourth round and if things kept coming at him now was closing in he squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why in name destroyed the bullet and it finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shoot this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger or this things coming at him like a bat outta hell\nHe's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he's short lying on the ground who can see that that had been wanting to do is multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it\nBut why\nThese things can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't have a movie show or in Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or a hot shot some type of solid organs shot these things can run\nAnd hunters to lose their uh Corey not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures\nIt seems like to me if you gonna take one of these things down it's kind of be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ...\nOr something much sadly then you have to take them now well I mean what are you gonna do George\nRhino R. by the way I looked at the picture of that Eighteen seventies series big foot\nOr they didn't have photo shop the news you know very very intriguing picture they got a couple of these are old hunters with the big ... ah they're holding him up\nOr he's obviously dead bloody huge huge huge huge I mean you just Google Eighteen Seventy big switch shot in Pennsylvania in the pictures will pop up\nAmazing they go look at them and I\nI have a diary accounts a I called the ... it's it's no longer than a handwritten letter that you would write the to your wife and in there\nThey're not talking about big foot or anything this isn't a a brief account of a guy in a uh his two friends that went up to Canada and on\nAnd he describes in detail the weapons they were using the bullets what they encountered what they didn't and\nAbout midway in the letter he describes how his friend and the guy became the laughing stock of the camp having reported that during the hunt a during the day is hard they encountered a hair every man running through the woods", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast
