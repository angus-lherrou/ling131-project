just off the interstate and your cabin in the woods [noise] welcome to coast to coast am I'm Richard Sayre\nAnd tonight this morning we're coming do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate\nIn depth radio news talk content [noise] last night I mentioned this news taught ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction it's more like Ninety Ninety years [noise] also last night\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears to bunkers of cycling ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able\nDoctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide Bess she would do show than more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the sands conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say ounce on October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt\nThomas ... is a writer and passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest more than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife experiment did it work\nIn it he argues it's quite possible Houdini did communicate from the grave during assailants held in January of Nineteen twenty nine he'll be here in our one to explain how the secret coated method worked\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] but do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading\nFor Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI should've out or in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes I started to talk overview um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow now part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own sort of photo psychic\nAct or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coated method that that Harry in best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words\nAnd the temp word is actually a phrase\nIn each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket political line all I Would have the last two days it's on the coastline and they these were rich and pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be\nCorrelated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight and so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's\nSay Eighteen eighty age and because she would say she's communicating doin' verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just numbers but it can you know\nConstruct words rather than just numbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but they have been doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please be quickly look easy quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry and\nThere's a link on their ... now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIs all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people are saying it's unpaid da da da da di ... ... and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look\nIn Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out an eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book\nAnd if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten were and how it used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and um it see I hear a bullet points about this at the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these were that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about\nThat the secret message with in code word to leave and the actual secret ten ... message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word\nDid not look into the book and just believed that forward with a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the say aunts\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with bass [noise]\nWell I'll pitch and on and just admit it but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions\nAnd in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in this and putting the word forgive and all capital letters\nPutting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit was surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't want to start going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got a jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com or Thomas Thomas Phillips get to the other say on\nA at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her\nA so so what happens [noise]\nUm Arthur Ford shows up and he Arthur Ford usually work through the spirit named Fletcher\nAnd Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and\nThis ability for the spirit world\nTo communicate to our physical world is a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where\nHarry would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic and ah there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this pen\nKey words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that death is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe and it really really\nTouched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends\nUm so I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big romance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had\nHe saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ...\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher just just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yeah\nYes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so Beth that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a um a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I Do remember\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says off I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code on to here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded\nA letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely\nDenies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on the west\nWell yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThere and this was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got proved\nThere's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further a muddy the water because although she has\nBeen insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way\nMy family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it\nAnd said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward the ten thousand dollar prize to how anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't who's with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened\nI retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said\nI'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation\nYou know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money\nRight so your your feelings are the best basically and she herself was an avowed to bunker for fifty years uh\nAnd so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted\nYeah look at what happened um I think the subtitle of my as safe as something like that to Mrs Houdini want to be a NATO or something like that it's not on the online version but um but anyway I think she just got tired of\nTo go or Brian broadcasting stations everywhere on your mobile phone won't you load where do you what did you learn sarcoma sixteen

would use crutches and he was in it's just incredible but yet if you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging his off it ...\nTo the parallel bars where he's exercising bonds and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R and Ben Ames turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix\nStops and you know I mean if this is talk about ironclad well I mean that's that was that was a\nWas really something else a ...\nWho want to come back that\nFar and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters with some of his wage even met children and other people with other selections and actually impact as whites to identify with people in need and suffering so it really changes what sugar\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes\nBefore we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a sort of a sudden they'll sketch of of his journey to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInstruct for the White House started as a liberal Wilson and turtle huddle house actually who Woodrow Wilson was like all colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't be they they didn't know what at the time that that was a it was it was a a style and playing and um\nThey were falling in love with this\nCommunist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was a single rate than\nIt was through at um ... house and I'm I'm FDR's connection that will let in such a secretary of the navy\nI'm a few hours can actually look in such a secretary of the navy and from their intended to use the Roosevelt man and that the political connections in New York to bump for governor and then once governor\nI'm ... was a it was a jump to the White House one and they asked them to come out of the time well uh\nIn in ... some of the things that I wanted to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he would\nLike to cooperate very well with with some of those were his ideas and now they don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and\nYou know start at the he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realized that wasn't working you flip and what you know with a socialist end of it and uh you know we're ... and you become like watching the suffering so\nRight what we will get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWould that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels even though the cooperative very sympathetic maybe they'll just by people love ah like today without whether I was I grew up in prison\nShort [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely ... he gets a free pass well\nThe thing is to guys will have to talk about when you get back\nOn it which all history repeating repeating itself with the Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible uh happening it down and well known catches it you know they felt the hell\nBut how is it fits a that no one sort of you know to a store or saying hey wait a minute our president is gonna is in a wheelchair or you can barely walk\nIs she equipped you know this is the thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nUh that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and I hope people for a time of the opposite that this was the guy if he would get really thinking or five thought processes are one if you really really really tough\nJob when he would do is easy like with the help of some one on one arm he will lift their arm and the help of a crutch or ... or something at the time\nIt would appear to be walking a couple of steps\nSo they could I guess you know buying podium these are different than the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well\nSo they they are to ward off the fact that a case anything good go eat painting insurance shopping to go public and claimed that you know I was experienced it so that was showing and for X amount of hours\nSo I mean the propaganda and all those oils we're watching anything back down you know it's just the\nMedia was smaller and easier to control obviously we didn't have other things that you know cell phones and cameras on the phones and you know they could swipe at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which is seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely did um\n... like\nThis is complicated I I'm ready to strike the choice the lemon had changed debate in which the president was going to be one in from march until January\nSo you didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or had to wait to take off for or ex\nSo this mystery thing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... the hundred days [noise] um actually I had one hundred does that change\nAll right

my guest who murdered asked ski are you know when people put out these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists\nUh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAnd Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the bank system failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad or you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring accounting me going and of course and remember remember the roaring twenties well there you go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWhere it started out starting to be able to afford luxuries in the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has this has low vision of legislation or in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people at work and it was on the government or the government paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the communists communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and the New York city or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FBI regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we can have the\nCradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing we're we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism ... I'm Sorry about that I Know where he's\nAt fault and valleys in ... of of uh of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh\nUm actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and I'm just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wind revenue act of creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief act agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage activity valley authority act securities act\nAggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act\nUm and he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I well\nI'm happy to board them with your ... [laughter] well I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was rate out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it certainly was the same basic intro he was carrying just like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies\nYou know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to um you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or to challenge him politically\nAnd that kinda Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worry you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's a single that's Europe's war was going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nA new start to put a you know implement\nThe second new deal and they start to realize that [noise] substantial portion is over or unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books page and there's this wonderful magical genie of or economics or says he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war\nThat was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were ... you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a cat us it was a cutoff because atrophy\nHow do you use the training with the enemy act or to to to gain more power\nLend lease there's music playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter]\nAgain when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy in the Senate was the same thing with the with the lend lease program he was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the access powers\nAnd he was giving them to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this is Soviet Union so that we could win and they were just running up the cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country\nAnd there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war\nDespise indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know that sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments\nAnd with the beats who rockets ... nuclear weapons all for it to the globe we'd be speaking German right now I mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many as ... and a half that that FDR new\nJapanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think after the hours probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just loved war\nHe did everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese were their oil denomination meaning they don't create enough oil to run what they have to do in their country\nSo they're getting our oil from us they were coming off a huge war with China they didn't the last thing they wanted was to go to war against us so they were trying to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate and what happened was we shut off the oil spigot to them\n\nYou heard the news you heard the sports know redone review

back I just wanted to take a moment and I mentioned that Nathan state and back in LA or technical producer he's twisting the knobs and the dials and the doodads behind the big audio born this is the last time I will be working with Nathan he is leaving coast to coast am to go to ferrier school\nA not for your school\nFerrier school what is that you ask well I actually Nathan a it turns out like his granddaddy back in Kentucky is a horse lover a horse enthusiast and Nathan is going to\nA ferry your school to learn how to care for horses who are sort of like giving a many in a petty to the uh echoing shed and and had a shoe horses which I think it's just a totally cool vocation kind of a throwback\nA I in fact I thought that job the kind of gone the out of fashion sort of like ... at the bowling alley\nWhich was a great after school job for kids back in the day before automation ...\nOr or working at the rotisserie Matt remember those anyway so Nathan is going to a shoe horses and I'm a I Love horses in one of my favorite Winston Churchill sings a church also of course he said the outside of a horse is good for the inside of a man\nOr any wait Nathan it has been a great pleasure working with you all are although we've never actually met face to face but I've always looked forward to hearing your reassuring albeit discarded voice coming through my headset or these last well nearly five years so God Bless Godspeed and good luck to Nathan state than I can work again some time\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was relatively young guy um\nBut he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I Want to tackle the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause that that can fashions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders and call me crazy so you can really go back and pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring in American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything as they get their hands on\nUm operation Pistorius' or was another notch he's firing eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nUm and they attacked Jillian targets and has a state and they were all caught and they\nLeave each one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get\nClose to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt's I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day\nPeople think oh this was Seventy some odd years Seventy five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who was accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely frustrated at the White House and we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo he'll give me an example of give me an example in in ... White House so some of the the communist and they had he's here\nFor the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth that came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there\nThere were there were hundreds of at least Fifteen higher ranking officials and left the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter white all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins was turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety\nAnd I'll talk about Harry Hopkins is a lengthy later\nSo they don't get bored on their way more common [laughter] um the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state\nThe national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions or the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you one with a laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of ah of people\nSo I mean he was just communists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state it was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery FBI couldn't travel very well\nBecause of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth and uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the um\nCPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way up north I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins in down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help the Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute\nBring the waters in America before all of this happen okay I'll get to the minute\nOr he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a KGB defector and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contracting a Soviet Union about uh the the than on a project which of course we all know as a nuclear weaponry\nSo here we have I mean there are informants inspires all around\nThe FDR so so the point where he goes to the trunk conference\nYou know I mean ... a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of or the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nSpelling writing information right he had plans in the post war world of taking America was have communist anyway he had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler\nSo it was all diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this or that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to um\nTo the directors of Hollywood a union leaders are college professors he knew the target\nAnd they were were ... invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city in the city's names escaping it ... it is are listed in my book\nIn the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was here for how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway yet had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious found that didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meeting our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil empires\nKnow in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by stone stone is the puppet master\nThe uh he's this guy would he managed to accomplish and his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party's journals used to call them comrade or was it come Conrad index card used to call him a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party one by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control\nI mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from London's will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson ticket taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who murdered FDR stay with us here in coast to coast them\n\nYou are on your schedule plus ask you one line except most transfer credits\nFor information ... now two three five five one seven\nLearned for yourself by the wall Street Journal

how gambling you kids three five ... and\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n... the author of who murdered FDR stays with is how you doing a steaming you hold on okay\nI Am I just trying to get over the story of the ... the girl bake their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to ... what's the ones that are gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin it must have really hungry\nOr\nAnybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well yeah it never ceases to amaze um I just wanted to take them anything because people need to know like what you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and a three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're are you doing OK and we appreciate you being here\nWith us and staying up late so I'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world\nAre so much in the post war world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result\nOf FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your pain forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously\nYou know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt sprint condition or and and I'm happy I really didn't know what happened he just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference and obviously he's he he looks like death warmed over seven months before\nAt the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um FDR's being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of\nToys and let's see what are you thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump\nOn us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know what was poisonous at the time so FDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away\nToo Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs\nAnd go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger\nEvery time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or\nSo you know I I did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in the tiny Marcia Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini at all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient so this is what people ask me we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just\nDied of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nAnd said you know wait a minute I really got to look into this I didn't believe that in high school whether we were taught about it back then they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] it but in the book you point out how he he doctors\nI guess Dr uh mcentire admiral navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard brew in\nThey were they had no idea what was going on when he and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless well\nAnd this is where you know this is where the rubber finally started to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and\nYou know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing and the symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician who was also the vice admiral and in a certain sort of in general the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard brewing was a commanding a navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology it with as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first time that something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would go normal and then it would\nGo it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every any wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nGot to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's got to run for president again again\nAnd we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day back or frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he was a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines after the march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out with is is a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this was a dead man walking\nAnd the what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning\nFDR as being slowly poison styling style and got him I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world after yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world\nUm the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world\nFDR didn't want to share of the world was I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWas it they died that was part of the negotiation team\nWasn't until years later who wants it they died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at ... ... ... on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain in your in\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rainy resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was pot Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe from that surround conference dies on this ship\nCerebral hemorrhage it gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also named Mac and talking to relation to the doctor Ross mcentire he dies of his cerebral hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is worth ... rat poison\nIn its powerless pays less order Lewis and its circulating over the place is a matter of fact style and got murdered was rat poison or friend come in from the internal is governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay style wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman you want it to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nA a tremendous mine and he couldn't outsmart them\nOkay so here's you know this had to happen um for style and to get his way and we he had been so infiltrated the government with everywhere everywhere as a matter of fact the fixing the plot FDR dies in front of two Russian Spies\nUm he was having his portrait painted and Elizabeth assume it's off um she was a Russian she was over here I'm with her

[laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote a the uh the book being um\nThe White House physician and that was a Ross and Ross mcentire were they in on the murder habits only new

know why would you lie to flee the scene right right\nYou know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now the law was\nThe same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty\nNo the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the ... with us so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know ... is with us but couldn't talk you know ... and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him in the open being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the

to Richard I mean take a look at 'em\nYou know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that the murder that they've lost over um Warren Harding Warren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we've talked about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published\nYou know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book I mean there's got\nTo be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here or an ... an Alabama in the wild card line any good morning welcome to coast\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some ... she was several of Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and those remind now\nI'd also like to ... that's an experience with the blood thinner prescribed for my grandmother\nWhich was referring it costs to handle things all over it looked like British conscious bleeding all in the body mind than ever and it came time to name your isn't\nThere you go but you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage\nAnd they'll also and of course I Know Dr but no my parents were both on it\nThey're both on a variety of blood thinner so\nRight my late father was as well\nSure definitely cause brooding than any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nYeah my dad had their good morning I okay as quick\nA three part of an outlet in over the ad sorry I thought I heard um\nA gentleman on the air I heard wet head top elite who also believe that ... ... like that and I'd like to know if he hadn't have in the area around it I act in\n... and what is it the grass is how he would be someone that would talk about that new the new deal as as a\nUh doing the right thing around that that that are for that show called great get prank and anti like thoughts on that and last way ... about\nBoth direction connection and job both FDR and it's a towering stable genius if you will and the White House it's changed somewhat different because\nWith the current and then they shake and they have to have more to do with leading up\nEven how he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to and can hit ... maybe I got like a lab but right on ... and and of course he I don't see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has ... ... and ...\nWell my I had if I could just jump in because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think you were being kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump but\nLet's just stick to to ask you are where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster a little bit and I've had dinner when I'm In and he waxes on about the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause it to my knowledge has never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people\nUm it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so as far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of little facetious as to how\nHow everyone is in whole history you kind of repeats itself but kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how\nWe have the [laughter] we were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country and it's really it's really something else if only Joseph Joseph McCarthy were alive you know he would he would really enjoy this I think\nRight so I think your point there making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from uh CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow I Hope it to the history of another red scare it's starting to repeat itself all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually I'm interesting book I think you'll like it thanks for less than I ever growing up\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we\nCan and here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking us into the break on coast to coast am [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd I think he would do for the story was that it would require you to ... he won that Roosevelt Web cooking to break them up for the call that the that to Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of controlling ... again by the fact that uh that's dollar one of the debt I I think he did not want to want to deliver quality pop like that's just my my take on it\nAll right interesting John ... bad shape you're going to die anyway I like All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have bone slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting that what you said has been he look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned\nSystematically poison\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four\nThis wasn't from the advance on polio and it spills out very very plainly and my book so it's it's an interesting time in history is an awful lot of people who researched this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure but um as far as style and Stalin wanted to rule the world\nHe didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he signed something to look in the ... in the end of the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being very the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he\nDied so if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of false propaganda\nI John thank you for that some interesting points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning look at the coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr ... just show banning it in your research physical or did you come across all anything about this just a ... an attempted coup against so Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it happened if you came across it how close was it a ... happening and it costs us ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler and that one of the people involved was a I think it was a guard or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come the happening\nOr if it if it did happen if there was an attempted coup\nAgainst Roosevelt\nSaid something that you discussed in the book but a is a deep\nUh James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWhere the amount of people who are round Roosevelt who\nDidn't like him for multiple reasons I'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capital is to holding off as as long as he did it would not would not surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I Would be lying if I said I thought that I knew everything\nLike James thank you for that way and he's in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to cost\nAmerican ridge or one time you cannot do your job do you have returned from nine to ...\nWow that's very kind of you to say but it's

welcome to coast to coast am I'm Richard Sayre\nAnd tonight this morning we're coming do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate\nIn depth radio news talk content [noise] last night I mentioned this news taught contends the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction it's more like Ninety Ninety years [noise] also last night or should I say\nEarlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife tonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears to bunkers of psychic ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his blood wide best he will do sell\nThan more than two years after his death his wife best it\nOh then more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the sands conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message\nPreviously agreed to by Harry and bass initially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact\nCommunicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry\nFinally after the last say ounce on October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt\nThomas ... is a writer and passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest more than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife experiment did it work\nIn it he argues it's quite possible Houdini did communicate from the grave during assailants held in January of Nineteen twenty nine he'll be here in our one to explain how the secret coated method worked\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where\nShe claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... public\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of\nThis debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own sort of photo\nPsychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coded method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words\nAnd the temp word is actually a phrase\nIn each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number ten can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reach in their pocket pulled out of ... ... what is the last two digits on the coin and they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number\nAnd so it it would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight and so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best selling her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating doing verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights wording in the secret code emitted so so he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix says right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just numbers but it can now of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend that they have\nPair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly look be quick\nAnd as you said all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I Know\nThere's a link on their ... now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered took bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIs all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people are saying it's on paid da da da da di ... crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look\nIn the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of the twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten were and how it used to form numbers\nBut not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear a bullet points about it at the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about\nThat a secret message would in code word to leave and the actual secret tempered message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask you this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word\nDid not look into the book and just believed that forward with a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the say aunts\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I Am a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWell I'll touch on that in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and hell of a a little but we are for time missing compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions\nAnd in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of hurricane Harry's mother intrude into this session and in this on putting the word forgive and all capital letters\nPutting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit we're surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHe did Thomas I going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in and got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking is going to the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the an essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com\nOr Thomas Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and\nThis ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world is a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um\nLike a show or very theatrical show where hey would work with Beth the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her a well he was very poetic with very very at times very touching and romantic and ah there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about\nThrough a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe and it really really\nTouched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted did anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends\nUm so I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that out there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's\nQuite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ...\nAnd ... and again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on that uh this is a lot of\nNonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly started that they're now denounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that\nThis was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or graphic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it read ... I Can't pronounce the name but the\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows that there's not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code and to here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBats heard about at well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said\nThat they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website\nAnd the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's there and this was written to Walter windshield de ...\nNew Kirk I'm so it's\nThere and this was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it looked like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off thing this\nLetter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has\nBeen insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this\nYou know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the ... and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to how to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\nWell that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money\nRight so your your feelings are the best basically and she herself was an avowed to bunker for fifty years and uh and so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted yeah look\n\nThey're measuring the media was new conservatives world such what we rush rush Limbaugh deliver the WTO don't you go to\nHunch in Georgia I'm Pam

was dragging his off if you do the parallel bars where he's exercising bonds and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R and Ben Ames turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops\nAnd you know I mean if this is talk about ironclad well I mean that that was what was a was really something else a ...\nWho want to come back that\nThat part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters with some of his wage and have been met children and other people with other selections and\nActually it would have liked to identify with people in need and suffering so it really changes what sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes\nBefore we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a set of a sudden they'll sketch of of his journey to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\n\nInstruct for the White House start as a liberal Wilson and turtle huddle house actually who Woodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't be they they didn't know that at the time that he was a it was it was a hostile and\nPlaying and um they were followed it all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was a Senate race than\nIt was true at um ... house and I'm I'm a few hours can actually win that game systems secretary in the navy\nFrom their intended to use ... million and that the political connections in New York to run for governor and then once\nAnd that the political connections in New York to bunch for governor\nAnd then once governor I'm ... was a\nWas a jump to the White House one and a half into from out of the time well uh in in ... some of the things that I wanted to do\n'em over want it to do but\nYou know he was a guy to cooperate very well with ... with ... or some of those were his ideas\nAnd um they don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and you know start at the you wait till he ran I catch scotch and everything and we realize that the that was working you flip and when you know with a socialist end of it and uh you know\nWith ... with the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal and the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or that had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with\nSort of ... of mind and how would that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he hit a cooperative relationship but maybe\nIt's just like you know ah [laughter] it's like today without whether it was like well up pretty\nShort [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely ... he gets a free at\nWell\nThe thing that you guys will have to talk about with you but uh it's it's it's a history repeating repeating itself it Russians and the White House and\nYou know just all kinds of things that incredible uh which happening it down and long don't catch it with you know popping up but\nHow is it that uh that no one sort of ... you don't notice store or said hey wait a minute our president is gonna is in a wheelchair or he can barely walk\nIs he equipped you know this is the thinking back then obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nUm ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and actually I Would hope people for a few hours a day that\nThis was the guy if\nHe was he can really think on four or five thought processes are one that was really really really do when he would do is ... with ... some one on one arm he will leave the room and the help of a crutch or an or something at the other one would appear to be walking\nPicket couple of steps so they could I guess you know buying podium these are different than the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well so ... or to ward off the fact that\nA cage anything good\nEat painting insurance shopping to go public and claimed that you know I was listening to it so that was a shoo in for X amount of dollars so I mean the propaganda and all those oils for Walsh anything back down you know it's just that the media was smaller and easier to control\nThat we didn't have other things that you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could get wiser at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which are seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely good\nI'm ... like this was complicated I I'm always struck\nThe toy demand and had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January so we didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or had to wait to take off for work\nSo\nIt's a mystery thing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents right where it was a hundred days um FBI Hitler hundred is it does it change\nA righty at a forum for months to a head start a listener will not take a timeout will come back Steve and talk about the new deal and the depression and communism and and much more who murdered FDR Joe Cocker hide your level way ended break on coast to coast am\n\nToday is a party a dot com K.

FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nHe certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banks system it failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad or you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring accounting me going\nAnd of course and remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe're starting out serving to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has this is explosion of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of health for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the gun route paycheck\nAnd um this was the ... experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen\nIn this country okay so all of this information or was\nComing through his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're in New York City or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FBI regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we can have the\nCradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the or the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism ...\nI'm Sorry about the noise of pitfalls and valleys in the ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh um\nActions that were enacted a in in who murdered FDR and I'm just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wind revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority ac securities act\nAggregation of gold payment clause homeowners little lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress to me\n[laughter] you just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Would love it\nI'm happy to board them with your ... [laughter] well I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that and he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it certainly was the same basic intro he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either to disagree with them or to challenge him politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six\nHe had worry you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nA new start to put a you know implement the second new deal and they start to realize that\nSubstantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid who is this wonderful magical genie of or economics or says he wasn't there was an economic failure people were uh they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWe were ... you know we're we're we're still going to get the new deal for until his death\nWhere were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a cat a it was a ... because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease is playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the St Louis is the same thing with the with the lend lease program he was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the TV access powers\nAnd he was given to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this new Soviet Union so that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's\nThere's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because you start to realize the new deal with not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point\nWhere he knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies indeed\nAnd you know we have spies too I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries having them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the beats who rockets to get rid of the nuclear weapons all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now I mean they were on the rent so we had to get\nInto this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo when the book you argue as many as ... or ... that that FDR new\nJapanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he did he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or was he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think that the hours probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just loved war\nHe did everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese were their oil debtor nation meaning they don't create enough oil to run what they have to do in their country\nSo they're getting our oil from us\nThey were coming off a huge war with China they didn't the last thing they wanted was to go to war against us so they were trying to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate and what happened was we shut up the oil spigots on which forced them to go island hopping we're already broken the Japanese communication code", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "21"}
