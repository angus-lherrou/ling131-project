they're like we're gonna we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I heard there was a monster there so I'm Wondering\nOver they're interviewing people taking photos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there any way and so I turned into investigation when I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just what it is you just can't help but he is in your mind that's what she did you you would if you weren't that'd be hanging out there with then you would just be just dying\nLiterally I can relax a little bit that despite you know despite what my friends will tell you I can relax hiking trail\nBut you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are in the wash up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak citing up there but as always up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a a like a twenty foot a metal sculpture\nThing this thing as you enter the town and the town is the populations like three or four\nOr something [laughter] I rented a car I'm like I put on the braces I gotta I I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping the biggest you know world think it's a ball of yarn or something like that I'm looking at all [laughter] that's great okay so I'm I'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science\nI Googled that downtown your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're not there of course\nThat you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this crane article for Neal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins Halloween\nSee ... I I Want a two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders as well if we and\nThey're going to come up with this conversation I'll love it might make grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that I Know I work with one of the\nThings I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but\nBut you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to his Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the the cult which is not but it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history I'm so basically Halloween\nA ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick these events and holidays there is not just one street lined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or dealing festival called ah when\n[noise] uh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice\nUm and at the time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plans are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness but it wasn't sinister by modern standards and the one we ... we think we think of\nThe darkness as being you know something faster but to them it ... it was very it was much more of an an analyst\nPoint of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons um and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes that was a time to you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day\nThat the um uh the the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why uh the the began talking about how spirits would or would come come forth on this day and it was people were were much more likely to be able to\nUh see spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous um you know the barrier between them but also\nUm in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that a time as porous and so what you find is that a ... who would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy\nSo it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that um that uh for example a woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and there would be the prophecy and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so is it ... you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would the would a light a candle in front of a mirror uh\nFor example they would be what a what a candle for a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the deal with a look at the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husband your function\n[noise] um and so all these are the example was up for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing in the ... the particular holiday tradition that if you got a piece of appeal than apple in one long continuous strip on broken\nAnd you talk to every one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do I Do it at midnight\nRight on right that's right will swing [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it is fun I see it as a\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons\nThat we would watch like which is in the goblins and\nIn a very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the traditions out of it and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here\nBut what we have is a banner Radford with us he is as an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that\nWant to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's Willis\nWe hang in there you don't know what you might here tonight [noise]\n\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nNormal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nYou know you don't see any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask I mean they may come out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin is so cool I Love it love at all\nThat you know I mean that that's one of the\n... that's really what the course these days um although your Halloween\nWas never really mainly a children's holiday and really didn't become books Don kids he go about Nineteen fifty before that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids'\nKid centered and it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to win and the the theory\nA coping which were very strict and and again for dealing with the change of season in darkness on all that um you know you have that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all the mainstay which was November first which was you know probably the next day\nWhich was an art at the church a church we have gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a halt wishy November second which building wrong for the phone purgatory and so there was this bill it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nI'm I'm a ritual which died out long before you know the church where you're writing about double like that and then you have the influence of the Catholic Church with all the ... and and again they were to read a bills and from time to do around to keep away a demon\nThe ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away or demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know could we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring\nThe land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween praying for the dead\nAnd this again the ties back into all sold day because the idea was that um that on that day ah the soul of the word purgatory you know there were there were basically trapped between heaven and hell he needs to be prayer prayed for a and so the the wealthier members of the communities\nWould basically a higher out there were ... they were subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up\nOf course that would lead or translate into uh the the the uh the public and um but the hall added a candle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they were these members go as far as to how say you know yes will prefer\nIf you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light of the the full ... to ... wants to pray for them they would say yes and then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read one that's\nBeen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're if they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating asked that came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on like this red cells and Munch on little olive oil some pepper I'm so worried about the candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it ... it was interesting 'cause it 'cause they're getting the ... it's sort of\nThe things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again that was the ... the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time\nOf the the jitters had pretty strict social roles and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would pining away and with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four teeth of the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did\nA but you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nOr you would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man's\nYou know using a mixture of this young man's project into the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house\nAsking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory and that's that's that's a little that's a little a little outlandish for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar\nOr are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple didn't I didn't say that and like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together 'cause they were there were years where you would get full science candy bars in by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that all\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you rent if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get a handful\nNow you're the only perimeter marathon learn that I Love the marathon bars but there were all and chocolate and they they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great those I I haven't heard anybody mention those in decades oh now that's\nA horrible you you got a full one you got a phone line is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and we had to go kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your students on that's when they had those nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we were there was like one house it only had homemade popcorn balls they were ... the only time we ever had on they were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like ... or they're you know thank you trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all the research the the uh the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison candy scares and the reason the yeah\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's that's there there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that\nI'm In and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody who's actually tainted these sorts of things [noise] um if it happens very rarely there there was one case of what he points to\nAnd it was a case of a man and wrong wrong cargo Brian uh who killed disowned by leasing his picture you stick with cyanide\nNineteen Seventy four oh but but but that that wasn't a stranger that wasn't a stranger attacking it that's what people remember it was it was it was an evil person intentionally harming his own\nPeople remember it was it was it was an evil person intentionally harming his own son so this was not this was not something that anybody with trying to hurt any random kids you know coming through\nJeff ... personal injury attorney aggressive experienced honest and fair

on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there\nNow are so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff now another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage there pass doing the tricks\nSome people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they deliver to cemeteries and they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street you know the ... the abandoned homes or than in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they\nOr they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you in Britain quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I just lies writing that's why I like to talk [laughter] much of\nA social life I'll just say that all men\n[laughter] I Do like your\nLet your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences of now I ... I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go well why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know it's true like\nYou know that\nNo that was that was that was one of the things that I ah when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact\nThe dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era up and up at today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know\nYour lead to Macbeth banquet so there's there's there's there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history but\nYou know typically go were or if it's typically if people if you wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you be talking to 'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody\nWould go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a you Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back to look at the the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era\nAre often upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady day Crumpet some tea and the and you know they've tried to communicate with the go and then\nYou would have the the spiritual era [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini printed research then Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Kate McGee Fox\nAnd and and they're you know their their stuff and so and then you're Harry uprising has researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the EV pie idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with ghost or through white noise and\nThrough basically you're a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day ghost wonders with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and what's real techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough or spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit because\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in ... and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house that is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer to go ... or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and changes like you know folks quick provoking quip provoking you don't know who or\nWhat you're talking to and that's what they were there with that\nYou're not doing yourself in favor of thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\nWell there there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish\nI mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself um and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone say skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe any we're you know sound as that goes and so\nFor the first thing that I Do when I go into a case\nIs try to establish a water the false viable claims that is\nWhat exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious found or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested exit repeatable right is it\nIs it the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times\nAh unfortunately a lot of the the go swimming you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and Korean TV [laughter] reality\n[laughter] you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of growth on her 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs a girl centers on TV you and not actually just\nAcross the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engaged in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you know maps or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from your midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around a little ... sort of things and then\nAnd we'll take always reading and walk around all trying to provoke us for things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it it's ... pm am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim\nThey're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to\nYou know do this sort of sexy investigating and you get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things and and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases they don't they don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample okay so for example you'll see what goes on to go into location maybe there's team of them\nAnd though you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else will go home and analyze the problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um\nParanormal that we need to know what's normal and you would ever read it gives you get\nYour walking around with him after character magnetometer whatever it is really easy to get over that six hours that they can be a normal variation that they that only happens once a week or something [noise]\nIt's just Benjamin record that we're talking till we're learning about how he is describing investigating his theories his thoughts said look we got more of that coming up stay with us from coast to coast am celebrating will is we\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's coast to coast am Connie Willis here will is a wing is what's going on right now and we are\nTalking with Benjamin Radford\nHe also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book\nIs called investigating ghosts and it's um it's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring it back on year been we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening\nAnd I want an here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is a picture I took ... you know some ... there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something and I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to say things\nSo when you do see a picture\nHow do you know what his photo shop what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing of photos\nTell us about that yeah I Know that's that's a good question I have to say that that um you know I've I've probably looked at two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people were sent me I'm\nI'm the same with the triple Garber [laughter] on the on the recipient of\nA trip recover photos [laughter] mangy dog in Texas but I have to clean up afterwards [laughter]\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion\nBut I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the ghost photos of them sent over by\nPeople who just photograph something weird and they yeah they're not lying and they're not ... not ... they're like oh they're just like hey this is weird you know can you\nCan you help me figure this out [noise] um and so you know I'd go into each case um you know trying to figure it out in to help them as best I can answer one of the things I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are if someone sent me a photograph of Kansas\nDrop what I'm doing for you after you know to Denver\n[laughter] researcher go sort of like why not [laughter] because I haven't trademark with Wayne him good about that [laughter]\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis lean and gotten rid of that [laughter]\nJust split it with me that's all I ask you\nKnow as a no but it's um\n[noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is the is I ... went when possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which is the than the courthouse ghost case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing orbit thing that the cross this is real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy ah so you know that they're probably [laughter] that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy and the court of\nCameras though the likelihood of this being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise] um but what I ended up doing was ... I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are you all this weird name of a\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talk to the deputies interviewing people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to\nFigure out what her alternative explanations right so I usually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax because it'd be a ghost is there is there something I mean so you just basically any\nAnything that is even remotely possible I Try to lift those and I tried to rank them in terms of what most likely which which things can I scientifically test which they can actually you know investigating falsify 'em and you just basically\nGo down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important\nUh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know are you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was just sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be\nI could I could be more healthy if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there\nGo back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph at the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI see cell and and I get that I get that and you know I guess that\nThat thing whatever that might be just they're like you said in it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of one of\nAll I was gonna say you're one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up at the other people see it right and so this is right\nThere is often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody\nA and actually I was sent us an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there's this sort of weird goes the image or we're just behind her to the left um you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of\n... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without\nMore information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were nearby and no one's looking into you know strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't feed at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya got ya and you know it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see where the eye and some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um they just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is\nThe way the shadow is in just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up I mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work and and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure\nSome of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of goes investigation is um is the uh you know of ...\nFor example I was I was doing a TV so called the mystery quest a while back and I was there was some goes hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and and they they brought in all this all these are the ghost thing the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know\nProbably Seventy thousand dollars over the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are and all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with were finished shooting or going back to tell us that I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of ghost or I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even\nThe the evidence doesn't seem to get any better it's all these blurry or business not and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost and said\nYeah but if that's true if you believe that that and why why did choose sprint why did you bring in Seventy thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd yesterday and I said I got to be mean here but it's like you are on one hand you're telling me that that oh well we can't really detect go through all the gear well then why do you have all this gear and he he didn't really have an answer so you know one thing to keep in mind here is that is that is that you know\nThere are

about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak signing up there but I thought it was up there I came across um up a place called lake crafts and\nUm and it's this little you know new land is it's beautiful it's just you know it just grab it and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculptor thing this thing as you enter the town and the count of the population like three or four or something [laughter]\nI rented a car I'm like I put on the break but I got a I I Can't pass\nA lake monstercom on site and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right that's right I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I\nI Googled that bone found your article that you've written 'cause you you do a lot of writing urine author of course\nBut you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but I saw this great\nArticle from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the guy you know and so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of the Halloween\nThe the ... that I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders is well if we\nAre going to come up with this conversation [laughter] all of it might make grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that [laughter] I Know you're one of\nThe things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular or you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalist gets all the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the cold which not but if if it was basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's where I really love Halloween is it's\nBasically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's where I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history I'm basically Halloween or ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folk or it could\nBe the events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic her daily festival called a sigh when\n[noise] uh and uh we don't we don't have that much of a French about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it's basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sauces\nAnd at the time when I'm\nYou know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection\nTo uh to darkness but it wasn't sinister by modern standard when we ... we think we think of the darkness [laughter] being you know something faster but to them it was very it was more carbon an analyst\nPoint of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons um and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it wasn't scary it was like yes the time\nTo you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise] um and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the the barrier between them becomes more porous um and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would or would come come forth on this day and people were much more likely to be able to ah the spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous um you know the barrier between them but also\nI'm In a leader incarnations of Halloween it was also at a time it's porous and so what you find is that a ... who would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy\nSo it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would involve the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that uh for example woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and there would be the prophecy and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\n[noise] um and so all these sorts of another one example was a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell out the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write them down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] actually I Do it at midnight right\nOn willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that ... that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it is fun I see it and uh I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think us fall whether I think an orange and black collars yeah I think I think a little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd and the theories fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the\nFun out of it in the tradition Dana that and and ah I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is Daniel Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coastal folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's will is we have and you don't know what you might hear [noise]\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get St panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great I'm In and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the damn players and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nNormal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\n... detainee creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask can we make make something out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the\nYou know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your\nHalloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty before that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to\nGo back to solve when and the the the early\nA Celtic version of it which were very antagonistic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that um but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church every week to gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things in a whole day and and again they were they're bringing a bells and sometimes those are wrong to\nKeep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transform a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know 'cause we were talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween praying for the dead\nAnd this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that um that on that day or the soul of the word purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the the wealthy members of the communities would basically a higher out there were ... they were subcontracted prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where which type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals are going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up\nOf course that would lead or translate into a [laughter] the the the uh the public and I'm looking at a candle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they were these members go out for house to house so you know yes will pray for\nIf you're a member of your family who's a who's passed on um you know with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light of the soul which wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America um the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read [laughter] that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're if they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating after I came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it now move on [laughter] on his resume sales and Munch on little olive oil salt and pepper um so where do you think candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the city's like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean of ... it was interesting because again the it's sort of\nThe things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time\nOf the the jitters had pretty strict social world and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would ah would tying away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of\nThe time who knows 'cause that's what they did a\nBut you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house in the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nOr you would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man's you know ... a mixture of this young man's project in the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you\nSure this young man's project in the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house\nAsking for a little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's ... that's a little a little outlandish for for a little too much work for these days so that's when this sort of came down to treats\nAnd even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar\nOr are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really really only a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago\nIt was great you remember the good houses together since they were there were years where you would get full science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get a handful\nNow you're the only perimeter marathon bars that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great those I I haven't heard anybody mention those in decades oh yeah that's a horrible ...\nYou got a full on you got a full one is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those anymore those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and we had to go kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your students when they had those are nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we were there was like one house at all you had homemade popcorn ball they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people and then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house\nThat there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the uh the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the yeah\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so ... when you actually look at at the cases where\nSomebody who's actually tainted these sorts of things [noise] um if it happens very rarely there there was one case of what he points to\nIt was a case of a man and wrong wrong cargo Brian uh who killed his son by leasing his picture you stick with\nCyanide Nineteen Seventy four oh um but ... but that that wasn't a stranger that wasn't a stranger tack of that that's one yeah\nYou

I'll just say that oh [laughter]\nI Do like your\nLet your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences are now I find I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would get ... why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family members somebody you know it's true what\nDo you now\nKnow that was that was that was one of the things that I ah when\nI was researching my book are investigating goes to those is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact\nThe dead I'm ranging from basically ... three uh but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know ghost hunters and all that\nAnd what you find that the the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lead to Macbeth I mean banquet so there's\nThere's there there there's no shortage will go through in literature in history but you know typically\nGo we're typically if people you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for reasons for example you'd be talking to ... your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody would\nGo into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a year the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back to look at the the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era are often upper class\nUh places and they would have you know a lady's day Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the go and then\nYou would have the spiritual era [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Medicaid Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and\nSo and then you're Harry uprising has researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with ghost through white noise and\nFruit based a broken radio that switches channels are and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day goes on her with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and what sort of techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough or even scary enough when uh you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try that\nUh you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit teachers um it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further\nAnd they hope in pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not in that these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a hunted how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer ... or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know folks quick provoking quip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there with that\nBut you're not doing yourself in your favor thereby proclaim whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean um\nYou you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n[noise] well there's a couple of things you know one of the first things you do is\nUm you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes ministry Asians myself um and as I said I I come to a more science based a somewhat skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAny we're you know found as that goes and so\nFor the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claim that is\nWhat exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious found or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and the question is can we tested repeatable right it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times\nAh unfortunately a lot of the the go hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v.\nAnd creating TV reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows that you pointed out I was a ... of them you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of go because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do it than do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs that go centers on TV you and and not actually just\nAcross the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around we'll try and provoke us and those are things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them\nAnd they try and look for anything we all look at it at three oh eight PM am you know we saw this thing and the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim\nThey're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to\nYou know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's team of them\nAnd do you know they'll take readings for three hours or six hours or whatever else and then they'll go home and analyzing the problem is that's not nearly enough time\nTo get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um\nParanormal rap normally need to know what's normal and you know whatever reading as you get\nYour walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is with reading as you get over that six hours that there could be normal variation that that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or so [noise]\nIt's just Benjamin Radford that we're talking to we're learning about how he is describing investigating guess his theory shot his book and we've got more of that coming up to stay with ... celebrating Willis we [noise]\nGod the person or more on motorcycle insurance\n\n\nCoast to coast am county Willis here will is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating\nDoes and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring it back on year then we were talking about how you investigating how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I mean here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I really don't know in a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is talk ... you know there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something and I loved that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what is the auto shop what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... might be a maybe a light reflecting off\nOr the difference between an orbit and he said gosh how the analyzing\nOf photos\nTell us about that yeah I Know that that's a good question and I have to say that that um you know I I've I've probably looked at a two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm\nI'm a same with the ... on the on the default recipient of\nOf chipper carpet photos [laughter] usually mean dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion\nBut I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the ghost photos of them sent our our ... by sincere and people who just photographed something weird and they yeah they're not lying there not a hoax and that's not trying to pull one over on me they're like hey can I pull them\nThey're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise] um and so you know I ... I go into each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can and so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this\nMyself because you are I if if someone sends me if a photograph I can just\nDrop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\n[laughter] researcher goes photos much why not [laughter] because I haven't trademark Willis lean and gotten wrong about that [laughter]\nJust split it with me that's all I ask\nYou know but it's um\nSo so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I ... went one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing orb thing that they crossed this is real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy ah so you know that they're probably [laughter] that would that make that gave him credibility right it's a deputy and the court of\nCameras so the likelihood of this being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise] um but what I ended up doing was I went to him I said the story um it was made national news and people are all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigate it and I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be um and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to\nFigure out what or alternative explanations right so I usually I make a list of\nThree four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there something I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that is even remotely possible I Try to lift those and I tried to rank them in terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test things can actually you know investigating falsify 'em and you just basically you'd\nGo down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important\nUh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image this he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be\nI could I could be more help if if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there\nGo back and tried to replicate it you know take take the paper photograph at the same place ideally at the same time a day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI see cell and I get that I get that and\nBut you know I guess that that thing whatever that might be is just there like you said in it might be people might think they know that uh\nWell I'll give you an example of one of them\nAre going to say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up at the other people see it right and so this is right\nThere is often the case of where you know\nThere's there's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody\nA and actually I was sent us an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left um what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it\nMore information but I noticed that no one else around\nIf you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking into you know strange image to their left and so that suggests that they probably didn't feed at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um\nThey just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is\nThe way the shadow is in just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up at the time I mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or\nYou know we're the same at this place was hunting for sure that you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work and and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking\nTo measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of of ghost investigation is um is\nThe uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the Mr request a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and and they they brought in all this\nAll these uh those thing the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know\nProbably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and our and all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we're on camera I mean I ... this wasn't like a gotcha moment where just hanging out with were finished shooting or going back to hotel I said I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of ghost or I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence doesn't seem to getting a better it's all these blurry or business and that and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that\n... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost and I said yeah but\nIf that's true if you believe that that and why why did choose sprint why did you bring in Seventy thousand dollars [laughter] and yesterday\nAnd I said I got to be mean here but it's like you on one hand you're telling me that that are well we can't really detect goes with all the gear well then why do you have all this gear and he he didn't really have an answer so you know one thing to keep in
