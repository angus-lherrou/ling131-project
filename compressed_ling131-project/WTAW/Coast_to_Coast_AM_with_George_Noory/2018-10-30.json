shares was having an that criticism anyway you know the ... the the retailers that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\nYou do you think they should've adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure yeah toy so that makes me crazy you know I I saw this um um yeah I bet if you follow Toys R us on in the wall Street Journal in you know it's it's actually gone now and now an Mattel as\nA hired their fourth CEO in four years fourth CEO and four years why because the CEOs that they hire can't come up with the magic sauce to a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls you know what the real problem is\nThat what you know what they say and the you know read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a ... you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent pure kids under ten now than there were ten years ago you think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it could have makes me crazy you know I was seriously if you have a twenty five percent decrease in size up your market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or\nAmazon or your ... you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was a\nAn opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd and everyone was there ... and at a shark him as their health care was there and Google is they are American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry and I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing\nFolks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation of why are you know how they think how they buy and Hilton\nSays it's it's about new products it's about making room smaller on your lobbies bigger you know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market ... you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off this was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said a\n... so you're you're sailors are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a\nHoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I should what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said what we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI take you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said do act baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nIt was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean that's what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money count money go ahead not yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from it came from people ... people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out some them what did they do what do they like where did they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs you're too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common volunteers had that you know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people\nAnd and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers\nEverybody you see that the boomers all sat there\nAnd I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down and ... and another large groups that kind of ... and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with you there what's happening to like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you're not you want to tell people should McDonald same store sales are off you know it their all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years as I said you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition [laughter] no it's it's for French fries\nGarden list of what they tried to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food\nIt's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they\nAre if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts [laughter]\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ...\nWe we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million or three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise] ah\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller you\nKnow that's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast am get\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coast noon newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n\nYeah absolutely if that does it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\nThe\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have\nA a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific\nProduct the large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that's that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well\nOkay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then the the um [noise]\nUm the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of STDs to\nA generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department said he kept on firing their their chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and\nThe fact that they can be for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age she calls herself for Cuba and young woman now uh we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born or outside of wedlock they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the\nThe uh uh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that you know whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back ... forty years\nAnd you you you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies but the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the\nIssue of sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies live became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nA superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... were there with you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have not with with the cushion in between\nA generation X we don't because they were never born we're losing a cushion yeah well\nWhat we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age\nAnd and I'm In a middle income or our\nOccupy exactly the same space so if you're middle aged small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ...\nWe're born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to do is becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for a dollar a year or you were converting these in the sales because the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\nA Facebook it's kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what you buy none and there's no way\nTo a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a\nA suburbs uh enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust\n'em a Facebook at all I I really don't\nI don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories are are sellable\nAnd and what a separate Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot that killed eleven people in the Jewish synagogue the guy who sent all these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spoke their hatred um how come we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert powers in in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whacked jobs\nAnd um I don't know that that's that's more um a more understanding of the of a of a psych uh graphics than a demographics as far as I'm concerned\nKen what's happening in the housing market both younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's going to happen\nWhile they're renting because they had a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt you know\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um\nA kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements they're throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve and and that they're starting households and getting married you know

in their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done is dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou know yeah I you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you monitor yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and ended up like that\nIt exactly George C ... and I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nMy position on ...\nThe ... and my ability to forecast what's\nNext based on demography is based on a a a very Mac world view a very thirty thousand foot view when you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight no arguing yeah kind of what's what's going to happen\nGoing forward ... it is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of either of those too so uh\nWhat what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position and said she forgot yelling at me [laughter]\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead I\nCan to question so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more information than a ... and one issue than ... people have that it you know then\nAnd how the system as a nation of explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what to emphasize in the sense that if you look at Japan\nPeople used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked at it and then the federal level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office to that in the height of whatever [noise] ah so\nMaybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question would be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized for putting out small for prior to that I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even a New York for example I got I got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I made but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] ... inside just dwelling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and give us a synopsis again Joe\nJoe\nYou know now that there's for example that explosion that video ...\nYou know like half with everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based just how\nShould people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize a because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this grant that for that the something whether it's just so\nSo much of the nation like you're like a carnival is sad or on the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your limits Romanians you're quite a lot of information that we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know\nWhere's your question on of information\nThat we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of aid that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you could ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer it\nBut so how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nI come to any kind of conclusion unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with the information in in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view\nTo the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring at I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about Congress is going to change\n[noise] we've got a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio she Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money and gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing it's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA you know and that online retail ... will exceed the tempers that word is now it's probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job they're\nUm or conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\nThat's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would\nBuy residential every day of the week yeah to sell or rent up\nYes\n[laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but either Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and a half and half of Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want a rental has got to be very\nWell you've got the company like air being beat up the rent a house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ...\nWell yeah and I I Would describe to that it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes one of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah K C direct dot com K.

they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or by a a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nWears science committed to this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah ... where does science spin it\n[noise] well I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked an awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating or just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nOr is it how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on now you tell them to tell us what that model might be\nWell the idea is that ah that I okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking\nMy one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle bean I I'm a bean physical being but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave\nMore than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place so I I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in waveform and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world and you think about that\nAh that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and that and and that's kind of how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how\nHow this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book where we experienced a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that a peculiar thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep\nGoing from one life to the next ... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's the physical form and then there's the spiritual form a that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that\nThat we don't really ever die\nAnd ... you have documented thirty for pure ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay I said I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you a hug deja vu because symbol save a lot of it so the next book\nBut you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not and another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other instances in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think children are very open\nAs a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different organizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them\nBut I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor\nOf ... or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light oh it was terrible and and how old's your son or he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out\nYeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out uh so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know in a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuvered through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was hockey and going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again and I I think that\nI think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just\nAn eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time 'cause then another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident in ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that you\nKnow that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I ... that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh\nExperience where I I uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the north end to with the island there is a way to reach spans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you can overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of\nCourse in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the exact like ... and I was running right towards the cliff\nAnd I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this\nThis light in this warm and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these other thirty three experiences you had a or any of them demonic we'll be back in the moment on coast to coast they're\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized screw mobile users just point your

about any demonic situations you've stumbled into that\n[noise] yeah unfortunately that it that is also out there in the paranormal\nThe way that it that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure these\nThings as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary I'll I'll tell you a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a a last about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down\nI was a not very successful I dropped out of school or out of out of the University of Washington living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress\nAnd a ... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across you know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across the yards and jump fences and stuff because just to you know\n'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd ah she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she her legend grew by leaps and bounds so I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candlelight in the window and I just momentarily look in there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah she had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose or she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either it it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window\nAnd she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I and I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor and I I thought this is the worst dream this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I I'm not sure how long it lasts that it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and they explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't see it happen\nAnd I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry and something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's it that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you know no it was it was it was very real very reel\nTo reel and uh nothing that it it's so I I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that they seize that opportunity\nI think you're going to I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk you know and that's when they get you and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing or are there was actually a a I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people are councilor is like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a powerful word locker which or whatever that he wasn't at the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and they got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and\nAnd uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one up and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a diva knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head then it would turned out to be a demon had\nNor did I in fashion and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of me this instructor and he had the steam analogy book\nAnd ah he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this you're doing and I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare this guy and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in and do you mean algae and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go on freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was the was the intent was good right\nIt was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the sing all of us\nI mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move and it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard uh before I joined the army and that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately said what are you doing and I said well your roommate let me in and then she says what does that and she pointed to and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she she freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot\nAnd she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there is don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be ... somewhat good\nAre these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them in that's when you can have trouble\nYou think you invite them in with the ... board\nOh I I don't play around with we'd you boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nMeat you ... you you you hear the nine eleven premonition new\nYeah uh yeah it was interesting I was a indoor folk at at the biggest naval base in the world in in Norfolk a naval station or folk with two other professors and we were um I'm

are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the owning singer I Hope no not a voting thing it was just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognizes I looked at him the vibration stopped so I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers\nBecause it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there that the the items stopped and I you know you know and I didn't have that feeling of somebody pulling me off to bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that and\nI'm going to hinge Bruce that when you went to the red light and you made it through all lives loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does\nKind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out\nYou know and and our ... you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out\nHow this the spiritual world works and it and it gives great comfort to people when I I I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do\nI I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte turns out there in in ...\nIt doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there in in ... and there are some real people that do for\nA living and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fairly being as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people but uh it it is it is real it's very real and ah they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one\nA there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nUh in in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I I ... that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd uh I there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine in a good friend and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and the things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel I I that I have to do it and I want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm gonna write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it and I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with bell you waited for is Bruce up it's just a question than just take it away to them as a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce ... wild I promised my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your mere accidents in the intersection\nAnd job comment and a question or comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam him there was some voters some dour some and and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supplied whatever my question to you\nSent you metaphorically dodged a bullet in that intersection how can the average man they average woman develop\nCultivate your oil and close personal relationship with their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is changeable with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often they light lie dormant sure\nBecause of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation I just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so\nThings kept happening but now I've I've learned to through meditation or ... when I called walking meditation all explaining I'm I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I\nI go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer a and I I I Do believe in God and I say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing or you know professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me to connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd ah and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifled but the last couple of days but uh making a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that and what I've they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm to be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be\nYou know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce ... go ahead yeah\nNo that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going back to get my degree and I said everybody has their own timeline that doesn't matter you know we're all learning\nWe sure are

BP's\nWell uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I I think that they can be very helpfully because the ... the folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location\nTo you know to give you a sign that that they're there and that they want to connect with you\nAnd I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is that they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones in pass on messages and sometimes it's very\nSometimes it's kinda sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut are often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them anymore\nAnd what do you mean by it could be said\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father\nI did a and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nA sense that is that something you'd like to share\nWith me why you feel that way and he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers\nOr wanted to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to say that the names or whatever but uh so\n... sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nWas was it emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy some times in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I I did not know relieved that and I'm hoping that if I connect with him again that maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\nAnd his ... his saying it might clear the air so to speak and maybe create a better connection and\nAnd then you know that's what I'm hoping but I I Can't force these things you know just like messages from my you know from my spirit friends they you know they want me to connect\nA and I can't force myself on their loved ones if they're not willing to hear you know the ... what the message is you have to that there's a time and place you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "30"}
