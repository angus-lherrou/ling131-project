um\nConnection with the Washington Post may have made him a useful tool for the church and his\nGreat disadvantage we're told the show he walked into the Saudi embassy as you said and never walked out supposedly was tortured and here are getting killed and cut up the pieces\nWere they bone saw all on the Saudi embassy building and it's simple and for the killers we were told were close to prince Mohammed bin Salman but where does all of this information come from and George it doesn't come from American intelligence sources\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the\nPool but he's certainly dictated most of his strips and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation\nSo he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he\nHe wanted to do his part of so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this\nUm this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected\nPretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them in did he get that from his combat o X ... ethics yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several\nTimes a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets on so [noise]\nUm it was always there was always part of his\nMakeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually a lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in that golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up and television needed writers or was\nIt was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just\nSent stuff out and stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know it shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah now with with\nRod he started before he got in the twilight zone he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people\nMay not know this but rod Serling was without question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven\nA twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out\nAnd he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic\nAll things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to ah critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into is that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writer job to address the issues of his time and every time he tried to address any\nIssue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors were getting this way and he it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction he loved fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a a television series that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art\nIt has to what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something what\nDo you think some of the issues that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils\nStemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\n... ... some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone if it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means\nSomething is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from\nPoint a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had a written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter in a Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five see\nThat's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just it's you know and and\nAt the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced you never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty the Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter] he smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it and maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what's finally did he meant you said that broad de ... do well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty other the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well\nFirst of all yeah he run Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so they do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with their buddy about the twilight zone at the ... with us his book is called rod Serling his life's work in an imagination\nAlways on your phone and you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized gr mobile users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with ... with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nHundred and ... and I know that three of them for example it's a good life in praise of long distance call where would that guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfields\n[laughter] you know they sure yet\nAnd as a matter of fact they have a little surprise for you Nicholas\nReally movies with Billy\nHey George how are you man on the line Nick there you go\nHey bill good to talk to you it's good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay you you give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you now okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on the iPad [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much really still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIt really you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and that I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it's still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the zone\nAnd we knew you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod surely around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did is you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision\nOf that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up and the next episode her so\nUsually when an executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know but it gets a little uptight though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever\nBut uh I recall quite clearly that a\nRod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around them\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was sick or I was six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe in these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon that course Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know\nIt's called me up for in praise of pet\nI went to the guy and you were you were in in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new well\nAngela car right now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing\nIn time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil six rotor and chicken and all that as Harry his weapon\nWas set yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ...\nThrow an ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise]\nMaking music to you this is the key Billy thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me you're not a treat neck that that was George so that was great\nHe was a I get rod surely for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] he may my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to write the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just\nYou know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything [noise] and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great and I I just wanted to\nCollect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually I'm dumb this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even really a complete\nA list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced or television or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had\nYou had gaps whatever but so that had never been done for the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so and then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that\nYou know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it hadn't been commercially released um I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the themes certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into in ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm probably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that\nWas remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regards called it's called noon on doomsday it was brought certainly attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until ...\nThe Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this\nReally just destroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of\nThe story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these you know it's a fear and says came into play and there have been several studies\nOf this particular show in the evolution that it's ... from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily found the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you and now\nIt's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated when he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he did mark Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um to his\n... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it\nIt throw him for it through and into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film\nTo introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document they needed a documentary they thought you know and we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the the assassination when he was\nYou know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that you've finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh the the people who asked him to do this\nI said we ... we need to spend five days [laughter] and and ... and William fruits had listened that's not going to happen we [laughter] we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't know exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different seal than the color shows that we all see nowadays you\nKnow it's well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that the remake of the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone\nIs black and white it's just it had an aspect the film north to them on the war has got to have that black and white uh\nAnd he\nDoes your dog each scratch stink or should like crazy come to dynamite for help\nAnd now the I think that that are cut out a regular dog\nIt was worth trying started really kind of start scanning\nFight is Tricia eight five nine four to one thousand gays and now the I think [noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add atrium relation one of the leading causes of syrup might not be for dealing with cardio mobile the FDA clear to personal you need to buy in just Ninety nine dollars to order the cardio dot com and you can have\nOr if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like a later in this life\nWhen he got sick was it a prolonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\nHe was fifty years old was any or something\nLike fifty a he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was it was interesting was new yeah\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they got to ... you know are we from this is Sharon played here it's like nowadays shouldn't have to say any that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then\nIt was so new that they have explained this this surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were showing 'em up he had another heart attack on the table\nGosh that was pretty much at Steve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi George or I get a little trivia but a right uh uh I live in central New York from Seventy period at Seventy five and I worked on a military base called ...\nWhich was okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons are quite a few actually been on the ... ah\nAnyway rods home woods about two or three miles from that great\nAnd a little town called ... up the road about Mao and a half or two miles\nWith a little courage office where I where I used to have a ... book and that's where rod Finn died yeah\nWhen he he had a a swimming pool built on a property there a couple of miles away right next to the debate or or it's actually an arsenal and uh I used to talk to the or\nA puppet master like one room a part of it and I could I I heard rod Serling with Iran during the day comes and once in a while and I always wish I had met him but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he ... or send it take to Los Angeles to or the or contrived in periods\nA TV program and uh\nYou know he's here already you know as I say you lived there right on Lake ... a an ... and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate ... out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him was that what else do you know about it that's cool well\nUh when his career started to think a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a word ... in a little cemetery called the inner lake and right on the lake and much loved that area\nIn its wife or when they first got married\nThey had their honeymoon there a\nOn a lake or a ... a her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they all went back there on a summer to uh\nWrite and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion for uh people hey no an area like a shoe store or whatever might be on store I mean it's kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everybody already rich really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for\nFree for people or people at the college or or local businesses that as he as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his correspond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent he ever get a letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist and you would think he responded to\nEvery single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about route certainly if\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with final phone calls with you a special guest Nick ... book of course has called rod surely in his

with we gee boards and stung\nBy I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly it takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely would you do when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that looked scary to you\nAll the time it's often um\n... the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist die I died and the story was that he killed himself\nAnd I go through there with my buddy another buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal this this world for some lawyers and\nAnd and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nIn the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission ... period nothing had been claimed\nA and years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things out of them\nUm that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my buddy won't go up and the addict I Know what's wrong with you\nThose wind there's something wrong up there\nBecause I saw something up there I saw goes up there I said come on man we're working here right it's not time for

had a cat that so I figured I'd spilled water on the lens\nAnd I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again no problem just stop and that strange addict [noise] that's where my buddy says bats what I saw very strange\nDo you find that the the older the object the more possible that it could be haunted object\nYeah I think\nThat um age has an awful lot to do with that I just because there's more chance for stories to become attached to an object\nYou know sometimes and object dies made and you know it's a table that was made back in ah George Washington's
