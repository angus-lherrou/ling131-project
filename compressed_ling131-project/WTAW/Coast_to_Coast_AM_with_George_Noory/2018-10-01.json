ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it\nBut those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness\nGoes way beyond that and we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases these uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners\nYour ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom and whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nAll week leading up to this date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night at a town that proved to the world that it's much more than just an adult Disneyland or get a way that it's a real community that pulls together when things get tough\nEffect that seemed to surprised so many of the national news people I I remember watching them or that week last year\nAnd that's sort of how it all started\nAnd I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police and they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people\nThey understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nAnd ah we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back and attorney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you\nAnd they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well we don't have any listen to seeing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are the detective\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or acumen to list their headquarters to understand what's happening\nAnd it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nSaid no we don't have any less\nSo years ago somebody said well they are just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that injured and tore list [laughter] and of course they would but as it happened\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my\nAuthors status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify Lucian of such qualifier are just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together a list I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and\nI Can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were posts have said Dave I'll sit right now\nWe will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards that every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now\nOf course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it but as you've stated in many others after you\nNobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell or if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nYou know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh\nWe're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's\nOr maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the profile points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot\nWhen you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read a report and start making piles in my office of certain things and after you hit four five six thousand\nThen things really start to delineate out one thing that's about Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set\nAnd they can't track the person down now someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years\nOur dog had about Ninety nine percent capture rate and\nProbably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week\nAnd it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest so that's a big one\nAt the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event if the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time if three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this is the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBorders in granite play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical crushed her up missing people anywhere in the world to Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but ... much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nAt that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family\nThat's when they move in\nEquipment malfunction and this that this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and\n... there was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical crushed during that I figured out why after I started putting pins in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain\nIn the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women is four to one ratio\nI any idea why why so many more men than women may be more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck at the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\n\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports\nNow find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased they're released the report most times a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years in a special agent there told me I'll never see that case\nIt's a standard missing persons case there is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see\n'em and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world it's criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against the law to go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to eliminate from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nThat these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why they want us to see it but there's this I called territorial behavior\nAnd many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust Colorado has that law as well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you really can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally\nCompletely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specifics you're the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to make it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to tell the story of what's going on to this too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have been a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer some questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on it's the people at the top tier in the government\nThat are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nBig zoo this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it\nAnd I don't understand it I Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports\nWhen a sheriff's office help on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything\nAnd so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of communications at you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\nSo twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location or called death for ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\nRound trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha ... right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him he reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went out and look for her\nHe reacted the right way he went goal he went and outlook for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually called the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that the last\nHundred and five hours of drone time a three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday\nWhen you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual dad cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance\nBut the family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns are trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and searching day and night\nWell ... I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kinda gave him this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they said that they haven't searched very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff to share if we can get many reports a search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and ... you'll understand this George is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus\nFox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up and then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office\nAnd demand that they get more assistance and more help for you and you stay there until they realized that it would be a thorn in their side so that they get you more help\nThat's kind of the reality of it it's sad but it's true\nAnd there were dogs used in this one as well\nYeah there were multiple multiple times\nIt's just so weird um you know a lot of these cases you have to come to conclusion that somebody just snatched snatch the victim just\nYou've heard the news you heard the sports know read a

Curt mostly on land a lot of them on water\nAnd as we've all learned tonight some of them in the air so bill Collins might have been on to something maybe there is something in the air because if you were these cases are pretty weird when we come back we're going to jump into some of the more recent research he's done about\nDisappearances right on the land and the first one is a is a chilling a example we'll be right back [noise]\nCyber criminals can attack your laptop tablet or smartphone without warning or they can steal your identity you may not realize it until it's too late lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of Norden security\nTo help protect your identity and devices lifelong uses proprietary technology still detect a range of threats to your identity like your personal ... for sale in the dark Web\nAnd north in security protects against online threat to the problem lifelong with Norton agents will work to ...\nNo one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor transactions at all businesses\nA new life lock the door and security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats\nOut of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know\nI'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents and I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine to Salman ... trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood and for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old\nHe's an intellect super smart kid\nThat was a a third year medical student reports come from the clock in this county sheriff and uh when he was twelve years old as a gift for his birthday he asked his parents for the book called Grey's Anatomy\nKind of tells you where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up you graduated from Albion College with the ... biology degree five data cap as soon become loud it was accepted at Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted internship to the Mayo Clinic\nIn June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of a second year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years and he traveled to Oregon to check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure\nTill the family wanted to see some wildlife mother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven on June nineteenth\nYou flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostels checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paint Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth even called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them\nSaid he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night in a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles south east to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness\nAnd I stopped people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in a little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they only used to see the load of people on the trail they never checked to see if you came out there a centrally worthless to don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers ... Stevens cart the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early well they exit the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and bothered them\nAnd they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out Rand registration on the rhetoric of the vehicle came back registering to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine at the family who still owns the car on the registration system and he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise]\n[noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and the thing that some assistance from the national guard Kenyans and search teams\nSearchers face rain and wet conditions for many other days\nBut again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing\nAnd are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was ...\nI mean disappointed in the deputies they said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything\nCadaver dogs were later put into that area never picked up ... percent\nThey uh they had a psychic approach them and the second went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back with down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens classes and that's where he died\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector\nAnd in fact he said you needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever from there and they are hoping Mercer that they are now any communications with the sheriff and years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search for was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that terrible turned her when she disappeared in her park ... left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I say this every conference and I say it on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a purse to locate her because the cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service feet and get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to satellite that someone needs help immediately to find you within eight feet the dispatch search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nOil whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but you know a search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um first\nOf all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active\nYou could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail and that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has\nAnd something very simple like this can ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your wife\nYou mentioned about the psychic that got involved in this case have you ever are employed the services of a psychic or have you ever invest the end of the case where a psychic was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um there's a remote your roof on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them\nI contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person to help you finding your husband\nShe goes she didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me\nAnd in other remote viewing cases there was one guy did a conference with a ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far as psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics own this row at a is outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down the road to introduce myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for each one of them said\nYeah yeah yeah we want to help wanted help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them the next week when I got back and I never got a response from when\nWe're talking with ... just about his newest book missing for one more on land air or water Mardi Palan a\nPioneer of the San

recording of a news report that was done based on this includes um some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\nIt's only now unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nYou're going to [noise]\nGet very little actually talking to consume did disturb me deny Caulkins on Henry negate cell

articulate recordings that McCain speaking at an event state auditor\n\nIn it it's one you said that it now to leach I really didn't believe she tells me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and ... did she says the investigation did get here on Tuesday\n[noise]\n'cause I see which borders he's like no you and certainly all areas where Medicaid which reported scene or a cell phone ... why does it will search they came up empty\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of ... have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing I've written about and pass book\nIs that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it\nWhy is the FBI sticking their noses in this unless they are interested in it for some other reason now\nLast power that they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nIn many of the cases I've written about in the past in missing four one on one of sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy man that were found and bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he was going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon\nA kayaker was on Russia like one mile south east of the last time they can that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the determination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McCabe in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men was that many times to families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death\nAnd they paid for secondary autopsy several times when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim\nAnd they were in level so high it didn't make sense so GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it they pass out\nThey realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this many of the times that these people have disappeared never have any of their friends relatives et cetera seeing the point where they disappeared\nSometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lot of times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you saying or a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf the police chew on water you would die by drowning not from GHB and you see ... it's not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by coroners across the United states it's only caught if you pay an extra amount\nTo do this much more advanced screening for drugs and so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat are recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like you're somebody else there that says stop it that's a\nThat's a that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing in his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted it now um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things unknown almost like no one gigantic bird swooping down and matching them up um\nYou know so many ... agrees is\nCalling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this are there are ... or John this YouTube say this this is I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic\nBecause I'm not giving you and your theories I'm giving you All Facts and\nThat's the way I Want people to understand is is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat there are patterns say in this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um ah that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at twenty angles including one that you're in Nevada right\nUnfortunately [laughter] yeah how did you ever heard of that\nYes yeah there was a pretty famous a plane crash up in that area or Steve I'm trying to remember the name a boss the I think it is yeah they got a lot of attention a couple of years ago\nUm yeah and that but I Know that was\nThat they did a massive search for him then and there were some some weirdness that went along with that disappearances well when they eventually found him they said it was that error et cetera but\nThey won't call it the fairness doctrine but it's still going to be coming from Roche stay alert Institute

brought up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are gonna want to talk to you a little bit to Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure a December twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty occurred on the island of moral it's an island in Scotland fifty five years old\nA Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot spit fires and the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force the hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island the mall and there was a grass airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water\nYou arrived at the hotel on December twenty if on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guest named Felicity Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with them on a flight but he told her no she had to lay out the torch as soon as you can fly inland\nSo she exits the plane places the torches out on the field and he or she sees him kicking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said and it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the lights went\nWill make a long story short gifted in return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers the search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six is about four months after the disappearance\nGives his body is down on a normal and this is an amount and it's like a normal nearer Deerfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it\nNow if you had jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nThe corners David the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia and I guess that he probably died two hours after takeoff will they examine his clothing\nAnd there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long has he been dead where was the plane and in my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain when people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die\nObviously the top of a mountain it's colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I see people trying to explain it in a way of saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nHow would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would sit here doesn't seem to\nOne of the things is I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of clothes\nAnd the person left the house and it was Seventy degrees out later that night to get down to fifty but the person left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes has gone in there and up stack in this field\nHas happened multiple times also I've had other cases where a parent's says might be be couldn't take off their clothes\nSo if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes so the cases they try to include try I Try to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away was ... kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational\nBut the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happened\nYou know in the alien abduction field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that or there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back and they're closer on backwards or\nShe was missing or um they got somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taking and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning I'm now there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found it's kind of folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower\nAnd they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they've been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not weathered there it's not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where did they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases\nWhen when the bodies in the water if the certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink ring of body fingernail things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nCorners of made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days for worthy wherever they been for all this time and that's the important for about ... finding a body especially water because\nIt shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\nIt to some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it it's sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body not the case\nIf they are found there are some pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\nWe when we first started this trip together years ago\nPeople said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it may be some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about\nWhat's come a long way and I think if you start shutting the door to early you can be really what may be obvious years later and that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know maybe a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me\nI mean I thinking where we are today versus where it was six years ago in huge difference\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm an open up the phone lines and you can ask David couple of questions yourself we'll be right back\nName the\nUm another lady um they were and that generally now became flash at certain point [noise] um yeah and they they tracked it on their own they could give it the end of\nUm you know I I don't know and it was three page on her cell phone into an excuse me one of them didn't make any sense with way off to the left or the way you park your car not either way the trail is um anyhow um\nIt's hard not even with the trail is um anyhow um and just kind of thinking you know I don't know what this could be and I was thinking maybe portals to another dimension\nUm big foot big for my the guy who was within his brother had seen big for a couple of times up in their family and I've seen a ship it's twenty five feet above me\nHe is also an underground secret naval base on their own land strange enough um it's on the back side of the mountain that Jim creek and not only can\nAnd I don't know any of it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's all kind of strange things that I might even mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like big but there's like a big place before\nWell do you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there who will get themes reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them but ... you can speak for yourself\nOr all all hit on one of those things are the cell phone hanging I wrote a about a case in Michigan\nSeveral years ago and they track this guy's phone\nOver this area and according to the kings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times in this pattern that he was supposedly tracked him\nAnd there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased\nIn an area probably where he should have been and where they were originally looking but it just like this lady said the kings didn't make any sense\nIt's probably more often than you are here and everyone kind of just left it off and says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good there's some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because and now they only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation as to how it got their\nFirst time caller rent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\nThank you very much for taking my call what's on your mind\nTo question for David said you've talked about how uh people when they have come back\nThey haven't remembered anything that happened to them so I wondered if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there's something about having their memory a race that also you've talked about the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked in the Syria that the parents that Germany if perhaps they're more common there\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race or you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids that's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that one of the claims that and is willing to those are a lot a lot of hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taking their very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking mayor or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter won't put it in the article or you know that's just the

things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and they practice it when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that the there was some kind of nanotechnology involved in any of these disappearances based on marks on the bodies that

Roger\n... is a thank you George or Mr now um I wanted a related story to Mr polite as a about a missing people are in the uh Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that uh over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and a and since the during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of happening in a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know the uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh you know a a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and uh and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because it is a wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if the minister of ... uh been aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers in ... and over there\nYou know what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you know if you wanted to try to contact and we have a\nWe have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a day I I Know he knows about the ... the story because it was a widely publicized but your son um what is the circumstances where did that happen and when\nOkay or if it happened in Bellingham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh you basically what happened a and this happened two years ago October uh he uh he had left home and a weed ...\nUh he had left home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been a\n... friction at home but he had left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently it ran out of cash and a and didn't have any money to get cash so he took up walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried calling his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his tone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere and couldn't find its way out\nAnd uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with a with a law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones are I mean they covered or that area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that\nPeriod and ah we were just show a broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it and they just basically told me that uh that they were a a\n... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that show\nWow Dodger that reason why yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David Amish brightest and she went to see what he thinks\nI I Would suggest you try that website or that okay that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave\nI'm that's a that's a rough story to to tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes you write and the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\nA thank you Roger thanks for calling in with trying to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies blind eye Joe Hi\nGeorge or I did a couple of seasonal gigs for two national parks a glacier and Dolly in Alaska and one thing I Would say a specially looking at the rally the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that ... it can take a bus\nNo real hiking trails and if he'd go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be that the hiking so\nI I Would say it and I will correlate to slip glacier\nAh they really on the play chess how treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty mile trails for like two three four miles so I I think a lot can do wrong\nUh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and cutting proceed ah that I don't know anything could happen what the wild animals that would be one thing now I don't think\nAh what's happening is some sort of Charles ... group that are looking to just five isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think\nThat people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so I I I I Would speculate that\nThat's not what ... what is happening\nUh but uh I I think what David Sanger about that national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know there are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was\nAt a one more thing on that is my ... both theory is what you said about the birds a swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I felt what is\nIt looked like something from Jurassic Park so I Do wonder if that's or a moat idea after some sort of\nPrehistoric bird that might be out there\nBut that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know they're criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who uh grow and grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but uh I appreciate that thought or we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines or we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um but I can understand how the elements can ah can sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the or we're going to go to the break the ... take us into the break and we'll be right back\n\n\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ... of area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard this story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um ... this evening or if you guys were talking about a ... you were talking about the skin Walker ranch right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that it and I point out the radio because I've read all the books I've read all the four one one books I've read the skin walk ranch book\nUh and I've been following this thing for some time for several years or\n... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of disappearances are a lot of this uh parents has happened on or near Richland and at this couldn't walk her ranch that's on a ridge like\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taken no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows whatever's somebody's on the property or on around I mean it's just me I I'm just saying to me a at in my opinion I think that you know that the skin walk ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the the phenomenon surrounding before one one\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities in it than it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do with themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have been other here but not people\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there has been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of a gouge marks on them other than ... grapes or things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do when you read a dachshund stories and things like that but that that doesn't fit\nBut as far as rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it\nA hundred percent success rate a no one ever sees sees it ah\nThat that to me is uh some good strong march there but\nThanks thanks for sharing your impressions with us and that's a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas or he has a ... he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome Georgia and ate a ticket for taking my call I wanted to remind my experience\nA issue here at a park in San Antonio which they added another ... miles up bike trail\nConnect a couple of parks and uh this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time almost literally me and my wife were using up by slowing down the trail of course I was a little ahead of her and uh we got through this one area where it got\nKind of dark even do with daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe sun shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of the dark in that area and when I stop to it when my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at us and it was like on on the stump they look more like a bird\nOut but uh you know we never do I mean it's kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall ... feet\nAnd just their name on that dumped just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she load and we kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah so when they saw was just awesome we just\nSaw it back a bit flying away for the wingspan was so large it was a\nIt was like a regular bird you know I mean we have dug send you a boost in all kinds of stuff but not in a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it between parts where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is\nAnd so I just wanted to show my started 'cause I Know we didn't record it to the top two or any ... anything\nBut why don't we didn't have no evidence is to expand the hard to believe that there could be that big and we were just two people just riding bikes than a a [noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on this animal are\nAll you saw was kind of like a maybe something glaze eyes kind of glowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark\nMaybe it's something ... eyes Tyler glowing just like if you just see a deer in the dark school war or something like that you knew staring at you but you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really tell exact details especially when there wasn't that this that and I and the first thing you know I Know what it was a sense that something was staring at me\nAnd that's why that's so it made me ...\nAnd ... when I looked at my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so I so second\nShe turned around and just try and fly away I couldn't really tell a bad like tens of arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story nothing none of us that's kinda creepy stuff reshape the specific detail that you had on that uh wow that's quite an experience or Jason in Portland, Oregon as inexperienced to share with us Asian welcome\nFlow George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter] no need your you're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had a lot of strange encounters in my life\nAnd I have a very rational go analytical brain that overrides things and so it wasn't until years later I started putting\nAll the facts together [laughter] and so the facts are\nI'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\nThat's basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time they bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road\nAnd pile up a big mountain of the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle\nDown that road again you can kinda hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the coast range and it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down this trail and I hear a motor running and coming towards me is like an ATV type the seats for people so it's a large a TV it's not a small one\nThere's two sets of identical twins are theoretically humans in hindsight I Do not think these were humans there were two\nA thirty thirty year old maybe thirty five year old male humans in the front identical twins and two girls in the back say about age ten\nThey were all and I'm getting even nervous and goose bumps describing this they were too perfect to believe I've
