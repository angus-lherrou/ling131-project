talk more about the coming up and just a second and we'll\nWe'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nClosed insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rail\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we're not competing against he extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah I'm In the ... this would all be over now the boss to be going home with a trophy\nUp at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider it was really interesting and I kind of an excuse afraid that the guest Michael deal in the science writer former professor\nAt Harvard and the guy who used to be on good morning America regularly appear on ABC shows uh he he probably could have gotten a bigger audience headed not been for that exciting\nOver the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but\nBut if they did well then\nYou know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nEnable so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this was that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if if Ross was kind\nOf Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um let people go out to grade are with your own local farm and ranch community just about seven\nMiles out of town where they participate in the coordinator\nAt ... at the core needs to gather like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on your effort they said that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they can get everything on the air or they hit that great opportunity for people that go out and really tried egg variant downtown Hartford feeling as getting our ...\nFeel like you're a cry and can point seven\nOther people go out here by to my heart a wake up one happening at the bottom line and and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to argue and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the star and the character and people get dressed up and they feel that they become wine or they may come down and\nUh now that that barrier various something here that ran that and they're trying to connect with an especially around Halloween and during the year after after our own your ally\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to uh my new position I'll be teaching it\nTo Kansas State it might my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip a hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nTheir bank robber on international yet from her and her with a\n... a great opportunity to really dive and care or a car and very much a part of the crime I'm definitely with check out the library trigger you are very bicker on your ... ah an agreement that we have a record store I got it done by a medical researcher\nAnd it isn't it that we have a director toward that it's done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and your first\nFor over twenty ... years and he were to be exact locations I've kind of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year that broke or family where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac rebels rent a house is still kind of in\nIn place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of things that I Would definitely recommend that people checked out\nAnd I'm near there for the truth and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I ... valley there are for sale are kind of on the phone and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nOr we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that people can talk to you when you go into the year for me is in uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nThat her and you will come and walk down our main stream and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your ... take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have a meeting aliens that we'd decorate our economy is actually now for Halloween\nPuts on a big festival with our police officers and things like that for the community that\nUm these they're about six but alien or not people like to take pictures with and and you'll hear the story of you know are employers in mind his name is ... and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and we have to work or we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate that let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where we're account about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the best of all I'm you know we hit close to doubling our size on average per year for Korean families here a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nAt communism UFO museum and research and are\nHurting good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Anita and if I'm if I'm driving through time and get a chance we'll say hello okay yes please thank you\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you read this great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history\nBut I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAll right uh there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just telling me that self about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month if it's in the quarter million so the massive amount of people that small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this was one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in the subject so it sort of\nYou use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize\nThat a ... that\nThere are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people selling wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still winter people being executed for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course all the things on the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that and she's with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nOn the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer\nIn American history and you've never heard of that either and coming up next our coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\n\nA. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three fine [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo uh gee nobody locker author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven Laura do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nA long ago turned its ... incident which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it it's really a mystery out of the even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two\nDozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter] oh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean\nNot a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even\nYou know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in in that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generation around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver was at the time to film village so salad felt that they have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings um\nAnd then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but with trials I mean the actual which is that live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since then it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess it and this is important in a ... this is just great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of\nMurder [laughter] they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that feeling of kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath\nUnderneath there for orange so to speak and part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around you know the identity and all these other kind of\nThing just become and and twenty eight thing\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they\nThey don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and then October thirty first um but really bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year joined the founder Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city if they'll itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um I talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the mall down kind of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freak each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras the good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October it's cold is a which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nHeld definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that they'll cuts families to him right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right booted up part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem\nKnown for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village or seen them or are there are a lot of haunted houses or where there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that much\nOh yeah there's all kinds of without Iran that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film which trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves demons\nAnd ... and ... and ghost everything we're in the trial was the big monster mass\nSee all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of dead people\nOver the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out there to make it to go\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things and all kinds of things\nAnd I've never had an experience so my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I haven't experienced my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's the what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trailer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual store co vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape prone to jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know ... kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trial all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a kind of many of our apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in town are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know scape\nAs a PR move for his next big event so now you're down there doing more of a say on busing but if you're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the failure of the city and complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the which is in the winter that this really strange position where they\nCall them some of which is a ... you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of you know\nThese quote unquote say panic which is from colonial times that never existed plus they have to deal with this kind of caricature of a witch Halloween which on all the street signs and the size of the cop cars and the fire engines that are you know present which is as monsters basically right you know\n\nThey mentioned the media with no conservatives well that's what we have before rush rush

I I just want to make it clear\nThat real life murder is not a parlor game uh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one dust whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow young men and women who had\nTheir human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies uh unforgiving it's a hell of a thing kill the demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever\nIt's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have [noise] so even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why I treat the subject of murder personally\nThe woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin to my grandmother\nAnd a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her even though I never met her she was gone years before I was born\nMy dissertation I'm at Arizona State on the line between solid crime journalism\nTwo of them on\nSo I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors\nAnd yet\nI wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and they were\nGoing to be totally cool so that so I packed\nThe book and then I got the call like four days that are always good to go like uh the book isn't something that they had an overnight me a book that I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time\nSo I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax that I Do not want to miss with the true story of the the ah the\nAmerica's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter to my daughter read daughter or my daughter she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that so I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out\nI didn't really say that and I worked out well it\nProbably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case um is very much to your credit so I I Want to start\nIf I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the bus or the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to capitalize on it I Would have been a torture to keep all we have to be going well over here\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\nOh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the Baucus wrangler along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote\nMaybe six or seven years ago called pocket of crime or a ... I did um uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an ad in the box and stronger case and published one theory about it which might be right or wrong or who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I mean I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the man from the train is a story it just it just speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once\nI said is is there any story too old to be told\nOr ... when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder\nAnd she said absolutely not she said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that it either been incorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it\nBut also it's true all the time that that there'll be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now these totally innocent\nThey write their trip while they're there for people who are actually wrongly executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train or a local person was not an ally of\nThe uh the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the ah ah but they're also nine people nine black people were\nMurdered by a Lynch mob who are when there was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the laughter we are\nStart first with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that with him was Nineteen well\nAlthough there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it's him\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois they shot the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nUm and the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nOf was murdered along with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the\nBelief was always did was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them um but and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the church of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assume that we did not find every crime that he committed with just we've found those\nUh which there were enough signature a terroristic signature ah characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about him scratching because I'm writing down\n[laughter] when that guy or a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually signed up this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so\nHow many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator demand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\nWell what Rachel I did was we put the murders and buckets are there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certainly it's him or Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and that ... percent bucket right\nAnd I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and one\nThat actually includes the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four nine people who were\nWho were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders at his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims his guy who cooks right All right so ... chicken stew of a typical\nCrime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\nNineteen century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long ... this could be a wrong answer I'm not along with the person who could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together\nThe crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight a family is murder most often a family including a young girl\nIs murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a pound too small to have a police department\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe the ax is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they actually there's a ban them at the scene of the crime\nOr handle is washed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't\nSee it all the doors are locked the or or something is jammed in the door [noise]\nAh the head off any move bodies post mortem so pleased when they broke and would find a\nA a huge blood stain in one room on them a bloody trail and the bodies in another room\nLet me let me cause you let me pause you right there and we'll be back for the rest of the similarities between these stories demand from the train your just learning about America's most elusive serial killer that you've never heard of them next coast to coast am [noise] [noise]\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime you normally heard on Sunday nights they use the hurt on the weekends up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was logging or one of the primary understood as was logging\nThe or doors or doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all the clarity of graphic patterns and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland then back to curves just\nNorth of Portland or so that that would be a a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a laugh from inside the house turn the wick way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a off the lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lap around with him as he committed murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would uh you'll put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from flying back and heading heading him as he was\nOrdering someone the or the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with weird this murder happened it's not that\nThe town that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA ... that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin who was it was in St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them ... another\nThing I've got mentioned they were all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... whether his first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he'd never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder and American history or the first or something murderer is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing gotten in secret there because it is done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um\nYou get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled them this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah any it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without ... much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called ... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you discovered about this it in terms of solving the climate a little bit later on almost don't want you don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but\nThen there's a couple of good football games [laughter] I got distracted dinner\nShow the ... but this guy he nobody it it ... the president is for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a whole new train tracks now because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight and wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nOr immigration of this type have little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were\nWere organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes that\nThere's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe er er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for it and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the insurgency of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no\nNational uh investigative a body like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true\n... what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true\nAnd that introduces is also into what are the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time I'm\n[laughter] I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective address additional system was\nJust a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how primitive the investigative process as war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to exploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the\nOf the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe or they knew that if you committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew\nThat if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they did they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and ... medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's the ... yeah and this was a ... and then ... I'll even through in another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this little bit in in a in a true crime book and he had written about this murder that happened in my family in that the the\n... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is who do it's it's not science\nLook at all these crazy things they're talking about which we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have the CSI effect with expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to them like in his own a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they were resistant to it\nWell and there was this until because they didn't grow up with it the uh uh\nWhen in Eighteen Ninety eight at the time of the bathroom transfer murder a fingerprint or on the line from a forensic standpoint uh it had been known since the ancient world that that by ... by some people that the rich patterns on your fingers were unique\n\nWould you wonder why we're so committed to the community remember we're the only locally owned media and be CEOs and we think it matters WG a W college to walk\nDown\nThe chilling sounds of a synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh I'm do Walters Fox News police releasing the radio calls in the moments of the massacre\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nLast time\nWhen the shooting stopped eleven people inside the synagogue were dead six wound it\nCan't happen during a baby naming ceremony a gun and reportedly shouting all Jews must die before opening fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood went to his ... director of the Pittsburgh department of public safety\nIt's a very horrific crime sing it's one of the worst that I've seen and I've been on some plane crashes it's it's very bad\nThis aspect die genocide is forty six year old Robert Ballard is President Trump says he should face the death penalty ...

necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive\nIt it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of sensationalism but it does it make it shouldn't make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened\n... had they had they built the you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been any had there been what had the town done to try\nTo come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town or afterwards\nThe I'm a ... well there was I don't know that there was that Congress than about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them I I'm for many years the bullets are\nAuthorities and I would say that still true today that the the chamber of commerce tribe pipes and let's go wish that both go was known for something else right right the ah ... there is a house or the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal t._v. shows\nAnd people pay to take tours of the house the um uh but if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial on\nThe um uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims\nVictims were mostly poor people most people without a without one and the more family was very well why\nThey are and the community\nUh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them or by that I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... where there is an effort to try to so it doesn't even have to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace not explains everything you know that\nThat's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his role as a matter of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell that to house right there\nUm but it still has not forgotten or many places many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remember\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you would have narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that let's go through that process Ninety victims\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train does he have a name [noise]\nNext coast to coast am this is the important [noise]\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't\nRight right well the the murder\nOf modern phenomena but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of a an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean just even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't ... last for long is it wasn't a lot of funding but Joe ... let's let's let's go down this path\nOf of the process that you used to try to actually you narrowed down to a name to a person\nI've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper are exempt brush and including going to ... registries and signing whether or not there was a particular sealer\nThat coincided with the murders in white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder so it just it it just it but you have to use him to START I mean it's a quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe um you know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing the search like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity and information about you know people are public registries during that period\n... you mentioned the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or\nThe or and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those bugs um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and racial says that she did expect to find them but I didn't the um a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him the um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nNumerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the ah ah but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would you would a\nSuspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few\nThings yeah please do to that you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally matter newly will they'll let you go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy I mean does that crime a month ago down\nSouth bored with the uh uh\nThat criminal had size six feet\nThe um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots cramps that were central to the trial or again size six feet is a very uh\nThe the so we we know that this is a small man\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did we know that we ... it was believed that he was small because\nI'm the or a ... and in other places when he swung the acts the ceiling wasn't very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nIf a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling\nBecause of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh\nUh it was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you could say clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or to basically right ... that's a pretty easy thing to see it was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed we had said that he had to be\nA well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all of the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas\nThe first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience longer the ah ah the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA pre ... girl a that was there in the first crime\nIn the first cry he always killed the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThe he always used the one side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... backs but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nIn this first crime blood side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that\nThe uh the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that this isn't him\nSilly you started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile ... longer ax murderer or ... ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who ... what do you credit for his crime was obvious who had committed it 'cause he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a cereal murders for crime he often kills people to home and he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so he killed the first family\n... is directly connected and can be tied so he killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and I would say they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the\nFirst about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is\nA ... ... the men on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller the weather that we can actually he wasn't even a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we've found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found are they the ships record in which he entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the um are are probably a man named Paul Miller\nHad entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if it was more like them there and walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh\nUh uh they they so if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found the ship within which became what came into the country\nIs the sailors gate in reference to lack of nutrition for the bullet goodness\nNo it's a if you're on a ship it it must have taken a cruise sometimes I've ever\nRead off the ship rocks from side to side and when you know you you walk from side to side for a day or two before you start walking oh interesting if you're a sailor for years and years then you never get over it you always walk inside rocks from side to side which is\nInteresting I never knew that um and so ... ... ... you never heard of some called fractal theory\nOr a villain Maria at least twenty ninth and Brian across from Lynn beach auto care\n\n[noise]\nSunrise now just hours away in the city changed forever I'm Del Walters they continue to mourn in Pittsburgh side of this nation's latest massacre forty six year old Robert Bauer is accused of opening fire inside a synagogue in that city [laughter]\n[noise]\nAt least releasing the audio from dispatched tapes late Saturday evening the shooter identified as forty six year old Robert Bauer is charged with wanting on federal charges eleven counts of murder ours is now in stable condition after being wounded in the shootout\nMeanwhile Pittsburgh is a city tried to make sense at all I'm devastated I'm hurt I'm angry and I'm really anxious about\nWho to find out who the victims are 'cause I Know a lot of people who are members of tree of life and this is just so\nHurtful Peter Gilmore speaking at a vigil Saturday Night Gilmore among the hundreds who gather to pay their respects that attack being called the worst attack on Jews in us history election day now a little more than a week away but millions of Americans have already made up their minds and voted\nIt's expected about forty percent of mid term election voters will vote early and in states that have opened voting centers of weeks before election day that figure will be even higher earning Michigan is director of the Fox news decision desk and says the trend means campaigns need to close\nEarlier and it means that the messages have to be more carefully tailored to get that out but it's it's a trend that I think we're definitely going to continue to see\nMichigan says it's unlikely early voting can build a new support for either party but it can guarantee likely voters aren't definite voters in Washington Jared ...

of the people that this man Paul Miller a could've killed starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped\nUm but what we have is we have a name and we have a

posted on Lincoln found some really good I mean we had a higher and\nWas she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nFingerprint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that to whenever a type of actually had it in the house then when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen and it was very common for people to have an ax\nNo yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah\nThis is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifty fifty Nineteen sixties and we had an accident what bile outside our house and I I chopped a lot of with with them\nOr to burn it out\nYou know my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood\nAnd and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lot of woods jumping meant for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago and the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating\nI'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal at this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest villa feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between holds the vision you wrote about and that says that the murderer always\nHas a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat well ironically berries and acts and his wife had right that's the way he describes it and and when the Tom he he's not going to be caught so\nYou know he had walked the cat in into the law and the you know he tried to get across and under the base but instead what how how the ... but he always called it given away\nThe uh uh by the way while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six a which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... or multi autos is based\nThere are a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know they uh anyway uh the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not\nTo get caught in fact many many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being hot he didn't he wasn't\nPeople are aversion to being hot either he wasn't he wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out you're basically of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even that you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on the shelf there\n... you wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for that the er so no he was he was very quite unusual extent\nYou have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there for a guy who didn't have any money the the the the chosen disciplines 'em dead you mentioned was good at Marie who's in Athens, Georgia on the coast to coast for Bill James Marie ...\nHigh ... in in um well I was calling because I I was kinda curious first of all you got out talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were investigating murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um and he was my great however many that grandfather was he was killed when an act\nAnd the best thing to his wife and maybe a son did that but it ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he was right out and I feel like I said I Hope that some field workers would be blamed for it but\nAnyway and so we were investigating that and then my brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail or telling a guy about two years ago by now so if there's a lot of it around but um but I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about\nA person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be\n[noise] he was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person if you um you know where they're from but\nI'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean here because every little detail he's saying you have now and when and\nWhere did you see that it just it seems to perfect for to be a first time is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about go out to be brought me to be a ... and uh I Wish there was something that you take it helped would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can we ... we could do it Rachel and I were to sit out\nAnd saw a series of crimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us it's because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it was just the way the crime set up the way the story set up that broke for us\nUm again to Syria but the Murray let's go to my ... in New York uh for a Bill James on coast to coast am\nYes good morning gentlemen and when the light to ah I see you on your back and its adult life as\nWell and good luck\nWith that weapon looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment and outlets then I'm over the uh well it's not to add New York it's it's over\nThe Internet [laughter] step\nFive spot is now we have that she would already cages at at hand ah people at the FBI or can fit it profile lays so I like it no\n... if you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a FBI profile of Mike Mike ... guy out much for that I'm\nAlso I like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in time to somebody in the NFL fans that got caught up including the black people who um [noise] wound up but not even got one child but get name Lynch and the last part is\nI I I you mentioned about\nThe stated that probably at this time at that time that the century [noise] that's a lot of um [noise] I Am I recently read a book by you\nKnow it ... it's called how I became white on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually tried to police besides the fact that you know they had like two hours look and say she ...\nBlack folk but stay off this plot then as basically\nCompeting gang and basically the gangs wouldn't volunteer fire department that ad can Keating spite thin and ...\nAnd I like in common that whether you know you're with a gang that came up as as that that formed in ... San outlets and over and over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions yeah I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs\nAre from New York and pretty civil war because they are I wrote about them in the book popular crime or they were in a there was a woman this gets back to pose ... there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York and I wanted to say in\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts a poll poll fictionalized as as the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime they they it really is an odd thing that there were these\nFire houses that were really just just a a house that was a sample ages of pretty unruly people uh and they they were kind of terrorizing the city I so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nThey didn't hang on I'm going to put opinion right there because we want to get back to ...\nAnd then the ... which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police news or the other questions you have a chance to answer coming up to minute Dennis and Dave please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about\nThe story of demands from the train to ... am genes [noise]\n\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to ... to watch the movie streets in New York right to Scorsese movie there's a lot of the digital stranded in there that's kinda cool though she left it because the question about what it Indiana modern police were FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI have an out and do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something different that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the uh uh John Douglass modern wellness profile or has spoken and written about Alaska\nOr one of his observations was that ah the um well he had several observations about the ... the crime that\nLined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it off the chart of how organized is this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of the burgers and who is a really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized\nBut also because he was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't\nI haven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine some of the book\nIs about innocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously MSN was accused of the crime ...\nIt was just a a he was a a a knock around me was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian who uh who ah you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit it was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years\nOr before a it became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually what work crying to\nFree him and did free and the governor of Maine eventually a graphic added a full pardon to hear my aunt based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in\nJail there are a lot of stories like that in the in the book it's a it's quite on it's a terrible side effects of what happened to\nThe New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated now relative to now but by relative to the places where these crimes occurred\nThese crimes occurred in places didn't have a place to park they are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was that they are so it's not it's not really a\nThe a governor that connected to my book\nNo fair enough but it just isn't illustration it in that movie of how those gangs type to operate within the government is the where everybody was vying for jobs even if it meant getting insights to keep them\nUm and in the end by the way I think profiling or would do indoors what you've done I think you'd think you'd be a very proud of the way in which the what I Hope\nSo it's a nice of you to say not really being I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights and there but this is the first time caller David is in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nI Am ...\nI go ahead and say I'm I'm Glad to hear you back on cause the call\nThank you yeah\nThank you um I have a couple of comments for Mr Jang you're a large and\nI think and you you um do your homework Bill James basically invented favor Mac or for baseball\nSo I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know ah I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm seal the to bring it up in in law had him for that\nBut ah yeah I I I think he needs to be ... for that matter visor you hate advisor for the Boston Red Sox now but he banker game that instead of a lack of ... and I and what is China than about\n... as far as I think you're kind of lifted the bottom of why I I'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nI Would still broader point you think I'm missing\nI think you're ...

I think the Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and it may be speech to the idea of going into a ... does connect in the sense that it was a family it was a house it was\n... and then it was it it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe was near the hat you know that was that the property that to inside\nUm any idea that it was in and out\nReally quickly and nothing was stolen which is another piece because you know that was you know why why would somebody doing to the house and killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she stood you inherent property which makes sense\nBut it did it did give me a moment to where\nI was thinking about the early to go to a dentist is in New York and coast to coast am for Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis\n... it's been a wonderful program it's a ... well thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it led to have 'em\nAnd you know I'm I'm I'm Glad you're back I listen to you for years and I I Know your way through to the problems there are a little ...

we'll talk more about the coming up and just a second and we'll\nWe'll go around the horn 'em\nTo a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America demand\nOther sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we are not competing against\nHe extended game that the Dodgers ended up

the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider\nIt was really interesting and I kind of an excuse afraid that the guest Michael Guillen that science writer former professor\nAt Harvard and the guy used to be on good morning America regularly appear on ABC shows a ... he he probably could have gotten a bigger audience headed not been for that exciting a World Series game so it's worth catching if you can because he talks a lot about\nGoogle Earth blind spot\nOver the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs\nThat according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then\nYou know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old rouse well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan April so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and it was a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this was that time of year where you get a lot of tourists who come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do it if\nIt was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\nArmor people go out to grade are with your own local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn me\nA ... ah the corn meal together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on your after they said that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they can get everything on the air and it is a great opportunity or people that go out and really tried egg variant aren't about hunter feeling as getting our ... feel like you're a\nCrack and can point seven other people go out here by to my heart\nA week at one happening at bottom rare and and it is our ten miles from Roswell Peter ... great players who are in camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the power of people getting dressed up and they feel that a become wine or they may come down and\nAh you know that that area there is something here that ran that and they're trying to connect with ... actually around Halloween and during the year after after our own July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nUh my new position I'll be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to ... go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way\nTo dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crash in Roswell where what can they do\nThey can get Robert on international yet from her and her ... and ... that great opportunity to really dive and care or a car and very much a part of the crash I'm definitely were heck out the library right there you are very bicker and you bring\nA on a different that we have a record store I got it done by a medical researcher who has been going on\nWe have a new record toward that is done by a medical researcher we've been doing research on the crash here for\nFor over twenty ... years and we were to be exactly the fans of ... of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nBy the first time last year that broke or family where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take you out to the crash site where a ... rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out\nAnd I'm near search for the trees and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened to you know something we don't know\nI I Believe there are for sale are kind of on the phone and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nOr we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the community and uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nAt that her and you will come and walk down our main street and go into the area that wind which is a great story I bring your ... take pictures stock in the rock a visitor center we have to amazing alien that we'd decorate our time is actually now for Halloween [laughter]\nPuts on a big festival with our police officers and things like that or the community that um these they're about ...\nAliens on people like to take pictures and and you'll hear the story of you know are employers him on his name is ... and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and with local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where we're at town about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the best of all I'm you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nAt a UFO museum memory her and her party good\nPretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until uh bringing our next guest next but thank you honey you know and if I'm if I'm driving through time and get a chance they'll say hello okay yes please bear thank you\nHoney the Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell\nNew Mexico uh she's in with the which Jay W Oscar the subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this was a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history\nBut I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually um any on Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month it's within the quarter million though the massive amount of people for that small city to have that its borders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in shape the subject so it should have you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that uh that that there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that federal isn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that lives but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being executed for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa she'll we'll get to that she's with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nAnd the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer\nIn American history and you've never heard of that either it's coming up next our coast to coast am this is Ian\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo uh gee nobody locker author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it it's really a mystery of the even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably\nTwo dozen different factors obviously they get Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held onto it over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know ... we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer tree the famous worlds exposition right you don't ... don't go on their way to put up signs and go it happen here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generation or around the on the actual the actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver was at the time failed village for sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was just the sight of the proceedings um\nAnd then on top of that today which city mean way more than just the victim of the trial I mean the actual which is that live there today and being the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween and sounds kind of become Halloween town as well so at the terminal which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important in a ... great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed\nAnd did they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry kind of build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that's Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know\nProbably through century that a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for arts so to speak and part of it that's less connected to the tragedy with more just around you know the identity and all these other kind of\nThing just become and and twenty eight thing\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] he is so they they don't celebrate Halloween\nDay I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happening which technically starts October first in October thirty first I'm really glad over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found but Halloween is going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um talk again hundred thousand people packed into small down kind of the city for failing the city but don't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October it's cold is a which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get an Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know that's not really something to him right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right booted up part of it is within the party\nOkay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former ... are there are a lot of haunted houses or where there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\n[laughter] oh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to find it\nAnd there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting idea of innocent victims you have monsters cause of the a fair trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and M. and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trial was the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people\nOver the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um the ghost tours their spooky places there's the other side of the executions you everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience so\nMy interest in that as more and the stories themselves you know until the day I haven't experienced my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's the what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston strain that victims happen in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical event that then I can\nReverberate and have kind of thought around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know ... kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trial all that kind of some kind of feed into that kinda cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a kind of many of our apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know\nScape as a PR move for his next big event so that he wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but they're doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how

I did um\nUh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took her in the box and stronger case and published in theory about it which may be right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I ... I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the mention the train is a story it speaks to something I I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told or when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the store you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true for all the time that there will be of the Wii somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted\nSometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do\nEven though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey write their their care while they're there for people who were actually lay executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man and the train but a local person was that you're not allowed\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh\nUh but there were also nine people nine black people who were\nMurdered by a Lynch mob\nWho are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that with him\nThe first with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that was him was Nineteen well\nAlthough there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it's him\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index but the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois maybe the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house um and\nThe mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nOf was murdered along with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of ended the sort of thing where I get it\nAnd and ... the the belief was always did was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them um but ... and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the church of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my pen scratching because I'm writing down\n[laughter] when that guy or a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually signed up this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway so how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator demand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason\nOr ... you know during this period\nWell what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and bucket right there is a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were flirting with him or Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and that ... percent bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and one that actually includes the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a law for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere\nBetween four nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAnd its murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims his guy okay that's right All right so ... chicken stew of a typical\nCrime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\nNineteen century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long ... this could be a wrong answer I'm not a long awaited person booth could be a long answer because there are a lot of things that ... them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour at midnight\nA family is murder most often a family including how young girl\nIs murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a pound too small to have a police department they live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved there killing with an act the act is found in the\nIn the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they act as a van then at the same to the crime the handlers washed her finger prime the house is locked up tight to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with blankets so that you can't\nSee it all the doors are all walk the or or something is jammed in the door [noise]\nAh the head off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find a\nA a huge blood stain in one room on them a bloody trail and the bodies in another room\nLet me let me cause you let me pause you right there and we'll be back for the rest of the similarities between these stories demand from the tree and you're just learning about America's most elusive serial killer that you've never heard of them next coast to coast am [noise] [noise]\nSomething like that they uh they uh the crime normally occurred on Sunday nights they occurred on the weekends up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary understood as was logging\nThe or doors or doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that the um\nThere's oh there are clear geographic patterns and the murders if want occurs just south of Portland the next occurs just north of Portland a so that that would be a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house turn the wick way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light take the chairman a off the lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nOr and then carry the lap around with him as he committed the murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would um put poet blankets over the head of sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe or you did that a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nOrdering someone who you are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with weird this murder happened it's not that\nThe tone that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA ... that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin it was it was in St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them ... another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... whether his first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not a\nI'm not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious crown\nYeah hit it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my\nPublisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something\nMurder is by its nature done in secret or the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is killing gun in secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um\nYou get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled them this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just kept document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah any it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called any we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this it in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but\nThen there's a couple of good football games they got distracted dinner so the ... but this\nGuy he nobody it it it it would be president does him for us to just assume that\nThere was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks now because there's a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is about killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time\nIn Eighteen Ninety eight and wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little information of this type have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve and a national wire services were\nWere organized that a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden the awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that\nEven though you you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the er er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year you would think\nThat people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for it and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the engine seat of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was new\nNational or investigative a body like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true\nWhat was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces is also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time I'm\n[laughter] I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess as war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to exploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe uh he knew that if he committed the crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered that was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... yeah and this was a ... and then ... I'll even through and another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this little bit in in a in a true crime book that he had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them dishes do each it's not science\nLook at all these crazy things they're talking about which we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have the CSI effect Minnick splitting\nThe forensics to be presented to them like it is on the TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they they were resistant to it\nWell and there was this until because they didn't grow up with it the uh uh\nWhen in Eighteen Ninety eight of the time in the bathroom transfer murder a fingerprint or on the line from a forensic standpoint uh it had been known since the ancient world that that by it have been no by some people that the rich patterns on your fingers were unique", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "28"}
