to a lot of funeral homes and sometimes as an invited guest because you could she ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the left\nHis ... she's always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the live family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects and so anything that said they can hear because they're very very\nNosy and as to what people are saying about them or\nHow they look or you know they they like to know that stuff\nAnd but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where the IRS table set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures and if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than this bureau will go over there and listen to what they're saying\nAnd it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep he said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's at her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your\nLady friend over there so so they're very interested in what goes on is very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there yeah I ...\nAt any rate I go to this this particular funeral and the man was standing at the foot of his casket and he looked at me he said you can see me\nI said I can and I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter bounds you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay\nAnd so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this\nAnd I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this\nAnd I just started to look to your grandmother gave him aside and so he said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet\nOh boy and I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was his brother going to try to do so thin or what was his wanted the collection of gun you want to just keep 'em from Sean\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago and I said\nQuaint amount to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him\nI Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he would do this or and she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and go\nDown the basement and see what your uncle doing oh sure enough that's wrong well bill was breaking open the gum cabinet\nRight on ...\nOh that's wrong what Bill was breaking up in the ...\nYeah [noise] so\nIt's it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me were money's kitten or uh I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for a wide that the husbands died right before\nTheir birthday or an anniversary and you know it's like look in this

when you're dealing with the deceased how many of the Murray and generally know that they're dead\nEvery one of them\nHow do you not come out of your body and look down in your spirit lead the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial they are not and I know there's some\nPsychic send me at the end said that they don't know they're dead but I mean you're not over then you don't how do you not know you would I Would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but that doesn't really know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen it's gonna be depressing even for some of the uh ... deceased I Would guess\nWell it's yeah it's a lot of them are set because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on what their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss\nAnything plus the fact there's proof of that because if you take pictures and you'll get or herbs and pictures\nPerfectly round circle if they can be

ball\n[laughter] well I really believe it's pretty easy\nAnd you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as\nPeople think it is I mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you're well what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go in his garage to leave or cut its grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move you know look at it this way if I said\nTo you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for you\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen Everytime she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debts yet\nNo chance that person one realize this is happening to them in to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus you never know what\nGoes around comes true that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get this done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone\nFor his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily the three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second date is Joel right\nDown the toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how to remove negative energy once that's taken off ... and anybody can remove negative energy off of somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got a bad health problem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you have blood work done\nThe doctor goes no everything is normal there's nothing wrong we can't find anything but gosh if

conjured up that way but when someone puts a crush on an individual mhm does the individual\nWhat happens to them do they feel something did they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things started going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down there too but you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that's when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head or if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and\nPeople don't realize that especially if everything was going on in their life or normal in their life and everything that's going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go cheap but Heather has shrunk luck for the last year what the heck's wrong\nWhen they start thinking about it and like I said you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it have it removed it's not hard to do you can do it\nAnd it is long and you know ... actually at the person doesn't even believe they have a curse on him and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who thought they were entitled to that job and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything she's great girl\nAnd but strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well things were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day and said papa\n... I think somebody put a crush on me and and I should Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said oh look couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being the person oh who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to hurry war off right and so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is [noise]\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know I ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the know a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person\nBecause she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but the bottom line is this who care who did it get get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get it off\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and in when go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nYou use every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force field to kind of block it and shield it\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that\nOnce the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give them that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about the ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going oh would lose you jerk don't hit the ball getting out and then they clap as he does its negative energy thrown on that personnel\nYeah ... that's one of the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players will\n... ... ...\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too is specially ballplayers\nLook at the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep\nYou away your but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly\nWhat about the dream

I was listening a earlier and I was just wanting to say um [noise] we just need to really mellow out [laughter]\n[laughter] we really do\nThere there's just so much a negativity and so much pressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of mass\nAnxiety and maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh\nUh tools like a tarot cards I Believe it or not [laughter]\nUm are very very helpful for remembering who we are and I'm letting go of all of the [noise]\nBeliefs in programming and construction soon opinions and\nA cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff\nAnd taking a deep breath and receiving um through images through pictures that come to us from a\nReally a mysterious place nobody knows the origin of the terrible courage to tell you the truth we know some things\nAbout it it ultimately the child is a mystery we know that it ate it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something a universally relevant for everyone in the ...\n[noise] how far back you know we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence or fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the accounting and\nRenaissance but no one knows who the first designer was actually and I I really like that I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from above some\nUh from above or from beyond or or below [laughter]\nBelow or within and you know I'm a union psychologist so are we then is the place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance\nUm it's not was not brought a to Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed or actually the gypsies chain quite a bit\nAfter the first ... uh started to emerge a in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe\nUm it is a deck of cards\nUm and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the terror of cards and actually if you think of the standards set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are Connor of the Cairo the terrible has an additional twenty two cards\nThat is called the major are coming and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of tarot cards you know they have they have the magician Ryan\nOld pictures card and you know full\nAnd wheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd that's your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] secret because I'm fascinated by\nI Know I Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful car the jets card as is the devil card\nAnd the tower usually ... three cards which people think are the most\nUh uncomfortable parts of the major economy but every card in the ... as a positive and negative aspect I'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really\nMoved since uh you know ... it became very a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot really was bird with the uh weight jak or the Arthur wait\n... the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of gyros that for the first time the minor are caught I which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards\nEach one of the tips or the miners are we're\nFinally illustrated with rich dynamic pictures that tell a story before\nDynamic pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the pardon the expression Trump Card\nAnd where we're going to talk about that as long you're right\nBut I'm only those had\nPictures that you could actually just look at directly and get an impression of ... and kind of it's just kind of sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um

hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I went oh huh and I said\nA couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being the person oh who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop spending negative energy to her a war off ... so my\nQuestion is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is [noise]\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person\nBelieve you me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose\nA woman gets angry at somebody women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but\nThe bottom line is there who care who did it get get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get it all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and in when go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nYou use every buddy susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force field to kind of block it and she'll ...\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the cruises removed that doesn't necessarily stop\nForever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses stages automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about the ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's the game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going over leaves you jerk don't hit the ball get an out and then they clap as he does\nIts negative energy thrown\nOn that person oh yeah absolutely and\nThat's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers and the slump bloodshed yeah Julie\nGood a
