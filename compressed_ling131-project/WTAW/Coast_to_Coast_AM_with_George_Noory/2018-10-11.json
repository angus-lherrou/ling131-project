of that we have five thousand products to deal with over nine hundred different diseases and ah it's just that we run into this all over the world and it's just a very gratifying able to help so many people\nDoctors story that I had a couple of weeks ago that I saved knowing you were going to be on was and you've talked about this but eating foods like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nBut it's an absolute fact or you know it might basis for my postdoctoral fellowship in the sixties and seventies and did twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand of them change over four hundred and fifty four species of animals and three thousand humans are looking for a a common thread were animals were getting the same\nUm diseases and down from the same pollutants because everybody knew the earth is going to end until he's from pollution as him and when he found was of course that there were a note from a pollution um but but I did find\nThat when people ate one serving a day with a male or female they one serving a day of any\nClasses neat things like Delhi slices sandwich meat sauce and bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni dirt armies bam trees kind of things um increase their risk many different types of cancers at the same rate\nAs smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and publish it Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me\nWell in two thousand Fifteen\nThe world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago that they study in England where they ... they looked at like five hundred thousand people who are paying these processed meats and sure enough you know men get cancer\nYeah that's true you know Israel of women and of course it also had um a cause and effect in a lung cancer and colorectal cancer and stomach cancer and so on\nAbsolute fact and so I haven't eaten process needs for fifty years\nDr I've got a friend of mine who has been a\nJust starting the regimen a ... a little late and let me tell you why she went to the doctor or a couple of months ago and they diagnosed her with the uterine cancer okay are you there I guess they're going to give her a fool\nMost are with the uterine cancer okay All right there I guess we're going to give her full hysterectomy she's all upset but ... ... what do you do at this stage\nOkay has it metastasized another word has left the uterus and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that kind of thing I don't think so\nOkay well I'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer\nChemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but also kills normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died when they can and chemotherapy treatment for cancer or the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late in his so sorry that we weren't able to stop the cancer but invariably\nIt was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that killed the patient is not the cancer and so that's a problematic thing with a trading with chemotherapy but it's everybody's choice where they're going to get that are now I ... the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend when you have any type of cancer any type of cancer\nAnd so there's uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer brain cancer I mean we could we could have saved\nJohn McCain if he had come to us okay ah he had a brain cancer\nOther that actually caused by a deficiency of a single mineral and I'm\nA ... and Phil but they gave him chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nIn in ... is it okay to do both\nWell many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would God Forbid I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases um but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do if I had my doubts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have probably probably two dozen antioxidant product that would take 'em all but um there's two of them\nAre one of which was a big study I'm and I'm a Charlotte North Carolina\nI'm In the medical school and it was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was a government study and um it's it's on our mosque a dime grape seed extract has a liquid uh from our um nature's Pearl division\nAnd it's probably shouldn't street journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective\nUm cancer which I say survival\nUh uh products and so liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight and um there's nothing like it out there and that so they they were just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar government study medical school\nIn Charlotte North Carolina published in the medical journals it's her liquid extract\nOf of from the market and grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have a caller is the radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan on the radical it or has the a few Clayton which is an extract from red green algae\nThat they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this red green algae as part of their sushi stuff as part of their standard diet\nAnd so we have a product called the radical and ... the the capsules and the radical the liquid and so I take that and of course\nI'd take the mosquitoes and grape seed capsules and they take the mosquito and grape seed liquid just for prevention\nI keep my immune system a top and I don't eat the processed meats and um
