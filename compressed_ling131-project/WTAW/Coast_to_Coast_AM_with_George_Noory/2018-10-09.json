multiple IPO's\nByron is uniquely suited to comment on the effect of technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world to moral and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid presentations on the future of work in life\nAnd here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that\nThe world of robots is going to take over the planet take take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other comes to my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk\nAnd it is a record it's all the answers and very very few jobs actually could have robots take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not\nA so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what the what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either\nVery different things that may have nothing in common so they either me either a what'd you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three arena or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's creative they can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart or by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy\nOr just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like the ...\nCancer or something like that can be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lips so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world um\nYou know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right you\nWrite run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and ah if you if you get a low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you\nDon't um and and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are a had the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance in it so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even the Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is at a point where\nIt could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of build up still abstract profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to abuse this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about balmy something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\nWell\nIt is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can't find you know\nFederal this paper that addressed that topic uh an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot

better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about it I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way you guys just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is\nUm the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's it's one losing zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off or at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for the official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this there's this rumor\nOr that's full of these books so there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese ... but people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to the library at the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sin sin to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since ... perfect and so the question is does\nThe library and understand Chinese those are those the library and understand Chinese did too to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow they'll librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determine ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what it's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not\nOr by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people\nOther people say if they can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt it is just mind boggling and it's getting even been or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers through this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power\nEvery couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those you know you have all this data coming enemies faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it if you think about it\nThe Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars and well a million new businesses it up into I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes every body smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think reason will they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question or even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion uh\nThere there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a ... device that I talked to and I\nInterrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student had kids in Japan there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned\nBenefit solved bunch of short people kids without a poor person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kid said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that that's robotic that uh the raising children on the ... and you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices does that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had that car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being\nAll right so a ... to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about the human being and and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without\nA second thought what that is suddenly had they not being attacked on people now the question can they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel want a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nUh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that suit shaping or sentient now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claim that they did that could just be in a way of program running that you know the the the program reasons that it can\nCan achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think emotions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they started doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nA little like Hal from two thousand once the sun\nRight I mean look\nIf it ever happened or we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet\nYou know smart ovens just carnival alone and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um would be able\nTo inflict harm the the the interesting and and so you kind of have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one of two scenarios either through countless programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all\nUm or tend to machine somehow develop\nGoals of its own that are different than ours and her perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um\nThey're open questions I mean right right now though\nIt doesn't feel like you know I ... I remember when the calculator you know how to calculators a kid and that was great now I have not a smart phone I don't it doesn't feel like that so long some progression of something that will eventually have the will of its own and and I and I want to inflict harm on\nAnd I I Am a suicide rural and I thought I was something I\nDon't know exactly but even that's the same thing it's just that is just the machine and and we would have never said well what if you're a slide rule turns on you\nWould you wonder why we're so committed to the community remember we're the only locally owned media NBC us and we think it matters WG a W [noise]\nPreparing for Michael ...

called him tell the story\nAnd she says huh just want to hear the other half of your story and I said sure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you call this one I had found in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go reach for the phone but I was paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said I imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today she's like yeah you would and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson gift\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I feel I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you the pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your pitch mhm are you aiming at something or does it just how\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it was an ad and all burned out yet [noise] and um I've learned was\nThat smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see their shapes either form\nIt without the smoke they were up there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWith amazing gift you still with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is the ghost photographer in our second hour we will open up the phone lines will\nSign up for go soon free email newsletter you'd have to be close to ... dot com [noise]\nOh\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMan welcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer I Love the subtitle of course is interesting Julie where you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world and\nMake believe it's coming true isn't it [noise]\nMake bullies [laughter] it's coming true was\n... it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get in these photographs and looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of make believe I sit isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make\nBelieve and then at night\nYou comes true it comes to [laughter] have you ever gone\nTo the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did when our time's yeah you know when we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to because some of the things I encountered um are are strange in summer scary and you know I found at times um\nAnd and this is where the Claire ... really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel\nUm if there is a ... a bad entity and evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks to understand um and that is if you if if we find themselves\nWhere they have a ghost in their house or they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge\nThey are in charge because it's the fear\nThat they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed and here we have\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominance like dominance like you you can get rid of the stuff I'm like that\nAnd that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes and I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma upgrade upbringing I was raised Episcopalian and so I knew the Lord's Prayer\nHadn't used for really long time um\nAnd does it work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying I'd like I'd start seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I spammer there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ... I mean we all are tell you the tree\nWhile I was gonna say do you think everybody has the capability to you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to tap into\n[noise] I have a friend\nThat is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen from the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different\nYou know perhaps I have you know\nSo few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media a big way Mm you Google ... when you were experiencing this how come\n\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right into your kind of becomes your reality you want to see he ... a you want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how common are uncommon\nCynically the photograph the answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of eased my nerves and then\nAnd then of course I turned to movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch and\nDid you do you haven't seen the which I have not seen you haven't\nSeen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the Salem witch trial and\nI'm\nJay ... who is the kind of a friend of mine is the producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets\nFrom back in the day and there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nSo they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he was like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod\nTo find them to know and and I'm like\nOh my gosh that's been happening to me so it's weird how things happen without instruction I think that's a really interesting part about all of this is that all this stuff started happening to me and there was no instruction book\nYou know I was able to identify were ghost were I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans um protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou in the ... with your mom map mhm where's well it was just like the old ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this\nWhen we could be medical\n... it could be could be people have woken up\nAnd realized that he should leave because they can't lose ... syndrome then you realize you know you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the old ... ... basically paralyzed\nYeah what I've heard what I read about and well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you don't mind the whole ...\nI I I'm I rented her on Facebook and I read her book I think Rudy is tremendous an expert on she\nAbsolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right um\nHe had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on that man\nModeled Freddie Krueger based on that man because it\nCame to him that's right and nightmares right do it was interesting with Alex\nIs um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans crystal therapist\nSo I boy you're still a big way now when I started to yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George let's do it just take a few pictures that goes I mean go all the way\n[laughter] no fun to\nWrite and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened\nAnd I learned about the stone called black troubling and black term lane is a really powerful rock it is not the prettiest rock and the crust booking them but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter um it's been studied by the juries\nAlso by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians and those just like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex is it how to put this on your night stand\nI said I have a feeling that it has a enough of a range to it that will protect you while you sleep\n\nAnd it did it sure would\nIt helped him to where the only time he had another experiences when he left his rock at home and then I started using it for friends that had kids that had night terrors those kids haven't had night tear sense had another friend sleep paralysis gave her the same thing\nWe're by your ...\n\nIf you got data services in Oshkosh than you got us on your smartphone launching loaded
