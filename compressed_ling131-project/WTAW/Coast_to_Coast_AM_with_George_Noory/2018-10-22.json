seller of the book but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago\nTo discuss his first book the hoopla project was a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend David spent two years among the ... tribe\nTo hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out of course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations are missing people he's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject\nIt traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records\nThat name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight but the big guy himself has been around much longer than that these stories go way way back centuries along with related stories Wildman and giants and we're happy\nTo welcome day back to the program to talk about his original investigation and where it's led that's coming up momentarily webmaster lax and I have pulled together our usual assortment of items and oddities\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys was introduced me and they'd say hey you can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started\nAnd uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that ... miles away who someone coming into town I certainly think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans\nAnd I found a diamond unbelievable look an individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained\nFor the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met and right away we just quick like brothers and when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery\nAnd drop the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal big foot\nWhere he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nOr you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps and the big world right\nOh bingo ah when I started\nThe most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar\n[laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and\nThey will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause but since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches Harvey myself in Harvey wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sent in stunned disbelief because\nWe were sent in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah there were huge out I had hair all over the body there was a human quality that you just couldn't mess\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the owners they would consistently say this is another tribe of people is on animals is their people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least and coexistence right\nYeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe a and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area\nThis is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe only thing about the ... areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through Hooper from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seen eating at a lot but\nIt's just an odd coincidence\nYou or I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said yeah we were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah\nA PHD name Melba catch them\nDr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what they showed was that the bypass it went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side\nTo the Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised yet\nAs the paper was written by before I get there so they write as they are in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples sell us tell a story that's phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jumped into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease hearing noon and night night I mean big what Cal civil air tickets into the break\n\nMe\nNo known names\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in\nThey went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nNow people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Mel but did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's going to like to UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes the cake their passion to different levels\nUm to the point of fraudulent um material um and\nAh will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence\n... at a minimum um\nPeople were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid\nBut it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part that I can say is it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender bank and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times\nAnd tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that say a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipe some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online\nAnd see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit ... she's a genius scientists that figured this out um it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got down to a rolling under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that eat this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n...\n... let's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles or from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious in in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight now did you how did you find all these\nSo ... ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed emit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else now the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada\nThree and hungry ... three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana live in New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but again it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with uh\nRickles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of big foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything goes you know what this map of because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same location since the ...\n[laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking were these giants the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more\nGiants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I'd asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... and shown to you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find a\nLot of these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em\nBut the the more likely candidate where all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn ...

uh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived a\nBug factly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings wall that's Bruce that could be lifted Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter] Bruce Mac it'd be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big blood or sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of a meter and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the the descriptions obviously I you have to take him in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like they could somehow it's kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's a similarity um some of the descriptions I mean I wouldn't have to leave their way here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing\nWhich suggests to me maybe they were humans may be ...\nOr just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans maybe read they really were literally wild men out there\nAnd usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen maybe they think there'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared\nYou know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's a famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact we're there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw Bigfoot\nAnd they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds and when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars\nAnd they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey you know there's this association between us and them and there are different kinds of tribe and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hard don't like it\nThe UFO diehards uh like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are in the wake you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where a there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them and that's all I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad\nAnd he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely melt\nAnd goes [laughter] I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around it back on the horse or get back on my ATV and leave and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got their so called\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big ... a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take dear Sarah they're an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods\nHunting themselves they'll come across it you're stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here by native guy couldn't have done it and\nThey don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's so tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes down\nAnd\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like with and then I hadn't heard that one you have an answer if he has his own and my question is\nEasy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people ah hasn't worked real well and you can't use a drone international park it's against the law and there's a huge trying so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big like can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running\nAnd it went all the way through the community and you could hear it it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it in October garbage cans you had alarms going off and the police officers chased it ah I think they've they've found some tracks it led to\nA there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared\nOr they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself I'm I should call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where\nThese two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it and it through infrared you can see the the bowl of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel and through this tunnel this\nCreature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm\nFeature lists dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body\nIt's just stands up and then starts moving up towards skin Walker ridge where these guys are watching it\nAnd they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by a scientist by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and uh has seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program how you doing All right so in your mind so\nSo I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph stealing sniff the ones you talked to keen on his saddle um he thought they put\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five\nHe was on his way to another child or go cross late and he was in the ... the prophet and he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as the as a tall a figure that was taller than a saddle\nAnd ah it jumps to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I Am I'm there I'm Kirsten longer here and there and I my goals will basically he she wanted to make men misery or that destroyed their souls you brought that up I just thought\nIt morally culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two story really Seamus that story than just chilies this too is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Wesley Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and that then lay Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one\nAnd I came came to read the doors of the temple\nAnd I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priesthood to cast came out and somebody he wants his hand and they just crashed a cashier and king [noise] and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate the kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do take it it's a big foot he said he can he does he have any idea what's going on because people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a ... everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics\nDave or to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type encounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was with natural ... but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nOf Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that they joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him\nAnd he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things I've always stated that\nI've always stated that I'm a manner of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern\nThat points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow\nAnd I should point out that you know you did address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for regarding people off as far as you\nWell know killing them I I think I'm going okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a a prospect that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kind of how it came it came to pass\nI remember that story no yeah that is a good one is it there are some other accounts in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person\nThrough the forest and ring a bell yeah they are\nSo low but there's a story out of Wyoming that I I don't put much credence in it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who were poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm that appear dead\nSo these people never came forward I don't know who they are destroyed was given to me but from another big foot researcher that it's a well well known and this guy was called supposedly by these two guys and then he told me\nTo third hand down the line I Would say might be true might not but there's no evidence that it is\n\nThey won't call it the ... to be coming to rush stay alert and stay tuned Russia ...

anything I have read in the last five years\nThat affected me as profoundly as what we're about to discuss you know I saw a review of this book months ago I knew we had to check it out and it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rubbing the writing is to do\nThe research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours it for anyone who is not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Robert jaws character went delivered a moving powerful slightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark

were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on this eight foot journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as\nThe victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle but instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan projects including President Truman decided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb\nLittle boy which would later ... to head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport these days you know both components of the bombs she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed onto spending an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those things the from Guam for the Philippines and on my street west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or stays in the middle of the Philippines the on July thirty is Nineteen forty five minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called ISIS the ace bandage by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she might have actually fired exposed for he does\nIt Indianapolis with two of them the first one almost completely blew the Dow off the ship Indianapolis is heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her and it shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve and it it was very very quick about three hundred men went down with the ship of\nA little under nine hundred and made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to the rest and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've bought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis she was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights and four days in the water and only three hundred and sixty minutes devised\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and they continue to sort of continued over after they drop it off\nOr what did you share with us the secrecy uh I ... which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that\nHeld secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days and you know first of which being how messages where transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there\nWas the level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled and so\nYou know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indiana Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing I'm so when she didn't show up\nThey didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was\nProtocol that noncombatants ship the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive tenet thought well I guess I don't have to report that either and so\nHe took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then beyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines see reporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that\nWell none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the coach have been broken and we were using that and so yeah\nHe should not have been there without an escort he should have you know had and\nTaking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should have had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had any\nHarm or ability yeah armor to an\nArm or I mean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor with exceptionally thin compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she thinks so quickly uh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy of the mission and why she was out there and why this information was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat and it\nTold me this was a difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories and wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nI think a big part of it they mention is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell\nThe accurate story however hard and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters of the book obviously didn't survives your piecing them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a he's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on Indianapolis story because really man uh before I get asked and not as it is to you know\nCircle back and\nThe men who marry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army named Robert and army major named Robert for men and who has spent the last couple of years after the war renting down all of the material that they shared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb\nOr on the continent of Europe\nThough one that messing with me and then burn and various components of little boy attending an island\nUm that is the final grading gather in Europe and and the conflict and so in writing the whole book we try to pull back that rather than bringing in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hide from out of rehab and for the call and tell me ... ...\nAnd what we tried to do or where to begin to recognize it even the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing one of them\nWill tell you what ... I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break we'll come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes they\nThere's\nReally against her to call at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors at radar and more technology that Marines because that means that marine didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and said he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of it is rather that demand\nThe war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his rather says commanders go down to sell the grave for lack of technology they're carrying had a wife he has three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun\nUm we were also able in an interview his granddaughter a and get even more information about his later life have before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean do you took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court Marshall per capita McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of health things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to uh the moments right after these torpedoes swam a decided the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out of\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there still is described those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yeah\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for how she amount obey the clouds just part in the movie came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nGiven the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see you know the ... the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ship sinking in twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the shift is starting to tilt first to\nThe star bird and then it goes down by the bell so\nMen are being trapped inside\nThe ship unable to his state from their\nCompartment and you know Lincoln mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship and even further this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after the ship was torpedoed all the way until you know\nMen went down with her and were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side\nThey would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side\nWell the majority of the men went off that side\nAnd there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them you know a fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away\nAnd then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead Taylor and put it on them\nI mean this was incredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board and right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there are just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nLieutenant a red vain actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very thick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting there\nAt this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer I'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel\nSo no one's been really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nThat and there wasn't you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there is incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly soap dish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned the current they knew that about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that we'd be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled some days it's it's clear his glasses on the day to rescue but Sunday's there these twelve twelve along with these current so over time over the course of the five nights and four days\nAnd then become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm One of their rescue pilot later wrote\nThat from altitude I read the plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair\nScene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they\nWere invisible and you mentioned acts of heroism active cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm a captain park he was the commander of the marine detachment that was aboard the ship and the largest swimmer group and the water's tea they did at their mentioned\nThe men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men and kept in park within that group and he really than\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep the men together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets was a single line\nI'd their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets was a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and kept in park would uh\nHelp them in that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times and he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day the succumb to hallucinations\nAnd and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all going to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nAnd men are even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse\nThere was also the uh in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and they're with hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm\nHearing these stories you've been without the injuries and the terrible burns and the the fact they have no water supplies they're out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after ... days they're just going crazy and then\nYou know you have to deal with the sharks that's the that's the terror that most of us know about because of the movie\nAnd apparently that is not exaggerated the mud not by much

to really repair the damage\nAnd also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nBut I'm In later interviews Sarah ... found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that had in part had been kept in the day\nAnd he was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain and built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him\nYou know but he did what\nI was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know\nKind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter explaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty\nAnd you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a group of survivors and kept the McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because\nYou know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from family you didn't really been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how was he received a when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen\nSince Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal so they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named the city Indianapolis, Indiana and kept in the day was dreading it that when he got there\nThey actually um travelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives\nUm travelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just have a deep plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines and\nWhen captain make they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs someone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to cheer and the ... and ... came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were feeding him so warmly\nAnd that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSarah talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records or share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past that and if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so we tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist\nAnd so interestingly enough you know a a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and said fifty three men his\n... his grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I'm trying to remember is titled he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd those final moments but what was happening in the water because in the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed and so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed and the events leading up to that so\nThis new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place\nNot only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the the wife immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine how awful that was not only for the men themselves that for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die and their exposure and their injuries um so I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara\nYes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony and then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nActually participated in a parade\nAnd then a very quickly they went home uh caught buses and trains back to their hometowns kinda them immediately got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy um\nYou know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those he could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in ... years and years and years I'm Sam for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about the the robber Jon character in jaws you know you've got that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and um\nIt's very moving scene that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in the book a zero did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know\nOne of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from ... so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way\nAnd interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home several accounts came home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this scene\nAnd only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about you know so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nWhen ... you know apple is is the book when we come back we'll open up the phone lines and maybe uh maybe you've got some questions or comments recalls we'll be right back [laughter]\n\nHe\n\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for them [laughter] of and so you know gaining my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe ... group which was the vessel that\nRecently responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts and they were the first one to be successful and what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next three hours of\nCalling the survivors up and being able to share with them\nThe news that they're shipped had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime or\nWhat [laughter] mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nOn winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they uh you know were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get this story told what about reaction to the book Simpsons come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny it ten or twenty sixteen and we said while through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending the\nReal work at the heart that you've done\nTo try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and and get the entire history and draw new analysis that very thing that happened in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history in heritage and and saying hey sir\nHey admiral what do you think\nOh boy were were you nervous about that that\nHe really really has endorsed the story and I went to his full court since he saw which is what we came up with well\nI Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great a movie um a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but ah west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California as a personal connection to this story high jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... to rescue Shavers and the water\nAnd I still have one ... you can shoot short you know and I never saw my father ... years ago but I never saw him cry and do you try to talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he a wiki on the USS that peace will take the oil or the path that you know the name of this shit that's a male I\nDon't know I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone and I was thinking about that before I call not yeah what was the name of the ship the kidney ship was the first one who knew him and he was talk ... ...\nYou know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talk about in the about\nEgypt all the all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just it just part of the ethos of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was World War two and Korea uh he was a gun or drink donors may first class you know but he ... he was a police optional ... or ... or ... years ago there was an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the bass it was an interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same he's he didn't really know what he was getting into and and he needed it\nAt that had been found could probably buy a submarine that they didn't know what exactly had happened and there was um a sailor who spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and so the cat in ... he tried to get everybody out of there said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene\nHe said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad both had been on that ship\nThanks Jerry appreciated wildcard line running used in the morning on good\nMorning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil Jay ... he was twenty six years old he was the end soon doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess she just you know of all of his memory was\nAnd I found unbelievable and eye witness account a letter\nOf the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's dated August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this\nTo read this is talk about the sharks it talks about the fact that the polls these guys up kicking the sharks off the rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the of view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been at some of the reunions but never did talk about this\nIs the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical I Would love to get a share this with a young ladies and if I can get them getting information and\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and done a A R R gal there will get the information for yet will pass it on to win and Sarah and a thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself things you are so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nI don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think they can arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um how how these men reacted to in keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside\nI don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe it wasn't um what how the er I I don't know I think ah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now that uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it and then I think it has to do with the\nThe um ... the media that we have today and they'd be able to share everything instantly all the time and that wasn't the case back then\nEast of the Rockies Joe in Long Island Morning Joe\nYeah Hi I'm Wondering uh you know that initial parade that you spoke of a ... a bitter sweet or ... or melancholy a given you know how the\n... you know so many of their comrades did not make it and I'm One cent coping strategy deliberate or just they arrived at that when you when you did interview the people and most of them really adjusted and talk about it much afterwards was that kind of
