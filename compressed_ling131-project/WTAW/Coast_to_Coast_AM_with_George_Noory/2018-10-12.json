is that I mean I don't I don't know what else are you and they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nSeems like we're at the point where either we should just build this thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really has time for us to make that they said well\nWe were very fortunate that we did not lose the astronaut and the ... not really have to literally Thanks Mike Mike bearer his website is name Mike bearer B. A. R. A. dot com\nWell a story that's been all around the planet over the last several days is seems to be getting even worse now the Turkish government\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a tree well what did the indicators market the last two days since really taking it on the Jim what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten thirty or\nBonds shoot up I'm\nRather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do\nIn China may be cheating and a lot of ways by China's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um and and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty I'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred or not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I've had this kind of limp rally for years and it's been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty\nThat that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it and it did that in the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates\nWas the first whack these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been using the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve is going to do they're going to raise interest rates that what they do\nIf the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no\nThis was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what have you read in a couple more days of downturns tomorrow if we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\nYes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year\nWe're just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year market peaked in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different market but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude what happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and\nShorting to market it happened very quickly\nYou'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles that first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths afterwards people get whacked\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble\nHas finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and and they get whacked hard so the danger sign is that we keep going down and and and literally the markets to look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far\nBut it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty were fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy\nEighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous uh uh\nYou know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asks what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that level ... this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles\nGo up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this this is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the science to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here\nAnd have it done and top here we only get the good part is we can gauges we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so correction by the end of the year that we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] what will this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't deliver to our debt emerging countries want on his free and they added\nSixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world and and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest debt bubble of any body and any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two\nThousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and redo so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\nSe she was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back curious dance with us his website is his name ...

T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff syllable lifetime and zero a\nGhost inside the new version of the ... am happy now available for iPhone in no Android board on ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nBut and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six\nTo seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not have well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd apart Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a you know a\nHundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent\nThat ended up beat that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep\nTheir earnings flat instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings white people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's almost it's not a secret\nWell I Know I Know believe\nMe Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened there there's the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stop and and and then when things go down\nThere that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are over Boston in stocks are about they're the ones that short for us I mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action what there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money that traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop just something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures let the smart money is doing versus the dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been\nShorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico new\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ...\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming\nIn I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality and a quarter the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport\nWhich I get to twenty minutes an advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt\nBelow al I'm not sure I liked that part\nWell it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing in landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify\nFor some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto geyser coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantage so I'm living much cheaper\nThan a man of great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami in two hours and in almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult to um coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did\nFor a long time that\nThat the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they'd been in a recession there's no civil unrest that's recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\n... percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now and then I'm just going to see what happens in the next to so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are buying banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks\nBecause this is by origin more of a Spanish country but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people either\nJust because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge debts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special\nPasta sauce and things like that otherwise you know this is a good deal and you know I'm Down here for other reasons but I'd say people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nMind that we need both in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving to the United states why sixty\nTwo percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their\nGrandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and the U.S it's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized\nPuerto Rico because the U.S as always always robbing the best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to use your impressions of what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now ... conflict\n... it's unbelievable I never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nIt does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in his zero our book\nThat that we're not just seeing a major boom peak globally in a major bobble and debt bubbles and all this de leveraging it and that that's going to make the next couple of years very devil you dean leverage debt these bubbles burst I mean again somebody's stock account is worth two hundred thousand\nOne day and then a year or two

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference these Puerto Ricans are not\nUm don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the less than a crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans you wrote in a democratic big deal ... what what was his point\nWell he well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled well I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando in a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key\nSenate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they didn't use\nThat one of our democratic ... isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question George and good morning I'm just like the ... over the congressional districts in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax Star Wars back the blue states subsidize the red states and the and the state that received the most was Kentucky with an idiot McConnell was I'm a destroys me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us until the mid west\nAnd I'm ... I'm for your gift\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying is has a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying [noise]\nOld will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if it were thirty five years almost forty years bar entity which is nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous here with the ... the tech stocks\nAnd then the two thousand they almost obliterated yeah we have a meeting of thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the camera angle trust in the body on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm pregnant rose bushes should come down from heaven\nAnd come back but the thing is what do we ask our financial\nPeople who are running our pension fund put their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYou know real quick they these two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing in monetary policy's push down long term rates\nBecause quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stock stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counter intuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do\nWhat we're telling people right now this this break up and yields is going to make bombs or corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen\nIn the next several months in the next year at the most you're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return is way better than almost any stock the evidence but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down an interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors and pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for pension plan is to do what everybody's that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all their life okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the north east and the west coast six feet from the union it it would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in the whole EU California Hey Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research and I really appreciate it um [noise] I mean you know\nYou brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions this war and\nYou could argue that the world today in San Antonio\nThird world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and when global corporations cannot compromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere's a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so\nDon't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country in a day or two you know with electro magnetic poles it's cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty\nPercent between World War one\nAnd World War two and with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising terrorists just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because nobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's\nThere is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundreds no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political sees this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade

we thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\nYeah love the reach of people George ... people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jay ... go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market is the new sectarian has to do with the ...\nAnd I happen to get in and mid July just before the huge and in the ... the ... but the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value on the bottom fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and kill the ... election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking you are that have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of like an upswing or would you pull out of that and now as it is a danger of ah what you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend uneven block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all of these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest\nSectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so you do have I mean I I Would say in this case you know you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop and yes I Do think\nCenter in such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few years especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah if things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term\nSocial political Trent it's going to go in that direction although there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good soccer but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash\nAnd and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went in the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations in that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games yeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then\nThen go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what you want oh you ... how do you know when the ... back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past\nCorrections I mean everything is different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies corrections stock corrections back then were fifty percent that's more typical this is more like these great resets ... de leveraging of a bubble debt\nAnd financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent as kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I start by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term\nBonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then and and and these sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stock and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the guy you may get\nTo buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yeah OK mothers dies or Democrat and more Democrats are\nMet then did you not say earner or did I misunderstand you that you said the south was read during the civil war\nThey they would have been they would have been more even though\nYou know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now\nIf you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats in a downturn in a ... in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation\nThe downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here\nTo a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people going like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats if it's a play of opposites that's\nJust as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east\nAnd that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff the long term surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong Congress think the short term predictable I'm guessing\nWhen I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers going to peak in two thousand seven in the economy was going to slow down and those gears that was not I guess that's science\nOf when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\nNext let's go to Gordon Lakeland, Florida in the wild card line endured and by the way next next week we're doing the show on student loans\nOh oh wow what a coincidence now any\nYeah George and hearing thanks for taking my call traditional I'm greedy or intro now first off I'm rolling conservative if you put in if you ask Google who's this Gordon\nOver in Lakeland, Florida that last for three decision on the ... thing I I did better than Jeb Bush it'll find me it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you I'm pro gun pro gun rights fiscally conservative so when I say\nThat they both liberal the Democrats and the Republicans have taxed students to death with college tuition and not done anything both parties are bad and voters in both parties don't want to be over tax tuition is a form of tax money go into an

often runs in families [noise]\nUm yeah that's true someone who say let's say well my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah I in fact I had a great a great aunt had an experience where she fell asleep and she woke up and she said her brother had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards\nShe found out yet to better use died while though yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do\n[noise] but you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women and I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\nI Would say both I Would say that there's a\nSort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences that protest in the brain so for example\nIf you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and that was quite young\nI had one at eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little section I've ever had I mean are there I was bouncing on the ceiling may looking at my body in bed or you stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I ... my mother said uh George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream than they are at that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up was jarred\nAmong eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also is it ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just find myself floating on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on like trickle stimulation on the right tempo cortex he was able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the van that tells me that the that everybody's being will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward um they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral\nProjection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has affected your medical student I dreamt us Rajiv exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam is the same as the first question in my dream\nCost you have the answer that you knew exactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam\nBut I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable\nIn fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the sometime a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomenon tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena because what I found and this is my own experience as well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong\nNot to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their stranger there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a\nLot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that word paranormal for example ... para I mean beside\nSo we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on the parent norm I mean beside normal it doesn't mean have normal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things\nAnd that was really what motivated me to read the\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ...\nNo I'm not familiar with ... she or her her\nIn a it was my aunt and she ... she went to a Oxford University right and she got her degree in psychiatry yet and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided\nShe was giving all that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced totally convinced\nThat the luck of the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that in so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know\nThat has really jumped into this\nOh I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting I'm\nBreakthrough to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander cruises heaven and hit the neurosurgeon and marry the Neal\nShe loved to have an impact she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in ... he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy them I mean she she just the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in radio\nFilled in there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show or no you\nThat's terrible it was just so well how does he gets so interested in like a thing\nShe just always wires and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York where they were studying the to the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming\nAnd in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to any teeth and um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the receivers when gene state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to be the fifth and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they were under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but\nIn my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr ... with us his book the borders of norm [noise]\n\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for bone and know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nUm that actually happened to my dad when he was in the hot though he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she's out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospital with dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them and they called them visitors\nI mean to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed vision to a very common\nNow one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and she says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and her three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside side of the same vision that the dying patients on\nAnd that's interesting because you know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut at the visions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction to their brains and they weren't on medication so um it's hard to know how to explain that and there again\nThe people who have these visions aren't necessarily relievers in the afterlife\nBut these experiences are quite common\nWhen Steve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many that he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow\nNow what do you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision\nYou know I'm a a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that would be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ... how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the patients who who died and where we ... Eighteen percent of them had been near the port in near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to the lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all had a lack of oxygen the pain\nNot just a ... a small percentage [noise] so you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that\nShow that these experiences are in many different countries them they'd be giving me put it throughout time [noise] and one study looked at patients who are on medication\nVersus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't talking medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed the vision that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that\nWell the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician males and Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends were all still living\nBut they've reported seeing angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the class and\nDid anybody else either\nNo so I could say I know they were a product of my own grain no one else saw them\nBut in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next level of the next world and\nThey made the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what you make that but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDo they see you\nI don't think so okay\nI don't think they were there for me I think they were there for my father right\nSo they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... ... [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise] you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals then why would the um visitors only ... the people who were deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they're the person who is dying doesn't know that there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death so the the brother that was near death\nHad the vision of his dad but it but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accidents you didn't know that there was the end\nAnd the other cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre tod do the dreams you put your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the and the very powerful\nAbout yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know if it seem as if the cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream\nBecause often and you know when people are sleeping during their dreams they tried to protest things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered now we could say that that was the peak cognitive team that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him [noise]\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to ... you sold your ... who is standing by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard of that too yeah yeah so that could have been ... cognitive embed another famous person who reported a prescribed interview with Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put out a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before\nAround the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with four words she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd three cognitive beams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning I deem start to fade the pre cognitive dream stay with us and we remember every detail\nSo the next day he went to give his reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red shah and she was introduced to him as ... Napier so so this stream was pretty cognitive dream and he\nDidn't know what to think of it or how to explain it but he he reported he had that the cognitive dream [noise] so um it's some people for example Larry ... is a person has written about\nYes I mean the ... century cognitive beams and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into theme or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the agreements week current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um this woman\nTold her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died in a terrorist attack\nAnd this is a number of years ago there was um [noise] I don't know if you've heard of it there was a air India\nDisaster way there was a terrorist attack aboard an air India flight from candidates Vancouver yeah and this woman was going to revert to visit her family in India and she was going with has been children but then it has been decided he had some work to do in Vancouver he's they'd be hiding behind and he was going to meet her there\nCom slash BCS and you'll find out why to us it's personal\n\nGet rid of the buses and noises given a new HD Radio for your car and home and heroes with crystal clarity we're broadcasting image to sixteen twenty WTO ...\nCleaned up the begins ...

into dream or premonition you know and I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all connected\nAnd somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to

Would let them come to you you know because they may not be ready\nDo you have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you're open to the experience

topics tonight about um the paranormal and or something I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and be\nA Judeo Christian teacher of the Bible a missing link could be\nA the content of a book called eternal man and anybody can Google that or search it on YouTube or Amazon you can find different lectures and things about that and over the years out of\nIt is a book written by a BYU religion of ... professor and over the years I've just listening to coast to coast\nIt's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps against them understand the aftermath of of the journal nature and our spiritual nature\nAs well and um to switch to another topic really quick I'm a ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by\nA listener on the coast to coast a lot about you ever got experience I've had two friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other about twenty five days after the second one\nI had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as for about\nThirteen Years ago I think and uh I can still remember today um I don't remember what happened before the than some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury in my dream but\nThe but it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that thought in an era Taylor thought in your consideration\nAbout the possibility of\nA the certainty of\nDr ... the Ford about the events that she said happened to her but yet all the people that she mentioned that I think one of them you anything about that and ah the dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment\nWhere the second friend had little he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and and uh the at the end of this time the dream we set out to my\nBrother and me off the later and they looked at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead oh ...\n... there's a a pretty young lady that was wearing like quote a charcoal grey quote I'm cutting coke a standing next to him I didn't know who that was had seen her before\nAnd this was in a in a

you were in our final segment with Dr among many meets his his book is called the borders of normal and many when you're putting in a book together was there are some part of it are just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nI think the most interesting thing with the deathbed vision\nYou know because I Will acting that I didn't realize how common that was [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and vision and out of body experience is associated with near death experience but I wasn't really ... with a deathbed visions or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very common\nThe death bed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like to look at it and the point of view of the body plus the mind of the emotional life plus the spiritual life so I think that for different components in each one it's important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them I mean the cases have ... people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win the lottery\nWow you know I'm I don't hit

Thirteen Years old she said she thought lining light light and you heard of voice which he identified as the ... coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been\nDocumented by many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how\nThis works Mandy ... it's it's you know let's call it the God factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why they were the first place what do you think\n[noise] that fit the ferry and it came to my mind if it's out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt get that the different level or a different dimension to where I live and then somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience can have the meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be given by going to Joe in Long Island New York hey Joseph go ahead\nYeah Hi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the trains\nAre interestingly I had to raise rates simply that began with a preference of the day it set of I've told the first\nAnd I ended up at the beach I go on the water for a little rough but this other people's why they again it's usually warm which would be the case why\nBut I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same date\nIn real life so my question would be with your dream about half\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise] ah so I ask you about that you know what do you think and the case that trains are going to\nIt can be some super fluid sort of extraneous materials in the team that's not necessarily related to the main point on the team so I think to a certain extent you'd have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel apply to you in which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nSo they don't you jump yeah that that was good yeah okay\nGood next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west of the Rockies Mary going in\nHigh school stopped there also perform because I won't right on well dream stay he's talking about my father is the most\nProminent before he died a week before he died I tell people my father walked up to death in ... than in ... which I'm Serious a week before he died he was talking to people he was just so happy he had been scraped\nHe wouldn't tell us what was why you sit and read before he yeah he called the ... are you ready to die\nAnd she was shocked she says oh I don't think about that and no way I mean he was just\nUnusually cat and the and that night he passed it was pretty it in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning and I was so sleepy that\nUm my brothers and sisters and I knew most of his brothers or sisters will get it out on the porch there waiting for me and he said I'm going with so and I was ... he said look look to to seal I looked out the screening I didn't hear anything and oh so he uh\nI went back to sleep 'cause that was so sleepy three in the morning he over there we laugh I didn't know what can we woke up the next morning and my mother's like have you guys see your dad and I told her I said mom\nHe told me last night he was going but his brothers and sisters and she was like shocked she knew the ramifications but I get you know and my dad I think he was part native or something but he always told me he should win\nOlder people in the native culture get old you said they go out in the woods or somewhere and they die I've heard some people in Alaska get in a ... jacket just go out and you know the water and\nThat's the way he did mhm\nI'm to the area that used to be an Indian burial ground area and they found him like two weeks later and I think\nFor many years in the south some people really spooky and if you die in a home it likes brain that stuff to it or he didn't want to fight and the kids I think it's I think it would kind of had a fine I don't know but he knew he was dying when they found that\nHe did not look like he was struggling they made it look like you get that from where I'm just path\nThat's a that's a great story in in many these visitors come to us whether they're nearly departed or strangers but the business is there like a rural or a mission for them\nWell if you're talking about the visitors that people who are dying have definitely there the mission because they help a company that person to the other side\nAnd it's especially on what your caller was talking about her father and brothers and sisters came to visit and then he went with him to the and then they found his body two weeks later so I Would say they helped him accompany him to the other side", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "12"}
