headquarters a trial which tonight is the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening\nI Am your host tribute church and tonight my guess is my new save\nSaturday every body which gets started\nListening to me everybody wants the gift that keeps on giving that special gift one\nThat you don't put in a drawer and forget about no it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nForty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly level rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for\nNorth south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly\nAnd yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I have relatives nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but\nIt's really big [laughter] that's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred\nYears to figure out the language and you would think that with all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up\nWho knew how to read write or speak any of it but it never happened\nAnd although today we know about the Rosetta Stone and the quest to the code everything the great and eat eat Egypt shunned amnesia that was already happening and in full swing centuries before Cleopatra committed suicide\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing I'm a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the rope a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and published in that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramid a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belts does for a while and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three it was a little\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of email and they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol\nOf a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue um I noticed it and then I just got to put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing book\nBy the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows all the dreams dealer\nWhich is you know in front of the cause of this ... between the positive things and\nThat was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked by itself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a stains then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember at the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page Robert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was caused the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting at breakfast and I will I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that\nDidn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nIt was so compelling that\nI didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it is a this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the mother gives apply to in general but you have the great pyramid the grades banks are two things that dominate everything that you can achieve for miles\nBut is not documented the anywhere in Egypt in history where you would think\nWell you know the ... love to write everything he loved to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great strengths and the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found a record store the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with this famous you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nIn scripture that refers to the ... for example than a than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\nThe pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool and from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that too there's actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the ... uh in in in the two of its called the horizon of coup food and\nNext to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they call that cover his grade and Cooper's pyramid was called the rise of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plateau and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou aren't the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how it was built or who built it or the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose\nAnd that it's very confusing all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but the you know this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years\nUm and there were machines that were hauling up to blocks but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just too confusing is ... ... yeah we also have the same issues and if there was a for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all but\nYet the what the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to fourth who is the author of the dream still up between the positive things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it\nOn and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name Cooper was the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the human towards the guy says very unequivocally when ... came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken he repair that and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast damn are murals to be church or ... minute said siding and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMuch more emotionally loaded onto the you know\n[noise]\n\nOr ... minute said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dreams DOMA right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dream stolen a top most of the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second snakes well there's two things\nThere I Know there Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question I'm Out of it so that was that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut ah and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things\nAre and that doubled edits things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end\nBy as things and these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but it's there it's things buried under the fans are that say west of a free spirit it's possible\nThe\nTeam and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops said that he repaired this things but builds agreed pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most ... do not accept the inventories you are as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to a texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd their specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to me means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of text where you know the pivot building has mentioned and the the verb that that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the fires of ... that was found in ... and the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is my ... talks about tour store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was amazing interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I to be that that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up the courses and then you ... ... so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind\nAbout it and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also when the gays applied to write I could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson a this was also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is new to it so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her but the southern most of the three ah of the three a queen permits that are on on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn even tourists there like it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think it's the poop shows that she was a prince says so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or uh\nAnd um and then doing you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why colleges reject this though because they're saying you know if this were an old ... story or at the time of coup who\nThese ... ah you know ISIS on her side as we're not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well um but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the ads or we have all the houses perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surrounding smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man with the same care\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant it's even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're ... stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality a you know they're smaller size but into the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the word friendship definitely declined um after the old getting them\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you don't like uh\nUh the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nAnd that's also what I wanted to do I want to really get some\nInformation out of the pyramid without you know uh putting my hand on of course the chips in government is protecting the monuments and I completely agree with that they're making it very difficult for you know invasive studies to be done because they want to protect the monuments and I are um you know I agree with um I I think we should first\nInterviews with newsmakers to time for one final your review of W.

to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belt that uh it looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby are they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we were in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but I go back lead happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first Senate is the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I call it their armies age and the bells and whether it looks like but did that age that ages repeat it\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to taffy um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\n... will do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley Tempe and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared and I mentioned it later on in the show thank you bury\nNo problem thanks for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call bring him on all of them yeah let's let's go to this is a let's go to\nLet's go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nMorning and command that great guinea and non ... [noise] I don't want to play I like now if he had looked at any yet at highway highway ... in Iceland\nAt ... highly effective up highway of any age and I\nAnd also I I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular one the second part now listen over there and\nWhether he and and and the hobbit and and shock ... had can hit it some of the um\nThe African and African American ballet who study the net net net too at\nA week the name of the language which is a lot of that that ... that you know a phrase south of where it didn't say quit and when he looked at people who call themselves a candidate\nFor instead of the game and you know before they that Greeks came in and can hit it and have a hippie Kennett college this ten minute when we got word from for chemistry and\nAlso um the what you think\nWhy that would work I think we got came up with and can they\nWhat they can find with the little it's not what it is and the African American guy like that I'm thinking that they call it a little odd that arise showed a ton will oh God oh sad if you follow them a ... and and I'll listen off the air\nThank you bye ad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience they don't play around with the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... actually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's Beck's Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this was in the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long\nUh it describing seven hundred\nAt these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him all caps time so um if there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course come in a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand your kitchen language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two um UGA\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt of probably from Bhutto\nAnd brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as opposed to any uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you don't ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting uh the analogy a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned his things so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before hurricane I think it was a we would think it was a line there's and their name was made eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get my news saved Sunday is paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n[noise]\nFind more about tonight's just log on to goose ... stadium dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nLearned for yourself fly off the race ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report I learned to drive later Arizona State university for more information about on the one line talks live two three five five wind sat and that's how the two three five five lines happening\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell come back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess tonight and Manu save Saturday we're talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week\nHow to locate them and I want to say really quick minute\nThat Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that does coordinate point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates too had been\nHaven't yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIntegrate see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience\nAnd and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where\nThe math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the fun of Shakespeare sonnet\nSue the coordinates or not to heaven but uh uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the corners of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinates that Alan just discovered\nA fall right next to them I thought of him you know which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd his you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed is I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have among coast next month\nOkay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody into the the ... report PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found is when you get the guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off of the of the canal drops suddenly there's a depression and the way he's interpret one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allowed that four to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there's probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty fix will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with twenty fifth um and and then that let's go and so you know there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by them you on again\nNow the row let's let's let's get to this for a second in the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it it going up words every body of one of those seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nBy right yeah and and it was graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration is is an old illustration\nUm so that that particular shafted dot go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have around ... the twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the care of it I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ring in other words there is a space\nAt designs they have not thought you know an accidental space it designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses you\nKnow you just got back from Egypt\nYeah we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which\nUh did help find this cavity this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nSo I saw a new detectors being place I'm at this time in a different location and last time so laugh\nPlace um I did find a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to come from and there was confirmed that the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what the ... detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere a particle called them you want is created and the new on is\nA negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nOr didn't electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds I'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs\nAnd in this case you can basically quote unquote ... pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it ... then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because of New Orleans will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid still and so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the [noise] the chambers that you are proposing in the ever happened to me\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifacts will and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that that could be some some of the lower once maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back um let's face seven\nTwenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a a is if there's a space on the northern side on the northern half of the pyramid that it will get picked up\nBy the scan um it's also possible they put the deck to place in places that we don't know for example the you know the uh the chamber's above baking chamber\nYeah and we would never find out about that nobody gets to go up there\nYou can look out the window or click on line ... either way you get the weather though

has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things they're looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that should be just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that they are it to our spaces under this things and one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular\nUh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something that's of interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we are what we would like to do first as to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti\nAnd maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know what you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and then Robert uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that space is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have lots of marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so it didn't really ah you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know it's like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd wouldn't be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we're try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around yeah we're quite a while it would just be great to finally uh put this to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water\nAnd in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber\nOr the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever might be inside um you know so this isn't enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of those things tissues came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter\nAnd I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lion is there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about\nAlien jury tee when it comes to ...

you know I think that was Eric ... data can\nInvite that originally that she's talking about the ... yeah or the right the lid off the uh South Africa as a ... right\nI have I have that's our topic is

new and I don't have any other way to look at that step for the controls hand controls an oxygen mask slain coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI you know I don't have any problem with that I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is it to this day and age everything's on tables you just said it we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there isn't tell I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe\nYou know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following is but it you know there is one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nUh that just like Robert Duvall proposed in cosmic war is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is it may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um\nAh through a cotton fields\nAnd that message ends up on earth somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid um I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is\nBut we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for a minute\nAbsolute on her speeches guys really quickly a notion struck me when you talk to a very structured spaces a look or make it quick a couple of quick jumps and laundry looking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the trauma ...\nSuper big John charging term papers a farming old knowledge globally big golfers structures uh who's to say I mean we could do\nYou know I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid\nBecause they know may be just as you say it's structured spaces be actually filled with Ford Rajiv on the rocks and uh everything arches inside big cavities like temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly\nThe conclusions are that by news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on budget sticks basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scandal was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know he reviewed a paper or but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to have real quick uh because\nThe pyramid of course who it's it's as high spaces inside researchers in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid budding coffers pyramid all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back or gas my new stateside they this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm

Egypt um I think\nUh there is ... Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence at well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this was from Jay and Jay's says I heard the surgeon tools for found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know uh it was found in the I think it was in the northern\n... a shaft of the queen chamber by a wait a minute Dixon um and he uh and it's now and the British Museum a with a with a ... with a ground ball\nUm but whether or not that was a surgery with ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here on ms\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next on Kos Adam ... new\nName on it Hi Jimmy yeah the really academic discussions tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering\nCould they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think\nBecause there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's your logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end that\nSo in the opposite is a day or the ... was known for the center of the worship of denying major God is kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these ... these and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one\nThat is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy worlds and they are or what the inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting is that if what if that were ever to be found a but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o do I think this is still on the table that there may have been space is there that\nCult of workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already got inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it indoors or less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt\nI Am heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades and that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the supply\nBut today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt shouldn't areas as depicted in the race\nNazis research Egypt shouldn't areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] um as a good question it is a great question it's a great question the question um\n\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before before Nazi Germany um there there was of course German activity on Nick he's a plot so there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the ... uh George rise and are from Harvard and uh\nAnd how ... from a from the German a fun life sick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us in Iraq but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties\nAnd then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted or end there was a big break 'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment because I don't know\nLet's go to a show out east in the Bronx Joe you're next on goes\nHow ya doing Jimmy I'm doing good Joe Santa Manu\n[laughter] Hyman knew how I Would take to good\nUh yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is there any evidence that there are any any tunnels underground passage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramids in the vicinity and also can you tell me whether there are any signs of blueprint that\nExist for either the great pyramid or any pyramids in that area\nA that's a fantastic question so\n[laughter] that's right up my alley so the first question do I am I Would refer you to Andrew calling so I don't know if you ask ... Collins this question he will probably say yes I'm that there are there is a cave system that connects all these pyramids I I don't know just for a fact but\nTony ... dot com slash BCS and you'll find out why to us it's personal\n\nTickle or Brian broadcasting stations everywhere on your mobile phone launching loaded where do you where did you learn dot com sixteen twenty\nWhat to do about the missing Saudi journalist diamond Carrick Fox News President Trump says wait and see what more is learned lawmakers say a multibillion dollar arms deal should be reconsidered\nFlorida Republican Senator Marco Rubio says even as the Saudis denied any knowledge of harm against journalist or mall 'cause she'll be a one hundred billion dollar arms deal is a significant bargaining chip to get a true\nIt gives you leverage over them because they need a replacement parts that need the training\nBut Rubio warned on CBS face the nation if it's found that the Saudis detained or even ...\nThe Congress right now there is no pro Saudi element that's going to stick with our relationship with Saudi Arabia is currently structure\nA vote on Capitol Hill was being considered to stop the arms deal from happening in light of possible Saudi involvement brutal Scott ...\nAt least forty people are injured for our critical after a bus crash in California this\nAccident happened around one o'clock many drivers on the south bound side were stuck in traffic for nearly three hours the buck was driving on the north side of the four or five when it flipped over the media and and that will card and a total of forty\nFour people were treating on the seats those are both butts passengers as well as ... and all those forty four people were treated on the twenty five of them were taken to the hospital\n... is with Fox affiliate Katie TV independent Senator Bernie Sanders blasting White House economist Larry Kudlow on ABC's This week for saying that climate change report by the United nations is overestimated\nWe are in crisis mode and you are but administrators shouldn't that virtually does not even recognize the reality of climate change and their policies working with the fossil fuel industry or make it a bad situation worse\nThe un reports that forty five percent decrease\nIn emissions is needed by twenty thirty this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is ... times ... written the cannery and we're excited to be a part at Fox Nation because now more than ever really powerful voice was different from anything you've heard before nation ... dot com and sign up now\nFox News rundown dives deep into the major and controversial story is looking to buy the interest of Fox subscribe now you're a perspective of news you won't find anywhere I'm going to a plug sneak budgeting job\nWas watching the news they want someone to try our job is to cut through the talking points more than ... we're going to ask the question because there's a lot of conventional wisdom out there\nThat needs to be challenged in bringing when I'm doing is making sure that whenever you know through the day people are fully informed from coast to coast were twenty four seven news really down just a minute we're going to be fearless we're going to be fair weather ... midnight were they treated\nAll real news real honest opinion [noise]\nGet ready it's open enrollment season for Medicare\nTurning sixty five countries at least one benefit you can enroll in Medicare open enrollment starts today and continues through December seventh if you're already enrolled in Medicare you can make changes to your coverage\nThere are fifty eight Medicare Advantage plans available in twenty Nineteen and twenty six Medicare prescription plant you can find out more from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services on line at C.

the south side the ladder get over it and you have any comments like we're looking for hidden chambers but obviously we've already Allen to them right when we get to know what's inside\nNow he's talking about the south side of the rear of the things\nThis ... I see the south side yes um there is a ...\nOr so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember this correctly or there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes\nUm and ah\nBut I mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when you when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on based on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think that there is more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJay y ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail end he looks down on the ground and he sees what do you think is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nSo he he leads over grabs would picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there\nYeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side of the rear flanked by the scale of this stinks and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw it with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about uh the veracity I think that there is there's there are spaces under the springs the main question is does it go anywhere it was just apply pouch that's the main question\nYou brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now he is he is that is one of the decrees these videos\nAnd now he is he is that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean it is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was right and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long dead stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex\nThere wasn't supposed to be anything there then ... denied that there were any tunnels there later went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again was supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential\nPathway from the ... or from the uh the oath Irish shaft um you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt poses are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper the I'm Talking about the specifically I talk about the old Cyrus shop it's possible that the upper two layers are late kingdom but the the\nLower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure and it may could act um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah it until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of ... causeway uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you have to start coughing cars submerged in water\nAnd the surrounding that the base and that sort of the shape of the ear cliff for house\nI'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and and the the four pillars around and it was fascinating\nAh you know there's a there's some the symbolism of it but\nThe dating of it I I'm I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the ... the plateau and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the ... you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to to that or ... or Cyrus shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period to belonging to\nA no official called um ... cop or something like that I Can't remember the name but again that's just the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nYou know we don't think we know\nAnd ... before we had to the break ... ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the gays applied to there's an awful lot of sand there yeah but\nWell my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know a besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things it could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict inane mentors the paper we're predicting that there may have been also a temple\nOr east of the valley temple a and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there are things on the west side\nYou know of course that's it that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the ... of course everything facing west in facing the Nile a there's a there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway in the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau\nThere is an awful lot a that is behind the uh the pyramid complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and uh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds\nBut there is a construction that is represented in those original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military\nZones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends and the oval office placement um but there's nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone\nSo yeah I mean to your point in the in the west the old way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows what we're going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back to the coast

amazing conversation tonight and and listening to an answering all of the questions from the coasts listeners not only a via the phones but of course Twitter too as well an amazing amazing\nThis is great yeah it's just it's it's such an important time for research and what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up\nUh some of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last a segment here\nLet's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nA morning ... warning James\nOr good morning Larry Ann how are you in the hurricane were you okay\nAh where I'm located here my God me but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but it it it was a such a wide big storm that it it it it affected everything up north they're\nA bill for those people have lost everything\nYeah yeah so you guys were okay over on that side will ever\nGo on this side we've got a little weather but rain and whatever but we're good\nAll right Larry what do you have for my new\nQuick or Edgar Edgar Edgar Casey on Atlanta it's a paper bag right it might be interested in reading or do you does life reading a first for march Nineteen sixty eight\nBut ah he talked about between ten thousand seven thousand period or if it's a migration of the carpet in return\nAnd then vote they conquered Egypt [noise] one of the later this trial was re Tom ...\nWith ring holiday that of course I'm ... all one was basically the chamber the chamber and then you can train for it if not a to write a according to the news you might check that out of the very end lightning\nAnd the original capstone with court\nUm ... the pyramid pyramid has granted in it which produces under pressure five electricity and you may know all that's already I maybe would have done that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey\nEnergy that tell your current earth currents of the Nile is rerouted route are adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it to generate a electricity\nMalaria let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question are you ready if I can answer absolutely if the uh you know and Christopher done and others have talked about uh the\nPyramid being a machine or possibly a generator power and energy all of that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free\nEnergy yeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nOr as I said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model\nIs a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that is you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive first\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast\nWow Hi Carol hello Carol\nQuite several years ago\n... last Sunday why ... ... pound artifact I thought oh man power plants hatchery him all underground oh well here\nOh not when I'm there ground oh did you\nHear anything about you\nKnow I as far as I Know it I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to them is not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of their research\nGreat yeah that's a great question ... so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explain to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt causes this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nUh but you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know associated affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and do you have to you know you have to do the application you have to as a they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think\nYou know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nAnd and and what they found and I carry and why ... is it in a national only twice\nYeah and and Carol ... one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others\nIs blog right research and and and publish in self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new that others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I I encourage than I encourage blogging and creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end\nLet's let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next tacos men\nDon't give me how you doing and I know a thing over the participating or what I what I wanted to know like the gentleman that called before\nA ... that there was that a bird or something on the higher ... on on the the the\nTwo teams but there was also one in uh\nIn Peru and there was a little one the medical if those ... may mean the thing being if the bird in the same thing oh that's a good question and your and my other question I wanted to know how come ... August ... be bored\nAnd you say right off the bad blood\nMoney it costs a lot of money and stuff in there\nYeah your I'm Sorry I'm not hearing hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a more why you answered this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where that was his point but the first\nOr the birds a dinner represented throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramids and why we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that uh you know a ... early research has worked confronted with when they looked at the Egyptian ... lives is if the symbol is the sound or if it if it actually\nMeans what it shows uh that's probably the most important questions so when you have a bird in an Egyptian a text a most likely most of the time the bird is not\nWhat is the the the symbols that's not me I have nothing to do with the bird\nIt ... it's basically a sound so when you see an old it's the letter M. it has nothing to do with it now actually when you see the fog and so that's horse um but if you see let's say a chick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "College Station", "day": "15"}
