[noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute\nThere's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study a I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that in finance is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not seized life on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop\nAnd that brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say it it must be in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere ah in trying to get you little messages every once in a while\nNow just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him

when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better [noise] one of the things that's really help to me\nIs to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the Internet and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have disability [noise] but I think of the brain as the infinite zone\nAnd I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat'd you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nDuring the cold really then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it off and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it and the mylar balloons state inflated for many months\nTwo three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\n... gets timing and secret the city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and\nI turned off the lights and I was leaving the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back with the light switch back down put it back up put it back down they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off\nAt that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\n[laughter] which is the point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I have struggled to try to understand how the generic\nDrug industry in the United states has effectively shield it themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIt there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student ah frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most on us um\nLikeable young man you could you could think of\nNow did you go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand ... they take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital I\nI think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood that with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emerging\nStudents as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cool\nWell I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your joints and let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we could look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from their synchronous cities just roll in um um we\nWere both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two he was nine fourteen sixty eight every number we have to do it this is not at nine I mean ... fourteen or a seven or its divisible by seven\nYeah

probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one and in our case we think that that happened a planet nine but planet nine didn't get paused quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge\nBut if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could have been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there's a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something massive like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planet with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally you'll read the headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [noise]\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times\nThose were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our first\nWere even out past Pluto out in the ... what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our solar shouldn't be an apartment in the planet that we know of but it has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so\nJupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us planet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter to its effect it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over\nFour billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and ended up point will announce existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right of ways we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] good so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nSo there you have a Oregon right from the man who discovered the uh in terms of those ... of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gathered together out where the guy prevailed in the\n... cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research project with these scientists is that I have no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system from a mercury\nAssad and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and urine is our because Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing that could be out\nComing this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity in math and I it it would have impact on every single thing and so\nThat's the way I Would have loved those Zacharias ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would have been able to convince him about that ...\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion of the face eye to\nEye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do that for conversations and Glenda because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nShe doesn't agree and some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar I mean the translation that we're a carbon done\nAnd you look at the carvings one thing that always\nIs confusing to me talking about a Trump planet but in the can of warm air or eleven guy\nTo hold on right there in the let's come back we'll look finished that up in conversations [noise]\n\n\nReduce a large portion of your debt no goal national debt relief at

knowing what you were back with ... you know whose story next we'll deal with climate change window\nYeah you know with Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world\nWith really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change and real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide\nBlankets around the earth and at the United nations\nMany countries especially those worried about being Ireland and which sea level rise could flood and displaced population they came together to form the inter governmental\nPanel on climate change also known as the eye PCC and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis to help project some of these impacts\nOn world politics and the economy by twenty Fifteen only three years ago\nAnd the Paris Agreement on climate change many small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the PCC committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientists from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming two degrees Celsius\nOr one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels\nThe October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit ... the the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's the only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't\nIf I planet continues to warm up above that limit\nOf one point five degrees Celsius scientists warn there will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills out other marine species dependent upon the coral\nWeather will become more violent and when the flooding rains and devastating wildfires weather extremes will cause salmon and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island and coasts populations to move\nBut to where\nThe twenty Eighteen IPC report said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal\nIt as an industry around the world it must be phased out they're coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote this kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend\nThat this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen consequence he is professor drew ... del\n... a professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top side places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nations in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report those\nCountries want to the United nations to investigate a lower warming target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the\nSouth Pacific also ... and the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries and then there are very low like countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population changed very close to sea level\nNigeria has huge population she read your level but you know sodas most of the world or in the in the United states also has an enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's one of the nation rising sea levels and melts the ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the wage can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already having to be evacuated and moved to higher ground\nSo it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd you see that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere has not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events you know becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to after the evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places\nThere's an island in the peak for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it is already going to change the water come up through the drains skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding there was very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments have had to put a marker so that\nMotorist can see how deep the flooding is is so routine in Florida it's been some of the worst flooding of streets\nIs this a routine and Florida it's been some of the worst flooding of street in the southeast part of the state has become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dumped more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models and then watch the models\nHave often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the author of the ice and the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the bottles project to\nYes the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely be warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a blurry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized\nBased on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the bed pillow\nYou know when we were we because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty eight team what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions\nAnd receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd will even the sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that killed thousands of people\nThat kind of thing that would have been you know maybe every fifty years or so that will start to become more and more frequent and it'll begin to happen maybe a decade or so where places like

anybody whether they're in a duck tape and experience or meditate or had they had any insights about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science which said that uh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six in which there could be some\nEither a natural cycle\nOr something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause your nominees and tremendous amounts of flooding and I had had now several emails and I'm going to be doing stories on them about\nExactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven\nAnd a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading the answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are all for coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category

guy\nHe also sent me his duty to fourteen to prove his military background like Dr included at the end of my earth files news report tonight this email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in title closed\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not alone\nAnd it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now\nBut at the time that the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty six I within my bed one night and I have woke up and could not go back to only\nHear now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any town voice like that and him as a child and hotter tend to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children and my mother's friends had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment and it's two levels\nYou have to go up the stairs we get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother in two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night\nI have trouble going back to sleep and not just there and in the dark couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet here many cars that's how I knew it was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your cargo by\nSo I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a light a bright light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at it 'cause it was the only thing in the sky\nI noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the life that I was looking at came down it was ... or ...\nWhat I noticed about that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they have they closed the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nIt look like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but with so little all if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle a shawl white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in assault Hawaii began in this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYou know I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood balloon so pretty and it's like you're looking at a seafood belong and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing again now and he's looking up\nYou just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what are you looking at it but I could clearly see this and I'm seeing them myself looking at this person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet\nFrom this exit the only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out this grieving go down there you love is going to the beach you [laughter] you know\nWhat I was like man I wanted to go but mom's gonna beat and you'll probably

think it is a physics part of the universe and other dimensions that we have been denied or had never been told or ever educated about\nIt's always been thrown into the bin of methodology or something else and that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new\nCosmic understanding of the physical relationship between the ... the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have to be protected from another dimension more and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions and if\nWe cycle if that's so

free using this national security and that the schools in\nBecause there were people at risk about safety that we would not do we'll take a\nHard time into it and yeah\nI understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years uh where I began my first investigation into animal mutilation in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's twenty Eighteen\nStrain sharpest was ...\nStrange harvest and uh it was a a well received a documentary it was awarded a regional Emmy uh so I was dealing from a chore as pure fact they journalism as I could in that film and I had\nTo wrestle myself with the question of going out in the pasture as often by myself together to issue and and various things\nAt my vulnerable and having to decide within myself that I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me a so be it\nAnd I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where Anna mutilated animals are now\nWhat I'm trying to do is set a a different lens and framework here yes there are animal mutilation that were animal sacrifices five thousand\nSeven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet as well those animal sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence that is today in the twentieth and twenty first century or doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up\nTo the animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular\nI think that there are many facets I think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies\nWhether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension I Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have\nSurvived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the hell does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact that humans\nHave been abused him misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet in the solar system\nNow that doesn't\nThe fed and human being cruel to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible\nBut I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human creature that we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution\nOf our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is\nUntil all of us know all of the truth than animal mutilation that human abductions and all of the facets which seemed very disturbing may not be understand ... be understood and a correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting\nAnd that is why I feel so strongly that we have got to move the entire planet and break through like at San Andreas fault that's what it's going to be like and that sort of what you're asking\nThe San Andreas fault has to be the global announcement a consensus of the entire planet\nThat we're not alone in this universe\nAnd that the governments of this planet have to start opening up what they have in terms of physical craft and being and knowledge\nAbout who is manipulating and why if we add allies we no need to know who our allies are and not be afraid of them if there are hostile as they described\nBy some people who have worked in the government is on friendly we need to know who they are why they're hostile and that we have allies that are helping us\nAnd deal with
