several things including the cycle mantey him which was popularized by\nAre different ... the originator of the term near death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight is Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing that's like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away from free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with\nThe way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you you got that\nAren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd a number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because\nI started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nI Would go into a haunted place someone would take me into a room and say this is the most haunting room and I would look around and the two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and faith to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I fight a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirror if that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and off it\nSo mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRank like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state no no\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly ... portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psych them anti and they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother ... and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her any pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble ... thing you know you have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude\nThat's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact\nUh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair and so the basic thing you need is a big\nMirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of it and I bought that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... and ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent but I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people\nHad some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on anthrax\nDramatic Josh stay with us we'll come back and talk about time warps and some UFOs here's our first emerging artist Paul Rubin from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\n[noise] you know\nWhen to when\nA\nSign up for ... or ... ... email newsletter neither today at ... am done\nBetween Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played on a a group from\nAshville North Carolina green group\nOr [laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting declare an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence\nOr are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidence ...\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be an effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does that Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that they were working on this thing back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada\nTo keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow up [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night your words as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars\nAnd also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in\nThe state of Nevada and they're good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional\nAerospace related findings he goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and\nThe standard management in safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified either independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWe're could've possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to that's where they go down a list of some of the topics that have been\nA an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking worm holes in space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution the scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with ... July twenty fifth or right so that said now we moved up to August\nAugust of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ...\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb\nAnd they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space for it so\nThat said\nI Am of the impression here\nThat there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry\nThat is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out and it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George you think that that is our coincidence that this stuff is winding up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated\nAnd want to do in this huge Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from when President Trump announced a space for ...\nDo you think it was the same motives\nI think it was certainly part of it\nUh well for one thing there's probably pretty good reason to believe that something like a space for its has existed for a long time now uh I mean we know how these classified projects work I mean they're classified for ten Fifteen Twenty years\nKnow\nWhen we get a chance to to Rush Limbaugh what we think we say thanks big guy Rush Limbaugh we do that he loves the WTO W College Station [noise]\nPlans for a celebration and in tragedy I'm an Carrick Fox News twenty people were killed Saturday in a limousine crash and the town of skill Harry New York west of Albany the limousine reportedly headed to a birthday party Christie or a with New York state police\nSeen has been cleared at this time of the victims\nHave been transported or overly medical center\nWere autopsies are now being conducted\nThe state police investigations continuing with interviews\nEvidence processing inclusion reconstruction\nPlease say the SUV limousine went through a stop sign hitting a parked empty vehicle at the apple barrel country store in addition to heading to pedestrians tropical depression Michael picking up strength and heading towards the Gulf Coast Fox meteorologist Adam clot\nPretty good agreement as where this is going to head as it starts to move north you see several models they're scratching along the Gulf Coast there the for the Gulf Coast may be running over towards portions of Alabama or Mississippi still a little early to know where this will be making landfall but the timeline currently we're looking at this getting to the coast perhaps on Wednesday\nFlorida governor Rick Scott declaring a state of emergency for some areas for critics have new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh the site is not over\nSenator and Judiciary Committee member Chris Coons a Democrat says justice Kavanaugh may now be on the high court but Coontz says his mind has not been changed I think there are good\nNow beyond the high court but Coontz says his mind as not been gene\nI think there are good reasons to have doubts about a now justice Kavanaugh's candor to the committee and fitness to serve\nBut to hear that the result of a possible mid term takeover of the house by Democrats could mean impeachment talk for traveling all\nSenator Coontz bet on NBC's Meet the press I think that's premature he says what he and his fellow senators should be concerned about is fueling the political division Mrs called colonel Scott's Fox News this is Fox News [noise]\nAnd more of your favorite for the time in the\nNation coming soon but I Know they can be the personal\n... you know Fox News rundown the weekly morning project but I've been to the major and controversial stories a good day to buy the anchors of Fox News radio described no to your perspective of news you won't find anywhere else on Fox News or just a job because\nThere's so much parking and noisy yelling our role is to take three steps back and just from what really matters the most important thing that we do we are looking out for the ... men and women in this country lowering them they're going to get a straight shooter no holds barred I'm not going to cut people flash\nFox is the one place for a while we have voices we won't be\nControls my voice [noise] nobody Fox News channel\nReal news real honest opinion\nViolence in Chicago cleans the life of a toddler\nPolice say two year old Julie dissolves was fatally shot what someone fired into a crowd outside of party Saturday Night detective say a fight between two women it's spelled out of the house it into an alley we're crowd had gathered\nThe little boy was on the sidewalk outside the home when the shots were fired Julian was with an Eighteen year old man who shot in the leg and survive\nIn a separate incident Saturday Eighteen year old James Garrett was fatally shot while attending a vigil on the city's far south side we say about a hundred people were at the vigil when an argument broke out to people started shooting ...

you're disrespectful to the stall and if you're nice to have to do then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the Dole was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the ... like in the window we're running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest increase thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that\nHe was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene and gene became obsessed with this stall when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very successful man\nUh had had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change his infatuation with the dog I mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there was some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just for the drifted away that never happened\nFor gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so are his room was essentially moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but\nYou know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house in the house that their abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a buyer to come along\nAnd I actually did get to talk of some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences but nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows\nAnd you'd look up when you knew that house was\nInterviewing knew there were ever read see little Robert de do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next stump let's go to the time or in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo ah Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\n... years ago it was around uh August and I spirit who crazy life on to make it to make a brief\nI was up a around like black Baltimore area\nMe and my friends were just hanging out up there\nThat are around like black Baltimore area\nMe and my friends were just hanging out up there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kinda swept in in the afternoon like we were watching the ... all of a sudden it's super thick fog to that and there were like six to eight what looked to be\nLike jeep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right after we got to thinking about it\nWe're at and overlook there was no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them and like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off\nUm come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what the heck was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it\nAnd uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really tried to contact you but we're not trying but you know willing to talk to you for about twelve years now the the the what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh\nWell it's highly thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Asheville in another tar hill and um you know right on that in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mouth in life because the brown mountain lights are the most famous exam\nAnd you've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mouth and\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain lead a leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise] if you I mean if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain life dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um\nBut what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off\nSo you get more grossly encounter is people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian Z on planet earth that acupuncture is might compare it to the Meridian of energy the flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball lightening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua ...

the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us\nSo Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigator what was that one catalysts that got you in doing\nOddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um\n'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids\nAnd my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they'd been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds a but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Callaway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude\nCame home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle Claude Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they\nWeren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later\nA claud was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nI'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no call and I'm a long story short my great uncle clogged Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe uh get David ... involved in the sun\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national park these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of the story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I verify the whole story with\nElderly people and a historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was the big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created and it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was when I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two wives\nWho trio let's go to the final call here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI Microsoft is November ... will go go ahead and I was one it was I if\nI Will also said yes how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kinda close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why\nTo Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise] but um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on\nWhich of course we now call Halloween\nIs built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church coming into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan believes into Christianity\nWith their own date\nWell November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't ... doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan\nAnd say instead of considering October thirty first um some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day and the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween\nAnd so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first and then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples or it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worship trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church has said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down\nAnd we punish them we're not going to win any friends instead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping\nWill just sort of morphed into our philosophy and so you see a similar um sin critic sort of attitude toward Halloween and that's why a salad one which is called Halloween by being the evening before the Halloween day\nJeff ... personal injury attorney aggressive experienced honest and fair seven seven for two two two two\nThere are bigger media

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread\nStories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows what else the civilians are enslave them\nScaring the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did invade\nThe are civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and now you know that's a documented piece of history just a terrifying uh\nA story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book is that a a group of tourists were at a peace museum near those cliffs and uh they were walking in the field near that that museum\nAnd they heard the sound of a what they considered they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything and then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams so that was pretty moving for me\nUm another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um\nHeartbreaking and he would Jima ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system are very interested\nTunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels so there's a story that I write about\nThat one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland in any\nWay he gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these are soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan\nTo those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the ghost don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying Dutch been the ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is a ... and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily did they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area\nNo well some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise]\nUh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about\nFifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway or and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a a for prop I'm an engineer to look like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they do what they thought yeah\nYou're right but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all there didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two it was a I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanic for the for the ... or or a half so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get from Hercules aircraft and something like a beat twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar and and there have been other\nWhat they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so to thousands Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear I Would how how they would leave\nIf\nThe one couple of just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right and\nThe reason I looked into the these are\nA ghost plane stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um\nThey went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or\nYou can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handled hundreds and we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories is\nThe ... website is no conveniently optimized for

and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight as well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes with strange ... Pearl Harbor is a hostage or not\nIt's extremely hard\nPearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nIt's a extremely haunted or according to a lot of the people that go there and uh many of the people tourists people who are interested in history go there\nAh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is\nEssentially a tune a mass grave 'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that uh\nHad been told about that a\nFamous area or are pretty extensive there's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona\n[noise] ah just briefly and then\nAh during that time where\nHe left the ship it was attacked in and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona and now rests\nA so that goes story has been told a quite a bit\nUm [noise] excuse me sure\nThere's also a story of a of all of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seemed to be faces in them into the picture is a\nVery uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks\nAnd hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it and the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they sit now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake\nSo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the Nazi hands or think leader [laughter]\nAnd some incredible things happened to him to you died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWas that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look to see if I could\nFind the the ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers or and or when Romney has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him uh I I thought he might be\nFound in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe\nOn the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a a\nArchitecture the development of the fortifications there are in the constructions of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patent a general Patton ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other\nGerman generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way that Stonewall Jackson maneuvered through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this story that uh\nIrwin ... haunt these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this I haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never have happened that\nThe German generals never came here are people who believed the story say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people who they are still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter\nAnd and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln and World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had to step down to the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to a visit with a\n... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other ah officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could ... Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill [laughter] you know\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting ... in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two\nLeaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two entities continue these hunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back the\nSomeone had completed the\nOf vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIt back in World War two actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nYeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out\nAnd and it's based on my research in my reading about that essentially the whole modern UFO UFO era starts in World War two with some of these sightings of these strange lights and objects that the American flyers used to just call a foo fighters\nAnd what stands out about these reports for me is just the quality of the observers because most of the people who witnessed\nThe corner of villa Maria at least twenty ninth and Brian across from the beach auto care\nThe interviews with newsmakers voted to return

Eric in Illinois Welcome to the show why Eric Europe with us\nToday they're in their mind control guy has everybody\nEverybody's fine he's a regular caller Matt don't worry don't be scared\n[laughter] years ago I was a listening to an audio and there was a video by the same name or on the Apollo Project and one of the things I remember uh\nHearing on the audio version that said when mercury seven astronaut or astronaut deep slight and died almost at the same time his plane was seen on the other side of the country like a ghost plane taken off\nAnd I didn't know the a guest it ever heard of that story for\n[noise] you know this is this is one of those cases so I I spend about two years ah\nResearching compiling and writing these stories and within the first couple of callers they all blew me away with with their stories\nI think I've heard about that that goes story I think I read an account of that but I I Can't be entirely certain\nMatthew since you've been doing these schools stories do new stories come to you all the time now\n[noise] I Do get a lot of news stories I get a lot of emails or when I'm when I'm On shows like this people will a message me off line and and give me great leads ah basically how I started with a more haunted rock and roll a was a just getting people sending me their own\nRoll a was a just getting people sending me their own accounts because it's hard to again when we talked about it\nThese these stories tend to be more oral there between people and they don't go on line so you know it's almost like I have like tens of thousands of reporters out there bringing stuff to me\nAnd I I assume the same thing is going to happen with a haunted World War two just like haunted rock and roll and and my ah a ghost stories about universities\nTo go to Leo in Phoenix first time caller force highly oh go ahead sir\nGood evening gentlemen I'd like you needed to a question on the um most ...\nI had an experience when I was listening Gettysburg\nWe were with this group and I went to this area uh in the building where I could take care of myself and I walked out\nThere was like he is horrible smell it was then ... there were men who were in costume I thought wearing costumes of the civil war\nAnd their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely saw they were just awfully awfully worried from the expressions and the smell or something that I had to get away from so I went back in\nAnd our guide caught me and said have you been and I said\nI just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour\nWhile while we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming those costumes are excellent so please explain to me how they were able to get that in ... that's now hideous melt and they all looked at each other and they said there isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these haunting Smith a there is a ...\nOf a sense with um with ah some of these haunting sand or\nFor instance the er when rumble um ghost story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so their their stories like that there are stories about people getting to a I think in the\nCase of the heck I'm a airbase there's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um\n[noise] ah articles uh after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of a I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost has meant drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be the Seventy seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor\nI guess there can't be many soldiers or seem in still left from the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenty they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these these stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um\n[noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nBrian in Indianapolis is with us She's still the Rockies good morning bright\nHey George how are you a great hope you are to me oh I'm at work again is all you're always working my God\nWell you know it's good for my four oh one K. my retirement\nPerfect and when you retire you still listen to

twelve minutes that twelve hundred men went in the water or know out of twelve hundred men\nEight hundred and eighty eight eight hundred and eighty name when in the water three hundred and went\nDown

last reunion here in Indianapolis 'cause it's so hard for them to get around like you said there are night\nOh yeah absolutely\nGuy and we always the guy remember the greatest generation they sacrificed for us and they did until but here I\nI was stationed in Germany are backing aide maybe one eighty three I took a day trip which in some ah\nFriends of mine ... concentration camp ha ha\nAnd you know it was more of a political prisoner camp it wasn't like an extermination camp you know like I'm the mother was were but we were we were able to take pictures or staff you know in and when we got here and when you as soon as you walk in the gate the pressure on you which just the norm you\nCould feel and imagine the of it but we took pictures you know and back then you had thirty five millimeter camera so you had to get you had to get them develop\nTwo weeks later we were going through the pictures that a couple of friends of mine had taken and just one picture out of the blue in the sequence of pictures was was that was kind of blurry but he took it down between\nThe barracks that are there and in ... in the ... strain silhouette these three we assume we were ... they were prisoners you you can either white\nGrossly go sleep prisoners will be back [noise]\nYou ... to ... dot com logo on [noise]\n\n\nAnd we are back with our final segment with Matthew swing the author of haunted World War two Matthew what conclusions have you come up with assuming you have about what's happening with all these stories and the tontines\nYeah the conclusions that's a that's a great question because\nI still feel I still consider myself a an open minded skeptic I'm not a cynical about this I keep open to these things [noise] I haven't really found anything that absolutely proves\nThat um you know these tales of the supernatural and haunted World War two are actually supernatural or whether there's natural explanations but on the other hand I have walked away saying that it can't\nYou know these things can't be supernatural I think they might also be supernatural so I'm Still maintaining my kind of on the fence about whether there's any conclusions about\nThis well they could be very natural or you know the ghosts and the spirits and the ... could be a very integral part of living and it's all mixed together\nRight I I mean the more you get into as a you know as a research writer and the more you get into [noise] looking at things like quantum physics and black hole and dark matter you realize I don't think we know as much as we think we know and I think there's a lot of territory\nThat could be explored and who knows whether we don't find that this is all in a related you know that's that's kind of what what keeps me uh keeps me going\nLet's go to the final calls now Monique in ... California is with us I'm Monique\nHi sailors a review\nHigh of ... thinking that might there having me on the show have you ever heard of\nMarilyn Monroe coming back there I have a short story I\nBecame that play about her in West Hollywood actor or am I kicked the air which we have a structure that I Believe it you know her World War two forty three and one particular Nightline man very late\nAbout to leave and he said he saw the lead\nActor on hey hey ho Kelly what are you doing here and then he realized that\nShe thought he was actually in the area of Marilyn Monroe or a women ate it and white she sat on it now you've ever heard something like that\nWas that you know actually that's kind of a fascinating a chapter that I didn't include\nA in haunted World War two and maybe I should of is really some of the ghost stories around a you know famous people who were maybe not involved in the actual fighting of the war but were involved in the war effort and I'm thinking about actresses I've never written anything about uh the ghosts of I'm\nMarilyn Monroe but I Know that when I was researching haunted rock and roll I Believe that her name came up in one of the places where Elvis was also seen so I Know there are a lot of good stories about Marilyn Monroe and and at\nVarious sites where where she a live ten where she performed so I I have heard of those I've never heard that story which is pretty fascinating\nHow would you love to interview the ghost of Marilyn Monroe and find out what the heck really happen to\nKnow the story she could tell oh my gosh\nYou know what the ghost probably would tell all the stories too yeah I'm not going to hold back this time\nAnd all those rumors probably were true mhm next ...
