so anyway we have a lot of like ... what else they put out their neck\nWhile exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July of polls here really don't matter a hill of beans\nI think however the polls now\nDo not so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winner but the polls today can\nBe highly influential and decisions and action taken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for ah for calling\nA ... and again for mentioning Bob Ford it really is one of the finest dies anybody could ever made [noise]\nAh I look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly experienced here at analyzing predicting understanding\nThe left and I know their mind set on many things one of their mindsets on power is that it's there's that that they are entitled to it and whatever it is denied them by way of elections they\nReally really resented and they resent the people who made it happen which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him\nAnd compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them the left is making every every effort it can\nTo distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office in the forest cabin all out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling and having lost that election and two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently\nEverything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump and it's been like ... you know spit balls\nThat you destroy Donald Trump and it's been like you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump I cannot tell you how frustrated they are\nIt is easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they ... they created a whole cloth something that did not exist a national\nAttitude of hatred for Donald Trump they simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump\nThat now that they've seen trumping action they hate him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became the narrative that's been the narrative for two years\nThat narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave that it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumping action they've seen is bad manners\nThey've seen whatever is about in the left taste now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody have a drop and everybody hated themselves were voting for him\nWell it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue wave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's\nAnd the blue wave in the house it's looking if he if he and now with Republican turnout dwarfing Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is where the Democrats get to run their fraud scheme slugs early voting is rubbing illegals vote\nAnd the debt vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans why it appears there are more sophisticated than Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans are showing up in drugs they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people\nAnother twenty five thousand

why\nThe American the left and the media have no idea who Donald Trump is and they can't even relate to it here's a guy who does nothing but love America and that is something they can't relate to loving America to them is old fashioned\nIt's a bygone era right in this era of globalism loving your company is fine but but it seems so old fashion\nAnd it's it's it's just past say it so\nIt's so foreign to these people they just there really isn't even a common ground with them\nOn that Donald Trump\nLet me share with the ... my brother David tweeted on this yesterday and it's probably a good way to say it he said\nTrump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist he doesn't speak in code he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even know what this stuff is when he says I'm a nationalist he's not winking\nAt neo Nazis he's not winking at white supremacists and saying we're patriots\nAnd UPC people he's just a guy who loves America he's a nationalist versus global list he's going to make America great again he believes America deserves to be great he believes America weeds in the world when it's great\nBut these people are but they're supposedly the intellectuals\nThere the broad minded people there are so small minded and tiny minded that they can't get past their hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reactions on Trump's has is a nationalist\nThey immediately hear a dog whistle yeah Trump's talking to the people in Charlottesville that's what they're thinking that Trump is winking at the people in Charlottesville the Nazis and there you go guys you go that's but they honestly think\nAnd if they don't honestly think that they're doing it doubled disturb us because they're trying to make people to follow them believe they do think that\nIf they do think that they're the ones I have an electoral problems if they do think if they cannot understand the simplicity of I Love America I Want America to be the best it can be America the best it can be makes the world the best if give if they don't understand that\nIf that doesn't compute with them than they have no business being positions of power in this country because they're not going to accurately represent us or destinations interest\n'cause this is not complicated it is such a cheap lazy reaction to say\nSee the Trump Hitler nationalist dog whistle\nNo basis in fact for it there's still\nEngaged in trying to convince Trump or are they convince people to hate Trump the way they do\nI'm just going to tell people\nYou you're ... if you don't learn to understand this you're going to ever be ... at the guy's ankles\nLoves America\nThinks America is great and can be grader and a great America is great for everybody in it and a great America is made great by great\nCitizens and that there's nothing wrong with loving America\nThere's nothing wrong with thinking America is exceptional and exceptional America solve the problems of the world and exceptional America creates an economy that is capable of providing prosperity for hundreds of millions of people there isn't another form of government that can even come close\nSocialism can't communism can't by definition at camp socialism communism produced wealth for the leaders by stealing it from the people who created\nAnd that's your Obama's and your Hillary's and pick any Democrat running for president in twenty twenty and a bunch of I'm running for reelection this time around but you people not understand how absolutely ... seat\nLazy if is to say\nThat the guy is simply trying to describe how he loves the country is a freaking Nazi you really think people are going to sign up with that and agree with that when there is not a sin pillar\nOf evidence\nYou guys are closer to Hitler and not to not see ism national socialism is a leftist movement you guys have much more in common with Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump ever going to hope that\nWe didn't start it will be happy to finish it rush a Mickey I be Mitt for\n...
