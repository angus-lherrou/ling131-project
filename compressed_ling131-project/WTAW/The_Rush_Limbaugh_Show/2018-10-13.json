I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is it's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that ah the president is teaching Republicans how to fight\nI actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like a loose and I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was\nWhat do you think would happen it 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats and the media\nInstead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what was the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh\nAnd safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in\nNumbers we haven't seen and who knows like since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a media and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixty and it got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here to Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points\nBack the Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor California is closer than he's running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the melt down that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come\nThey are so so certain\nThey're going to win this they've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nFor a total in six games so I mean a lot for than attempts so we shouldn't have to ... or whatever you don't be surprised to South Carolina goes forward up or down\n[laughter] those are they drove home loans dot com winning number so\nThey turn to something we already talked about every week are you going to offer something new and are twelve all blown dot com winning numbers\nI you know how old coaches used to say dance with who brought them I'm doing that today I've offered up a few different winning numbers throughout the season but for the year as a whole I'm always looking at red zone defense and I'm going right back to it today\nAnd what I mean by red zone defenses teams have a scoring chance when they get down there any way make that score a field goal or at least a field goal attempt don't let them get touchdowns when they get in the red zone looking at a and M. this year\nThirteen opponent trips into the red zone and those blows up scored a touchdown now that's better than I was a year ago right at sixty three percent\nBut it's not as good as what Mike algal our defensive\nCoordinators used to his past deep and could have been released out as far as keeping people out of the end zone\nOnce they get inside the twenty yard line so better than last year not as good as the Mike he'll go standard still need improvement and if you break it down guys [noise] am has really\nGotten the head of the game against the northwestern states and the ... of the world in this category the demons or the war hawks were just want to for as far scoring touchdowns are the rebels against the Aggies\nAnd then look at the higher end opponents Clinton's in Korea for ... three of three Arkansas one of one Kentucky only got into the red zone last week during overtime all you do is get five yards you get the red zone\nIn that game but they never had a snap and regulation across the yard line\nThat was incredible defense by the Aggies but I Am didn't well to keep Kentucky out of the end zone on that official red zone position in overtime and then we know that the field goal attempt hit the cross bar helping the Aggies win that game but it's got to be better about\nKeeping teams out of the end zone once they get inside the twenty yard line red zone defense that's what I'm looking at today\nYou guys are nothing if not consistent I Will say that so [laughter]\nSo of course I'm going to break the mold right\nNow I'm going to go with balance what's that that is that that's the\nDefinition of this team so the balance in water those ballots numbers you look at a time of possession this\nIs one of the best teams and all of the F. B. S. when it comes to a time of possession thirty five of the sixty minutes of football the all fences on the team twenty five minutes last week for Kentucky they ran just fifty plays forty\nSeven when you talk about regulation they had the three plays in the field goal attempt in the overtime also the balance of not just the number of runs and pass is also the yards can they have that balance the how are they picking up their yards\nIs it going to be a pass happy game is going to be a run happy game\nJumbo Fisher talks about the balance so I Will keep my eye on the balance numbers throughout this game and those are today's winning numbers brought you by twelve home loans dot com or twelve hundred dollars off your next home purchased or refinance\nLet Braxton Cheryl class about six and Eric our grade class about three give you the home team discount at twelve home loans dot com when we continue with the Texas a and M. football pre game show we will hear what Aggie players are talking about\nLast week's win against Kentucky and the challenge against South Carolina that's when we return Williams rice stadium best is Aggie football from we're field\nPlumbers local sixteen dreaming plumbers and apprentices in some plumbing systems from Houston to Bryan College station and almost to the Rio Grande\nValley mogul sixteen members are licensed by the state to in some money systems in hospitals schools in high rise buildings were the John needs to be done right in on time we'll go sixty eight apprentices complete a mind your classroom training program on working full time to obtain the experience necessary bridge dreaming license\nWhether you hire a woman for your business or your home gets a mess always end to see their license that's what you're paying for and that's what you should get\nHow do you become America's ... brand in the ... brand in Texas you offer more Julie Power awards for initial quality than any other automotive brand you offer innovative driver assist technologies like blind spot information and cross traffic alert and you offer\nTo cross the line of Fort Carson SUVs plus you offered tremendous savings from Texas ... great cash ... super low financially helping\nYou to be or best in Texas visit your best in Texas for dealers\nIs the best in\nHigh were cheered in ... but this late station here to share just a few of the many reasons we live our kept repeating adjustable it's perfect for reading in banks in watching football it's perfect for breakfast sitting back watching baseball it's perfect for a ... party ... like\nFor an idea and watching the Aggies like tonight the temper paid it could just double from the sleep station we can promise you'll love it we just can't guarantee it will be the same reasons\nNow it's two locations to serve you visit the sleep station dot com [noise]\nRemember the old adage that stage imitation is the best form of flattery well nothing rings true or even in the roofing industry ... the leader in all types of roof installations has trained many of his competitors\nSo when you need a solid bullet proof roofing contractor do a show the robot gives competitors did call ... roping at one eight hundred full roof or visit\nThem on the Web but she'll do not come\nDay of sound that I'm here in park gap traditions exceptional senior living I felt like\nI was on a trip all the Texas a and M. sports team because they stayed at some very nice hotels and you'll be blown away by what you see him find when you walk through the front door and they kept using the word community and that means family the hospitality service and care are oh man I'm Dave south and without reservation\nI'd recommend park and tradition senior living independent living assisted living memory care that's park out traditions dot com\nGet rid of the buses in noises given new HD Radio for your car and home and heroes with crystal clarity we're broadcasting an HD sixteen twenty WTO O.

more about you don't you\nWe do I mean we're we can compete a defense egg in that game I thought were outstanding special teams are really good and a lot of areas and that game I'll fencing moved the ball was gotta learn to finish drives but we are getting better\nYour defense Donovan Wilson open tackles if you don't make those it's a different game he was huge on the defensive and\nIt really was attacking us but we call it a lot of disruption in the backfield and we got a lot we got six taxing the gang which was tremendous stop the run but when the quarterback did break out of their ... their good players really broke out in the skilled players got out in space we Taco Bell in space and that was a key to keep him under under wraps\nCoach we talked about how um your your defensive line helps your secondary was the coverage in the secondary allow you to get some of those tax\nBoth I think we mix covered or that we had different zone looks I think you know make a doubt hold about just actually split second I thought at times it was rush it was a combination of all three\nSound like you're kind of war down Kentucky this team was in better shape when you got into overtime\nYeah I mean we we felt stronger ... at the end the game we kept playing great for the county don't often get people to run the football the last twenty five yard which is critical breaking package but we're physical scrimmage and that's one thing our kids are shown to our ability to compete late in gangs has been there\nWatching that last drive I'm watching the block by collie that frees trade beyond it was a it was a beautiful thing to watch because it was like a a a a symphony if you will everything had to work just radio\nWe got everybody down he kicked out the safety came up we're going to have a first down but then he broke that tack on top of that that that's the kind of the couch you on the line did their job to fall back that his job and into back does even more about breaking attack was so you know playing with physicality as is huge and that was a big part of that game\nWhen we go back to the uh Kentucky possession there a ... a huge because if not if you go may go through\nOh don't they definitely does I mean there are a lot closer to ... will make a ... and you know that's why you say you play a replay you don't know what's going to happen and we were fortunate there and keep you made a tremendous boy\nWas asking you earlier about identity and I think I may have been mistaken and just focusing on the fence but your defense can give a team and identity to ...\nOh no doubt your whole team has not been letting you either physical you're not it's not just physical one side of the ball and Hi how you practiced what you go against every day the way you set things up even your special team you're special teams have the physicality to them and they have to play that way and they have to be very competitive but the king the thing I'm happy about we're becoming more sound\nAnd all the things we're doing in our fundamental and be more consistent now we're still have a ways to go but we're getting better in that regard\nTalk about the special teams that's a huge pond returned by ...\nAm at big Machar cyber school but there was a others they're punter hit the ball well but he would just get a twelve year old return instead of starting to to twelve to twenty five twenty six thirty you know things like that make a big difference and play golf and here's the other thing are punter Brandon was outstanding but here's the other thing sometimes you can out punch your coverage we were making tackles\nWith no return so I mean that that on top of it and when you combine those two things that really makes an exceptional\nEspecially a college open field on Bouvier on at one point return right he just sold out and and knock them down\nAnd no doubt and give it back on the ... and that's where I was saying we were getting those tend to twelve Thirteen yard
