the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all of these house races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of them that are too close to call this is it in the bag for them\nBut they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up they've been on this blue way

elections\nThat approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\nWell didn't even get way and he wasn't on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year we're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democrat Party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that\nDonald Trump alone has provided the energy and the imposition of ... wake and the Democrats\nThe comeback show up and retake everything they lost all the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democrat Party\nDid much work bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the spending to energize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along ... there was nothing but Obama was doing the economy was a flat line\nIf it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did\nExcept they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component to that was on twelfth and now we're supposed to believe that that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties\nHas suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd its hatred for who Trump is its hatred for his tweets\nIt's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for each hairstyle it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited and what that and that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us all ... this massive Democrat blue

of a split is unusual we're all so I always says ... eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call up and your top ... forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd I might just for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous so she can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitted he's never seen a split like this he's talking about Democrats\nWinning the house Republicans winning the Senate he is never seen anything like that you have I don't know how to do that and we consider it a toss up it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's telling because he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen this election\nAnd he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can't analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea\nWhat's going to happen here you know he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around\nAnd their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had a split in the forecast like there's pretty unusual yeah a lot of\nThings wrong usual this time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand six team hasn't it\nTo predict this likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say uh wouldn't want any aid each one of his own and

that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous\nWe're now in the eighties twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really there's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two British is going to be wrong [laughter]\nWell there is a pretty good indication of Democrats are not going to win the Senate\nAnd he's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how he doesn't know he's nervous as analysts are telling you it's eighty twenty
