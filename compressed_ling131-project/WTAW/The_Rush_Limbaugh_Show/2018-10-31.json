here at the synagogue shooter have at Trump considered Trump a sellout\nPrecisely because he has a daughter to convert to Judaism that's not mentioned no Trump is ratcheting down he is he's a Hitler pedaled through the metal and here's the opinion of David ...\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma say I'm Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of making you know beat the drums or to go out and and stock the terrorists all around the country and tried to heal and it was a turning point as president say he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turned his presence around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision as works\nThere David ... saying that Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the\nTerrorist\nHe didn't start in America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWell\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that by their very words that violence is acceptable\nYou ought to see you I'm sure you are now seeing the reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who couldn't even talk about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the blogosphere and\nMeet some of the airwaves or this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nAt the White House felt some have had an issue of corrections and all we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network vessel we meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in Campbell gear\nAnd the media has a video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this you get right up but there's Clinton zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me bombed out somebody said Clinton he didn't do that no he was trying to heal\nHe didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums in stark jealous of all of them he tried to heal it was a turning this is\nAgain history revision is an extraordinary one more by this is Wolf Blitzer asked\nAnd judge Jeffrey tube and\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI was the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was president he went to Oklahoma City was delivered a beautiful speech and it was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on jeopardy you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places\nIn a in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occurred to me that there would have been protests\nSee so now there were no protest for a bomb and there was no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nThat Trump's guilty But Trump's at fault but the protestors are right why weren't there any protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely me cause no left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three years ago and it it it was a much quieter and different time it was\nJust getting ratcheted up to where we're headed in any way I got to take a break

the caravan might be the two big issues that they have a GOP\nNow I I haven't seen the specific Senator Grassley is quote unquote report so I don't know if you use the phraseology save a GOP or if that is the media\nAs they are interpreting and reporting\nOn um on on a ...\n... words are but if it's if it's Grassley save the geo ... that would that would indicate that grass lately I really don't want to go there I don't want to assume Grassley said until I have what he actually said I'm not going to even speculated\nThough the way the media is reporting on of his save the GOP means it was over and we were I mean we were headed for the gigantic will way we're going to lose everything and then the cabin all thing happened in a caravan thing I might save a GOP\nOr other people saying

and the synagogue murders in Pittsburgh and that would have just destroyed any momentum I yeah I Love people in Washington and they're conventional wisdom okay so they are sitting there their

everybody does it to a certain extent\nAnd so they get all have to try to about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter\nAnd then they said that Kavanaugh's situation the Democrats blew that sky high it as a whole man this is really gonna help of been the pipe bomb in the Senate guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their

reasons and I just I I'm Sorry I don't buy it I think people can feel that in Washington\nIf your day is the news and your everyday you're talking about the caravan of you're talking about ... a cabin on the aftermath and the impact that that might have on the midterms in all of a sudden you stop talking about that because to other stories pop up then yeah you could if you're reporting and in the

Kavanaugh if the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why isn't justice not being sought any longer\nAnd the answer the question is it was never about the women because none of the

horse and buggy days and no electricity\nManned spaceflight landing on the motives saw it all\nAnd I remember I was I was home in Missouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after the program again so they Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety Days in a club close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big things it was hard of hearing but it's not just couldn't here to radio easily one of the big things being discussed on your program say immigration\nWe called him pop\nPop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know\nI remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days of Ellis Island you you immigration has been\nA polarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nEfforts to him up soon\nNew arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe ever people as his point was the arguments haven't changed\nThe issue has been something that is Constance but the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal\nImmigration he was saying back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundred the controversy then it was about legal immigration I mean even with legal immigration there were people opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity that come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what extent of the day the differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed\nAnd we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and take and what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so\nIn liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be poor out there\nAnd so therefore the American people are guilty of something\nThere was an unequal distribution of wealth the laps as in all of these countries in Central America and South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion and the real purpose behind it\nIs to transform America into the kinds of nation that was never intended are found it to be and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening\nThe
