to and if you want to send an email I checked the rush ball FBI being done us [noise]\nOkay so the FBI report was delivered [noise]\nChuck Grassley Grassley\nSaid hey there's nothing new witness everything in this we knew which was eminently predictable\nThey still haven't the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset folks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate walls he forged\nAnd ... that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate balls the forge testimony\nThey weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate\nA sweat make they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the sevens FBI investigation into Brad cabin on\nThe left us out there but they didn't talk to Dr Farida and it didn't turn thing Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testified under oath\nWhat more can the FBI or do you think the FBI really thinks these people don't change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that Dr forged testimony changed anyway and in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or cabinet ... ... talk that Kavanaugh for how many times from we're having a years\nUm but they testified under oath and so the the thing is no reason to talk to them and go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying that I couldn't find any\nSo I'm watching CNN did I've got CNN and Fox on it in here and it was probably ten minutes ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they've lost it gives us a little CNN report it only looks a little to me\nHe was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this is very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today\nActually sounded like a Republican\nAnd that presents a problem\nJeff Flake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough\nReport and investigation\nSo it looks like flake and Collins or in line to vote has been called cloture vote was fire last night by by the turtle who was on fire again today just moments ago on the floor of the Senate up for him he was on fire\nAnd we have the audio soundbites of this coming up I'm Still waiting for James Comey has anybody heard\nNow I'm so this this is happening and they only primary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it\nI've even seen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\n... well we will ah will see about that but\nClearly there is a reaction is and and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is\nSo easily understood\nIt is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people\nYou know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people a day that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton\nRan the operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got booed because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people are not live to Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this was their first\nAnd that means it is the worst smear campaign\nEver that they've seen to anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared\nWe think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence\nHe'd been vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived when you boil all this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats\nSenate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes urging recalcitrant Republicans are going ahead and vote for capital as a way this is backfiring on them\n\nDon't know that it's a wild guess and only time will tell when we get to the vote but\nThe FBI investigation at the Democrats want it appears to have provided\nThe FBI

they're coming out then they they're depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy and stone faced their shell shocked there or something or other\nNow why would that be\nWhy well\nDid the Democrats on that committee\nActually believe Christine Ford\nDid they really believe what she was saying\nThat I don't know how anybody could\nHonestly folks without an I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't\nRemember where when why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although for did the Democrats and that can be really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nomination\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they know that there's nothing other than the way this is all this has managed to all they've got\nIf they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations and countless other interviews and\nWritten questions haven't produced\nWell that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but\nI thought this has been a scam from the get go and that they're all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter\nDetailing all of this\nSo they walk out of ... office and they're all stone faced\nMaybe they thought that they had flake and maybe they thought they were gonna get Collins Collins inflate of come out and what they have said\nSo far remembered the votes not going to be they'll Saturday now so anything can change\nDo not think the Democrats have scrape the bottom of the barrel or the gutter\nAnd the efforts to force this they've still got so Saturday\nNumerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally\nSouth haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\n\nThat he is doing this it truly is\nMr Sassaman gets the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has\nA behavioral patterns of strategic ... it's called pacing\nAnd really briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford what did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's ally ... gone Trump's and all of this and everybody's a wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual\nTrump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved the Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic\nMaybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light\nParis climate accord yeah yeah there may be somebody here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue as seemed to dubbed tail with what the swamp things but then a few days or are we go by him\nAnd the president's becomes who he is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of way she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford\nHe knew right off the bat\nThat she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove\nAnd what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEvery body because of what Trump dead at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff\nOn Dr forge shaky uncorroborated provable test them on to the drive by us we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys\nWere not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nBut because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said\nIn the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the papers the papers on my got Trump is always uses horrible because it is it your main he's not fifth of what Donald Trump did\nRick counting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony\nDonald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\nReporters are now asking senators in the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony that drive by media did not report on on ... none of the cooperation being possible they did not tell their audiences that the foreign people foreign place\nIn the room when her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nBut people watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying the people that watch the mainstream media had no idea\nThat the foreign witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of them are good friends\nThe drive by us we're not reporting any of that the dry buys were reporting what the Democrats senators\nI Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital was guilty\nSo Trump goes out\nTells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't always she got home she gets it on the record to drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard look at it this way sync up with the millions of people who had never heard the truth\nAbout Dr Christine Ford and her full of holes testimony think about millions had never heard it until Trump went out\nAnd characterize that for everybody\nThink of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri\nIn Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia and North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\nWouldn't have known the truth had Trump not\nDetailed it for people in his rally\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses\nThis is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people these protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel\nThey don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democrats senators haven't told them only Trump did another reason why they hate it\nBut we don't have an honest meaty\nAnd sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine Blasey Ford story now they do and here's a little cherry on top\nSince Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying no corroboration for what Dr Ford said\nSo Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump or his goal literally insane\nBut if Trump hadn't set it and nobody would know at the Trump did say it millions now do know it and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report\nWe couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democrat senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally\nIt's not like he's lucky\nAnd stumbled into this stuff\nThis is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his

it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts\nAnd six New Testament eat pistols as the introductory guide here to get people who want to read the Bible butter intimidated by it\nTo actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start\nAnd you'll be more likely to stay with it\nIt details the suffering and the sorrow the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures\nIn Christianity following the death and resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which\nIf the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity\nDoesn't exist and and that's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically\nPut your arms around that\nResurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any\nNames liberal talk show host really berating a Christian you really believe that camp you that's why you people are not you can't really think that somebody died came back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell for Christianity to be what it is that had to happen\nAnd my brother David is\nA devoted to helping people believe that has happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it look it's it's not simply a primer it's its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nBe sort of like an introduction\nTo the Bible and to Christianity\nBoth test them it's but this focus was on the book of acts because that's where it all is now don't just read the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the
