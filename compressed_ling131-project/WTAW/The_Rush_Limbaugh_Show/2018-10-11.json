to the White House and then had him on air force one flew him around and got off the airplane with him so they have a good working relationship\nThe president still will not declassify documents that Devon known is in a number of other people want the classified which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup and who really started it and when and where and all of that\nAnd the president said I talked to Rosenstein and frankly told Fox News today in the morning on a phone I've I I don't understand why he won't tell people I had a great conversation where there are some things he told me that need to be under oath\nSo the drivers are confused just Trump talked to Rosenstein Rosenstein told Trump everything you wanted to know Trump says I don't see anything wrong with it but then roses and I won't go up and talk to Congress in Trump's not making him do it so people can't figure out what's going on\nLet me tell you how to observe this or how to deal with trust the

dismembered and taken out of there in various diplomatic pouches and will never be seen again\nThis is why the president others are being urged to get involved to find out what happened because we have an allied relationship with the Saudis and we cannot tolerate this if this is how the Saudis are going to treat their journalists\nNow the relationship we have a Saudi Arabia always has been very little leverage they've got an oil we didn't have as much as we needed we needed to buy theirs we needed them to stay friends we needed them to have a a open ended relationship with us as such we treated them with kid gloves we protected them they left us a bill to base\nA air force base we protected them it was kind of a mutual back scratch\nA relationship but now it's changed because we

[laughter] ... well\nWe were we were young adults in the nineties so I'm In my mid forties\nOkay All right fine so your job and your next step up from ...\nYes and my entire adult working life has been in an economy in decline and not only have you which has been a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years\nBut Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been in the public eye and in

want to gloss over I Want to return back\nTo be a primary point you've made that you are in your mid forties I'm for the first time in your life your living through a growing\nPositive economy that prior to now your entire life has been lived in a either a flat line or a shrinking economy\nYeah pardon no let's not forget something for most of that time in the last\nEight years prior to Trump people like you were also told that this was as good as it going to get that you had to one count and acknowledge that there was a new normal now\nAnd that America's great days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and and this this was more like the way it's going to be now so you were also told not only were you in a flat lining economy you weren't told don't have any lofty expectations here right\n... exactly now how let's jump forward to this growing autonomy my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick\nAre you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living it and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI I'm In a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I Am aware of it the ah\nInformation but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I'm I Know that is true that it's that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life and and\nI literally feel like the finances in America there's been a stranglehold on it as a depletion of it\nI mean I'm old enough to remember sitting around the table and my parents saying you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place\nAnd has done in a span and just the you know Twenty years it's boomed am I happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world struggling and and and not have what they need to survive but on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management and our government that has a link to all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you've talked about the opioid epidemic I can and and all of these you know these the fruit the fruit of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is you're you're you're living in a ...\nThey were going to have other problems exactly right\nBut the point is you're you're you're living economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because people want to act like a well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later oh hey real yeah\nOh that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject watery lottery winners what becomes of um [noise]\nYou're absolutely right I just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it manage real did you that it's not just the result of me or people like me telling you that things are good that\nMatters just one thing\nMy mom also told me Christine to eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China but I wasn't smart enough\nI was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said mom you're telling me that if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China are going to be rubbing their stomachs as a boy it feels good to be full\nAnd she called me a smart alec and told me the stops asking her but she
