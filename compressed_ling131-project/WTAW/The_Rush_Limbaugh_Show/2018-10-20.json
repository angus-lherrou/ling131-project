right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male it's has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit of improved\nAfter the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats\nAnd all of these house races the Democrats are showing their voters are locks they're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of them are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them\nBut they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base and they can't do that\nBut folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here very briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats\nBetween two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen they continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them the last elections\nThat approach what's coming up we're the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\n... when he was on the ballot or the the um\nThe midterms in in that year we're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties and from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\n\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... wake and the Democrats the comeback show up and retake everything they lost well the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those mid terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democratic party\nDid much work bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the spending that energized but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along ... there was nothing was Obama was doing the economy was a flat line\nIf it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians he was giving away guns the Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component\nDevelopment twelve so now we're supposed to believe that that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand to the Nineteen twenties\nHas suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump and a hatred for who Trump is its hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaved\nIt's hatred for each hairstyle it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited what\nThat and that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us all gr this massive Democrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave plus Trump is uniting the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver by here\nFrom the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict\nThe likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone in both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like\nThere's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater so almost a toss up that you'll have one of these for\nRecall something ... forty percent or greater almost a toss up and you'll have one of these forecasts killing like this for you\nLet me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he can be he's sweating bullets there is a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitted he's never seen a split like this he's talking about Democrats\nWinning the house Republicans winning the Senate he is never seen anything like that you know I I don't know how to do that and we consider it a toss up it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's tell I guess he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen this election\nAnd he's very nervous over to the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here no he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the time of the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns\nWhen they start throwing their numbers around and their percentages and stuff but let me just don't think there's very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had to split the forecast like this pretty unusual yeah a lot of things wrong\nUsual this time aren't they need to be like usual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it to predict this likelihood of a ... with this unusual we um\nYou know I always say when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone in both places that makes me nervous meaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to ... I mean it makes me nervous\nWe're now in the eighty twenties on both sides of this\nRemember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really there's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance at one of those two British as it could be wrong\nWell there is a pretty good indication that Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how\nHe doesn't know he's nervous is\nAnalyst says telling you it's eighty twenty both sides but they don't know it's fifty fifty fifty fifty you might not even show up and go to work books that all all of your analysis and all of your data collection produces it could go either way it why is anybody paying you\nRush Limbaugh going the way home to eat I eat more\nCyber criminals cyber bad guy is going to attack your laptop your tablet your smartphone without you even knowing or they can steal your identity and you may not realize it until it's too late that's why lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of Norton Security to help protect your identity and your devices\nLifelike uses proprietary technology to help detect a range of threats to your identity in Norton Security protects against online threats\nLike ransomware or malware and if there is a problem lifelike with Norton has agents will work to fix now no one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor transactions and all businesses but\nNew life like with Norton Security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats gonna lifelike dot com recall eight hundred and four forty forty eight thirty three years the ... code rush for an additional ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with and you will that Roman terms apply\nThey say he was killed in a fight so I'm ...

us for our pre game visit with co ... for Dora as we get ready for this afternoon to match up with the Katie pay out Panthers from the newest highschool stadium in Texas\nLegacy stadium and Katie I'm Mark green sitting in for ... last week the tigers beat the then undefeated Lamar consolidated must thanks thirty four to twenty eight\n... Lamar came in undefeated and do the teams they play didn't have a very impressive combined record they certainly lived up to their five and a record never giving up against the tigers\nThough you know I was very impressed with him they had some great athletes on the field and did some things but you know I was very proud of our kids we fought the whole way through and uh you know we made some mistakes but we fix them at half time like we always say it's all about the W. come away with the wind and that's most important\nThing where there's no scoring and the first quarter and they obviously dominated time a possession what was Lamar doing to keep the you're off into\nThe field I think the big thing they like to do is they like milk and the clock and just getting no's a yard at you know there was a lot of times they would get\nA second and six and a third and three and kept going on it and doing things but you know overall they had a power running back you know our defense coaches were upset the one time we had them in a big stop and the kid just carried to the whole group you know another Fifteen yard for first down but\nYou know like we tell a God you got to be prepared for anything and everything they're undefeated and you know it was going into this game knowing that if they beat us and they're going to be ahead of us and district but now we're headed him and district ... what\nWere they doing defensively to keep the pressure on Kate and I are the the thing that struck me was there were four sex in the game and what was there pressure up front on the line and was it a case of well covered receivers or was caving in boys are just absolutely nowhere to go with the football because of the defensive back for\nA couple of times we get out of pocket a little bit too soon because we had a you know sealed in side but you know it was just one of those deals they were doing different things up front they had one good defensive tackle that had a lot of push and he was getting off a block sometimes but\nYou know overall I thought you know our guys did a decent job we were able to do some things but like we always talk about their science we got to get better at two goals we had in his ... year long scorn in the first possession ... and have a no turnovers that some we got to get fixed but you know it's like I told her kids right now we're leading the district ... and we're\nPretty been pretty balanced we've got a thousand Ninety four Russian yard fourteen hundred and Eighteen passing\nYards were average him for a team but those are great stats when you look at it but it ain't great when you get to turnovers and not scorn and first possession each asked why\nDo we talk to a couple of weeks ago specifically about several of the athletes on the football team it seems like\nYou guys are very loaded with good athletes unskilled positions and even off into line defense alone that sort of thing but\n... a name that we call it a lot this year ... had a very breakout gain this week very talented athlete talk a little bit about what was special about his performance in what he brought against Lamar\nBut I think the diamond stands out about ... as you know we went to him and I talked to him\nYou know last week and said hey we may run you at some tell back and stuff he said go job do whatever it takes and he's a power running back you can see like big plays out of backfield great thing is in you know when Julius our it's in their tail back we throw him out of receiver and he's making big plays out receiver and I think all that shows is that we got talent everywhere and a lot of depth in that and that's a big help for us but\nI'm very proud of brown ... to better just jump around me any position and play and understand it\nAnd that just makes you see what type of player he can be at the next level\nWell it's good because it to your point it gives Julius around much needed rest he's kind of carrying the load at the running back right now but you also run to the wildcat with Nate Floyd back there he gives you a lot of different options\nIn to that point talk a little bit about Julian Howard ... yard run I Know probably in your Twenty years of coaching you don't see very many of those what was special about that play\nHow did the stars lined up what caused that break out\nWell they were kind of low in the box inside so that's why we put the outside stretch and it started with our land they did a great job but then are full back did a great job coming out of backfill picking up the linebacker named Julia is just showed his faith he got to the outside and turned it on and very proud of them having a big run like that you know\nA ... yard run that was a kind of turning point in the game and ah you know I liked ... just kept his head into it and kept fight and then going all the way through to the end zone and finishing off as a gray Ron\nI've got to think on on tape or or or on film that preparing for a little more consolidated that being such a young team that they probably came out better prepared than what she had anticipated\nWell we went in looking at their film and they were running a certain defense in plain pure man up in your face all deal but then against us they didn't do that it was a whole different change and that's why\nI think when we got in at halftime we were able to make the adjustments and then we start hurting more in the run game in passing game but I was very proud of our guys 'cause I tell them you never know what a defense is going to do you prepare what you see on film but you got to be ready for changes and they had changes in our guys adjusted did a good job\nComing out in the second half you you guys had deferred so you were you receive the kick they kick off a course they bought the ball down they start to time you got to take a timeout is that what the cause of the time out was as you are running out of time or did you see something you wanted to take advantage of\nWell it was two things one thing we've got to do a better job of and I'll take the blame on that as a coach you know that's the new rule you ... put in and starting to play clock early we got to have to play ready and we got to get on the field and be ready to go but\nLike I tell my quarterbacks clocks running you've got to be ready to go now Darby all met on this we had a play called and he was confused what he was doing and and when we saw that they\nHad lined up in a different look that we're one that's why we took the time out to go ahead and get adjusted I Know a lot of people don't want a waste of time out but I don't want to sit there and have a first and Fifteen and like we've done last couple of weeks so we use the time out and were able to adjust to it we'll\nTalk a little bit about your special teams how did you feel like I Know you've made some adjustments over the weeks\nAnd I didn't look to board on the way in so I don't know how they pay grade it out this week but special teams uh talk a little bit and and I like to give you the opportunity to give kudos to those are deserved after watching film watching the game that sort of thing so as we wrap up here before we turn to page talk a little bit about a special teams talk a little bit about the guys that really did outstanding jobs last week\nThought we did a great job and our special teams beyond what we got every goal except one way or that one miss extra point and called him my body will tell you that's his fault and you know the thing is he doesn't let that getting his head um you know that's a goal that we always want to achieve because\nYou know like I'm at one point the giants game present they get that on side and they go in and scored they can win the game by one so you know those are things but I thought we did a good job in his kicking on the kickoffs and stuff and we had pretty good coverage and we got every goal and that's a big plus when you get five out of your six bills but like our kids will tell you they're not happy ...\nAnd that's a big plus when you get five out of your six goals but like our kids will tell you they're not happy because they didn't get all ...\nIt's time to take a break and when we return we'll turn to page to this week's game against the K T pay tile Panthers you're listening to him consolidated tiger football\nWhen
