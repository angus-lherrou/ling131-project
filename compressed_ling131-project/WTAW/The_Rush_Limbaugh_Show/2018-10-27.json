He was on today with the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us\nWhat you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the morning\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take is ... from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think sixteen after Bon Jovi as gangs came across\nThe border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and innings me stop\nAnd Louis continued\nTo close the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims\nAnd basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from and also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the the ... I talked to Louis he'll talk about Japanese talking to Jeff and I don't even know who is probably who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great\nPoints they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here\nBut of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left I think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave\nWhat we're being told right now is the six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls that the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing trumpeter Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousand sexy germs the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't\nBelieve it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began\nTo look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN zone poet forty four percent Rasmussen his trumpet\nFifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests\nSay blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI eat election day people have to start reeling in news mad cat productions and projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all that's the case who hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little man it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house with a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold outs\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get the poll result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide\nTo put in your sample there is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more\nIllegal immigration the American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party to stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never been there\nThe Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGo do your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\n\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression there's a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea of these are so\nPoor people there there's the hungry we'd we we have so much they have so little we know what the that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump would never gotten the Republican nomination if the people of this country wanted mobs\nOf seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump would have never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them in we shouldn't feed them we shouldn't house then they have nothing there toward are coming from ... countries let them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe media is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the\nBorder and yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy\nHere and that's just not where the

really\nHis tweets here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again beep\nAnd be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose there is a translation for this in addition to what he's saying here you'd Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump just to oppose Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources\nThat Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true then Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people on our side of jumped St George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us\nA mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in that doesn't help us whatever now do you see all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out\nThe way it was planned no blue wave I ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but I I don't think they're going to [noise]\nI I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groups think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now that argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat and I even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets is a bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying cabin on his family sending rice in what\nLooked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society standard good old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture and leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media were under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republican\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the church or not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario what sense does it\nMake for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and they're going to be discovered\nDoesn't make any sense\nAny way shape or form a yup break time back with more after this\nHang on Russia's always at work but he I have\nNever
