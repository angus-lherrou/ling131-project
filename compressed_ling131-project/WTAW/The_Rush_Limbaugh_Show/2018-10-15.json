years ago this is Leslie stall interviewing CIA interrogator hosts said about religious she says some college should Mohammed was subject to waterboarding specifically one\nHundred eighty three pouring water about a half dozen separate sessions Jose Rodriguez of the average pouring lasted ten seconds\nWe not have somebody twenty five\n[noise] do we have number twenty six to somebody number twenty six play just give it okay well so much for that um what\nJose Rodriguez says it missed by can I say something about college that Mohammed he's the one that was responsible for the death of Danny Pearl the wall street reporter he slit his throat in front of a camera I don't know what type of man it takes to cut the throat of somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably were ranch rear end about having waterboarding his base\nHe never believe for a second year we're going to kill it no let me tell you he will use his fingers to count the number of seconds because he knew that in all likelihood we would stop at ten is doesn't sound like a person Who's Afraid of dying\nLeslie stall says so what happens the breakdown does he cried dizzy fall apart no he gets a good night's sleep you get to ensure by\nThe way it was very heavy when he came to us he lost fifty pounds was at least all watch his insure you mean like people in a hospital drink that stuff yes dietary manipulation was part of our dire techniques\nYou totally mocking her Leslie stall so\nSleep deprivation dietary manipulation ministers are well yourself the u._s. doesn't do that\nWill say Rodriguez well we do it would've been a perfect\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ...\nOurselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises which say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that\nI don't know how big of a scoring point that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it already ... says he's going to do something he's going to do or die trying we don't have a wall yet but not for lack of trying\nAnd we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying other Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read burst issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of\nA sudden Trump wants to once again take away health insurance from people with preexisting conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican wants this is the reason the Republicans didn't go on for a full repeal of Obamacare as pre existing conditions\nWhich you get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being covered just not even insurance there's no way you can get insurance if your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell your insurance wants the houses on wire or after it's been robbed so we're not even talking about insurance but we are\nAs far as the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house in the Senate\nWants to take away health insurance or preexisting conditions when did this happen no Republicans out there saying that\nIt's sort of like when Joe ... a ... at the doorstep of novels was interviewing 'em a while questioning Mitt Romney in a debate\nAnd he asked and you think the states should be able to ban contraception\nRomney look the rest of what nobody's talking about that stuff and I I don't care for that he's talking about I Wonder when you think should state senator right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what\nWe're not talking about George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling\nYou in the states will eventually Romney answered it and it didn't matter what the answer was\nIt allowed the media Romney\nDiscusses states banning contraception\n[laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women\nWas reborn and that's what this preexisting condition garbage let me see what the real issue with the real\nIssue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about is immigration illegal immigration that remains\nThe issue that color lessons\nRevolt Republican voters no matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested in terms of being a very helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it after ...\nThey're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions Leslie stall here is trying to\nDo the same thing by suggesting that\nTrump is hostile to our good friends in Europe and just do sound so hostile why would you want to sound so hostile it's like when she was talking to Jose Jose Rodriguez why when you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so mean that's not who we are still you're so hostile and Trump said what is hostile\nThe way they treat us is what's hostile we're not hostile\nShe says yeah but you can't deal with it without he says we have been the stupid country for so many years\nAnd that you find that you're willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO\nYou know what else they said in his interview secretary\nOf defense Mattis came up Trump's that I Know more about NATO than Madison does [noise] [laughter] [noise] I don't work man is as far as the deep state is concerned as NATO\nAny army general would be nice though Trump\nJust [noise]\nAs Vanity Fair magazine says and it's surprising admission sixty minutes\nWas out matched by Trump the president talked over Leslie stall and embrace let loose blaster Miranda rights which seemed more rally an interview\nLeslie stall will not be happy in Vanity Fair they all live for puff pieces in Vanity Fair particularly news people 'cause enemy fair\nYou know is is Hollywood star celebrity mecca magazine\nAnd if you get mentioned Vanity Fair\nEurope dumb massive crossover you've crossed over from news do entertainment\nSupposedly doing both not to be just my Vanity Fair that's not a bullet point that's not a resume enhance or\nMinutes aired an interview with Trump rare for its status as having appeared outside of Fox News or conservative media appearing the same weekend as first lady millennia\nOutside of Fox News or conservative media appearing the same weekend as first lady Melania Trump on twenty twenty this would seem to represent a new level of media blitz seeing on the part of it administrators shouldn't it's already seen its head get plenty of free promotion during rallies broadcast on cable news\nAnyway they go on to trash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them to just continue to dominate with real\nLint lists rhetoric CBS let Trump get away with the same kind of persona and the same kind of stuff that he says as he says\nAt his rallies they say Leslie stalls interview with Trump was an undeniable get\n\nHe'd been scarce on mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt at NBC and indicated he'd fired call me in part due to the Russia investigation but the interview seemed governed by two motives both of which played in the hands of a media savvy president\nWho's refusal to play by typical rules of engagement has been at the center of his rise you know people in the meeting and say oh you want he's been the most\nMedia accessible president you've ever had this guy will stop and talk to your wherever your gathered if he's on the way somewhere and sees you he stops in talks to you and he tells you exactly\nWhat he thinks it's not his fault if you can't keep up with it it's not his fault if you can't play your usual journalists games and dominate him and get away with re characterizing what he says looks like or thinks\nVanity Fair is just admitting ... very very frustrated\nThat they can't treat Trump successfully the way they treat all other Republicans they want to get rid of\nYou know

Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want an end did you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice forming into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation are actual report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station controversy that was all part of the global warming craze\nIn the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ...\nAt our founding\nThe left went fatty they said I was insane that\nCouldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chop down trees and we haven't replaced them to make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed\nOut to people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is\nThe wood industry they need ... right I didn't get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree to cut down for a new ones are planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forest an acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever it and that's that was trees that were gone forever why they don't want to cut down the redwoods will never come back you know I'm the same token\nI remember saying it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees\nForested acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out that are falling ice from a\nGlacier or light green is going to raise in sea level I sent as like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes\nBeing jumped into the ocean and not going to raise ... you're crazy it's crazy it's ... you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise ...\nNo it doesn't get a glass eyes and pour some water in it filled up Philip Glass in ice put as much ice in there as you can and filled up with water I still going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\n... well not the volume is\nThat's ... ... well not\nThe volume is the volume a bunch of ice chunks falling off a\nGlacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about that but you know what your throat where you're not a scientist you can't say that\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing and if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland melt and have the ice follow your what would you do to make that happen to think about what\nWould you do Russia's always at work he

there but um\nI wanted to I I I just want to portray how ... and it was is they were very very powerful movie you're going to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff but this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now\nAfter that after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated they're\nOkay I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it go\nAbout what but but what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period\nEven if you think you didn't know what about\nThe movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was on my ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe what what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over ... was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but\nEven more than that what was that the why ... what was the barbarian and what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no in God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill him\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by snooping there spinal cords with scissors\nNow I didn't save is on friday\nI didn't say this on friday about gods now but what he did because I didn't want to frightened people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director lets the story tell itself there aren't any\nExaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lotta a special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less whether you're done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what yet revealed\n\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a A N across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling it and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one did they wouldn't allow any\nWas Facebook would not allow any kind of a a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a lot of was the amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a a lot of hard work and a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nIt was a real challenge for maybe ... how difficult is it\nTo focus on the fact that this abortion is did his murderous work outside the womb\nThe fact that this ... did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of uh of abortions in the ... but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning you know everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion\nAnd it's called an abortion if you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is ... in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called\nAnd abortion and\nThe the the the the the thing the leftist tried to do encountering this movie is to say well well if you want more God's know then you go and overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing what he was\nDoing because women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get\nThat's a flat out why by the way ... clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that were getting sick and infected with it just it was a big stars in Philadelphia\nBut I did lose focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to you because you don't see it\nThat's my point they don't graphically try to make their points they focus on the murder trial but\nGood going out there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating and nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what it what about him but he got that's not that I wanted to hear anything but that is what I think most people will learn that they didn't know if they go\nTo in the mainstream American Beauty adjustable Russia but he I beat Mitt word\nBuying a home allows you to benefit from appreciation in home prices and his

independence and they're interpreting this was meaning that the country is finally had it with Trump finally fed up with Trump and of course by association the Republican\nAnd then met Paul started focusing on health care and well another poll on the health care and and specifically pre existing conditions\nAnd the Democrats saw that the health care has become a major issue in polling data so they are reviving the idea that Republicans want to take away\nEverybody's insurance people who have preexisting conditions Republicans want to take it away it's nothing could be further from the truth\nRepublicans don't want to take it away but I I could in any other period of the year and make the case that it's not even insurance is not not be discussed in terms of health insurance because ensuring people\nAfter they're diagnosed specifically with a terminal disease whatever you do form it's not insurance\nBut it doesn't matter because we live in an era where health insurance means somebody else pays for it\nAnd if you\nNot going to walk out and have somebody else pay for it simply because you've already got a disease that you're going to think it's unfair and you're going to an

to hear you and they're going to champion the cause of\nPre existing conditions I'll tell you a little secret Obamacare set up a separate funding mechanism for pre existing conditions and it required people with preexisting conditions to register in a pool\nBecause it is an insurance it was a separate funding pool it was a separate way that people were going to be treated or or helped if they had a pre existing conditions but it wasn't technically insurance\nAnd then the noteworthy thing about it was how few people signed up for that pool\nWell that's absolutely be asked Trump proves that
