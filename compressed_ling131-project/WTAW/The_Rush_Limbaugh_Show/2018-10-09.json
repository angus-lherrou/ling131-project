mind\nYeah she was a way [noise] um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up in states of the union speeches having sort of a little more time to get through the night why she is seen falling asleep at the court says there's nothing wrong with that uh I'm\nElena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states will start to hear an audio soundbites seven he has apologized and be cabin on on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in\nYou follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach capital other openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the power capital has asked the fifth so called conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this isn't anywhere over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I'm telling you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president what would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles\nI Can't think of one who would do it and it's just as important the Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained\nTo the American people what the American media had not told them\nWhen he recites the essence of her testimony\nAnd with a drive by that that he was mocking Dr balls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them\nThat she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where about ... she didn't know how she got home and she didn't know who took her and she didn't know what she said after the event\nThat the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer\nThat the four people she said were there in the house all the night at the press and told nobody that the American people that only can sue what we call mainstream media had no idea of all of these holes in her testimony until Donald Trump\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing and immature the is the result of the\nLiberal socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another that video and video of these kids\nOn Saturday afternoon literally slowing the doors of the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop a real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted\nNot denounced all of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be in the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left\n\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to the decent people are we're we're not going to become them\n\nThey may have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us do not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of you that are here on the periphery\nBut do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation well how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have any interest to become who they are so given that\nHow are they stopped it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nTo stop things\nThey don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to you beat that back then you do it with the ... to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it\nSorry never Trump or is but the right manners and ... went and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia the ... the church is rock solid but churches where enduring vowed [laughter] uh not anymore\nThe churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is habit take a look at your papa and what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places\nSerious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\n\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them they're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\n\nI mean everybody's accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake\nMaking it up participating in the open and want to ruin nation of people do that he ever accuses them of that not\nNot I mean we may hear but its highest levels of government never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou [laughter]\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all\nTime to look at those two little girls and held them their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and actually Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear about every father loves having his children told that he was a great man few ever are\nAfforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming Kavanaugh's innocence I mean that is akin to taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it cabin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to ruin\nThe capital to openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that wasn't a corner law he knows what's at all but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to die on science I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or is she was also a sewage but somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why\nThe United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as ... as it got here it was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence no cooperation no nothing\nIn their strategizing of this event they never thought I Would go that far one of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise]\nIt won't work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees inside damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee president get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah blah but he pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused pullout withdraw ghetto capital that's where the gum up

I'll get right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is it's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that ah the president is teaching Republicans how to fight\nI actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like a loose and I don't think anybody's pick it up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it and\nThe question I had was what do you think would happen it because I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a ...\nI mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of\n... a media and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen got even close to being right rash of most of them was won by the way Rasmussen as tropics fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number of or drop us forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find a\nBuck the Republican governor of California is closer than running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have a leap possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house I think Washington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't\nSeen the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to win this\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learned people what Adams so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who\nAny under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a\nQueen size zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that had been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats can be up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating family [noise] [noise]\nWell uh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's really a lot of Republican tournaments what yeah committee chairman are retiring cause their term limited\n\nForty three members are retiring some are committee chairmen and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go\nBack to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention get t._v. time\nYou know you matter but when you're a term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and your parlay your time there and the big bucks in the private sector you know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them\nBut my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy it will ... there were people if this is all true there has\nTo be something or a series of things that the American public is just ... to be tied over and want to take it all out of Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people whose country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\n\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there in any even even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where\nGeorge W.
