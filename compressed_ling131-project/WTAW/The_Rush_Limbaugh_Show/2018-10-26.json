registered by people as they\nHear all of this I Am reporting it to you under guidance\nTelling you that I I just tell you what I'm finding in uh in various publications that are that are floating around there has been a a mad kept desire to id who ever was sending these bombs as a Trump supporter\nA all week long and they have not waited they are they're moving at light speed to make this association such as in this headlines suspected\nMake America great again bomber ID said as Native American Trump supporter stays are ... or say Iraq\nA fifty six [noise] so [noise]\nThere is and they still have this this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this screen shot of a website that list is party is the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a a bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make\nA whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down now in the midst of this\nThere continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers van\nAh down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the things that I had intended to share with you today is Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we every audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that\nChuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\nChuck Todd said that he fears the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well to CNN and Robert\nDe Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and that is so all of this confusion\nChuck\nTodd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the male bottom scare is dividing the\nCountry and that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily now I ... the reason that I [laughter] the Russians\nWhat is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press F Chuck Todd who believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence\nChuck Todd still operating under the belief that Russians stole the two thousand sixty to lecture somebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen\nAnd and and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nWere doing the coding with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press like the Russians could be behind it because it and just Chuck Todd to view this whole thing was bound and determined to help a\nThe the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do you think that the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nI mean you're talking about some very high profile people being out a lot of trouble\nHere reading that he'll eventually eventually the gears of justice Ryan slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why is it that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again\nIn order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once was elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nSorry I'm just saying let's discuss that you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there's no wrong answer who don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you'd you'd think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this\nThese midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in total are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment where they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the ...\nYou know I Will share something with that I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blonde hair has been keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and they have ever since election day two thousand sixteen they haven't been in various stages of panic\nAnd I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing the rent wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mild to panic about it writing about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty was an odd confluence of events\nThat that gave us a one off result that's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says\nBut if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth and it was it was a it was like I wouldn't say there was panic in it I'm reading the written word\nBut it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have lived with the belief that what happened in two thousand sixteen\nWas unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened\nIt was an odd confluence of events of band candidate with Hillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people had been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake and the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correctness missing now they're starting to begin to quite may be this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority\nAnd it kinda dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that a Trump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum devote because of his mom's now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went on a Trump\nRally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event it was sitting like twelve thousand I'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men there were ever going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and phone how how could you vote against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing an under sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nIt is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or does\nThere's been thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this I mean the idea that uh this week a bomb scare stories can dampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that\nDescribes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune to all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet\nThere are people let's continue you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a\nUsual lessening of enthusiasm or a gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is that was it's as important now is it wasn't two thousand sixteen\nIn fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I\nCan ... the rally in his ... he was talking about how he he pronounced he's got he's got a track record now\nIs it two years ago in the campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again we're going to stop this we're going to make a trade deals better but back\nThen it was just words that would just words but now two years later I've produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think from so supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to his spirit them a or to somehow we can ... and so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called sanctioned
