ratings folks great to have your we have for the first time\nWell it's tough to say first time we have an official there is no bones about it no mistake about it we have an official complete and total alignment among the drive by media now in the last\nTwo weeks before the midterm elections in the mainstream media is completely a line that they are completely in sync they are totally coordinated it doesn't matter where you go in the drive by media today\nYou're going to see everything under egg a subject heading or an umbrella Trump spreads wise and stokes fear I had an election\nThat graphic has been on CNN Ninety five percent of the of the time today\nSo much so I took a picture of it here to make sure that I Would remember it verbatim Trump's brands lies and stokes fears ahead of

being another Hitler\nThat Paul Krugman in the New York times and would cause an economic collapse from which the country would never recover still covering this is the Washington Post still claiming

in the theme of the day\nTrump spreads lies in stokes the years ahead of election when I got in here today\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is that for Democrats are drawn up an early lead\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for about\nOn election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get

happening but nobody in conventional Washington\nElitist establishment Washington would you ever think when it happened\nThese people come up with their story that stuck with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump and that hatred for Trump has grown and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energize and they get that in their hands and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens and they don't know what to do
