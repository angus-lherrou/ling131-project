later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister and I just want to be one of those who gets up there and said\nI'm done with this I Want to change it\nOr good for you are there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger who are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case I my whole

nothing really\nReally knew that I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much donors thinking about people who have kids are really really worried about their futures because of the way the west\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concepts of America it's scaring people what kind the country or their kids going to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American but what's going to be are they going to be free\nAre they going to have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you women\nWell and I don't think that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people\nThat don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do that stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where\nYou can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to hunt with or a country where veterans are put behind illegals I mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as the\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish on um the people you referred to as the illegals coming here who are not citizens but just being a granted access to so many things given so much why do you think it's happening\nA well there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come our way and you know um but I think it's just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's going to stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop in this\nTylenol I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wandering them here and and and what to do nothing to stop them from from getting in why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal\nWell aspect of this I don't well a lot of the people who are voting they don't\nKnow anything about why [noise] I don't know where to stop why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them five I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to these illegals coming and they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in ... agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals that live in California and there's a lot around where I live but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people don't want the river cheap labor cheap labor is the answer\nThe other side of it are you you're talking about people don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn well ... making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving bears but the answer\nThe answer to the question is because the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor you'll educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be said that they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters\nIt's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating\nLet me put it on his way rarely the

any education those are prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people the Democrats want to build a majority around because they won't be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not their undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them\nGive them health care make their track here make their trip pure worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for no some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves so I'm not going to get here and they're going to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite confident\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I guess it gets really hideous thing of Democrats want people need people who are incapable of self reliance\nAnd that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact though they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in them any way but they are great voters great dependent voters and\nThereby eyes so

they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country\nNow when they sat this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the Farrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make that\nBecause of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to then all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where's it\nIt's absurd where where's it hadn't\nYet my thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school so that's obviously a very common target they say\nWell except the ... the lessons you we we have gun free zones schools
