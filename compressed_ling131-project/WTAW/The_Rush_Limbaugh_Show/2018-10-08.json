voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of us sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the

the actions the words the policy is the attempts to inspire and persuade I just I don't see how any decent normal people fall for this\n\nI realize that Democrats are educated a lot of people in the
