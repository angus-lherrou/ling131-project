have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself the day the

with an executive order reversing the fourteenth amendment we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is that\nYou need somebody like Donald Trump that's the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended\nTo grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants now how many how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment which was used to grant citizenship to this slams and their descendants\nNow being used a grant citizenship to anybody and gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here\nAnd\nSo this is something that's long been fought to be untouchable Trump is saying I'd look I think I can fix this with an executive order\nAnd the reason he thinks so it is because the constitution is the final word fall to the constitution will actually

do by the way some of these forty five\nRetiring Republican as some of them were rhinos I mean they're they're not at all not total losses there were a lot of never Trump or is in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five and a lot of them quip because they were just fed up\nThat Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican Party and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go to go back just being regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture\nIn their place and this this orders\nWell in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nominations to replace these never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThey were Trump yes and so the the total number forty five resigning is not in and of itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them\nThe incumbent wins\nEvery year year and year out regardless there might be a year or two where there's a\nLarger wider variants than that but that's the overall stat buddy it could well be that the never Trump or is that retired knew they had no prayer anyway in their districts\nAnd so they quote unquote took the high road or the stomach Trump chunks of phone I don't I don't want to be part of the potentially split the scene and they're replaced by a ... and Trump supporters so that\nAnd it's time to overthrow that and change it and it's a serious movement and it's\nIt's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the night teen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise]\nAn offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where the changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and end the birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed ... unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a weeks ago before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's vow to enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens and I'm authorized immigrants born in America\nCame in an interview with ... was released yesterday Trump did not say when even signed the order and some of his past promises use executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intended to thrust the matter\nOf immigration into the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks\nAs I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this\nIs what pushing back looks like it was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore and you know what that means you know into this country together all these years is the\nHonoring intellectual results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and I'm almost ... really don't like each other but whoever won the election\nDecided who had a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago you didn't go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left what convinced\nThat they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away because people were set up with the Florida recount remember all that Al Gore got job but Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won and added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe are on values a basis that goes and\nExit poll showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican well fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama D. O. J. we're used to overthrow\nRun a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty\nEight featured even more violent unrest that we have yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find a period where it was worse than it is at present you could always go back inside the civil war but it is\nA seminal moment when a political party as its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump I don't feel good about it they disagree whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing because what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well let's just eliminate elections elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade\nPeople laughed and combine rice it's never going to have do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever so now Trump\nRather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept his election or rather the feelings hurt\nTrump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back\nWith additional\nEnergy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to and birthright citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected\nCitizenship is huge and it's why he was elected\nWhen things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control you have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing the left is the way it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump\nEven if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now but Trump hasn't it doubles down All right I'm just I'm going to shoot executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the or the fourteenth amendment ... begins\nAll persons not the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress in age and sixty six\nOr ... it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so agents sixty six it was passed by Congress and ratified but the state's Eighteen sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nAnd it was part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself it was a good thing\nUh our constitution was written so that mistakes epidemic could be corrected vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was on a tenable but they needed the union in order to fight the revolutionary\nWar they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they built in safeguards to wipe it out and it happened and agents sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this way all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S ended up the state where in\nThey reside it was clearly intended to be\nReferring to slaves and their descendants the parts that birthright citizenship a freaks have to delete\nArt naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that rub you are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be\nNaturalized well the birthright citizenship crowd which ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\n\nSo your born here or child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump has finally pushing back against an assumption that has been made because it was the least\nHalf of resistance if you will but now it's you have to make or break time\n\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture sometimes you've got to remodel house I got that quick\nTime out a little long haired next segments going to be back in the marsh Limbaugh going the way I'm lucky I met one\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask ... home what\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice but how much does it cost home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free what's the website again home\nAdvisor dot com or just download the free home advisor at [noise]\nStirs more debate on immigration me ...

everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump's signing the executive order everybody involved you know it was that's going to happen that then begins the process\nAnd it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment or it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left\nAnd they've got plenty

tend to\nJust promises they can't they connect Cape and they were selling something that isn't even viable because Medicare requires the private sector insurance without the private sector insurance

I don't know if I could believe what you're told me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happened\nWell it clearly wasn't this on Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from a Washington Post\nThe day after Steve ... was shot in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington Post headlines following the capture of the mail bomb mastermind and Trump support her ...\nAnd not surprisingly the post\nMade sure to emphasize that say odds political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up skull lease was not mentioned politically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding these two headlines up and pointing it out\nThe say oc headline read bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump\nWallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something light suspect arrested a closer inspection of the article finds that it does not even mentioned the ... was the bombing suspect until the fourth paragraph\nInstead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy\nTalking about his support for Trump and all of stickers on his van but on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings sadly congressman shot in Virginia it didn't mention his name ... didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention\nUm anything infected foot noted his support\nFor Sanders\nAnd it barely like one of the asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump\nSo here's Chris Wallace holding up the obvious evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\nAnd later on in the in the show adjacent Riley amber Wall Street journal was on\nHe said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter\nAnd if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why ...\nRight ... ... every day Donald Trump is the only Republican tweeting or informing people about the success of his policies everyday stock market good Trump tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets it\nEvery day what ever the economic news is or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is having he tweets and if it weren't for him in wouldn't be out there are other than us of course here\nOr in so called alternative media but but but the point is\nThe Republican Party is not even touting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it and that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it in and I hope we never does\nBut when I when I realized this that Trump is the only guy like\nToday there are a couple of tweets Trump tweeting the a consumer confidence\nAs being in a record high and and relating to how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been the the news of the day for two years there's all kinds of Republicans are running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats\nThirty five thirty six Senate seats where is I don't ... McDaniel is out there tweeting some things out now but where is the party in general touting itself and its achievements\nAnd you don't see it other than from Donald Trump\nAnd he's not whining about that he's unabashed he'd just tweets it out and uh and ... and he reached the truth out about the media\nAs they report on him and law and order distorts or what have you but there is an incredible incredible series of success stories\nThat at any time in the past would have been a great help\nIn use and assistance in running for election or reelection great news that would portray and show the Republican Party integrate light and Trump's it for the most part\nI'm it really when you stop to think about it if it's such\nA one man show in many regard as such such a missed opportunity\nThe consumer confidence news I mean\nHow can even be with all the news you see every day if you tuned in to any drive by outlook even reading the drudge headlines you wouldn't think we're on the verge of imploding\nAnd yet consumer confidence is at an all time high well that's a reflection of how people living literally living and their and their their thoughts on the future\nAnd his role bus we positive\nHow can that be if everybody's running around miserable in various stages of Faisal is a more defeat\n\nIts it's important it's very uh being positive is a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hard wired for human beings are hard wired for pessimism\n\nI've discussed this many times human beings have a natural tendency to defeat ism and failed ism 'cause it's easier uh it leaves the victim hood which of course that's attractive because it always means somebody else's to blame for what didn't happen to you or did the failures or whatever so\nIt's just a natural tendency to tend toward the negative everybody knows how and everybody does it but it takes\nDirect application you have to pause and take stock to actually think positively about things I Do it all the time I'm I'm ... I get myself in a in the other over something and I'll I'll stop and remind myself\nAnd I'll I'll stop and remind myself ... unbelievably fortunate I Am blessed\nBut the tendency is to be overwhelmed with the things that are disappointing or depressing or angering\nAnd\nFor that reason I it's easy to get caught up in all of the the negative is him and we are no doubt in the midst of a serious serious challenge for our country\nBut it shouldn't\nOverride or neck gate the real truth that we still live in America and we still have the greatest opportunity if we want to try to make the most of it and capitalize on it yeah they obstacles may be bigger and there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd\nI think the election needs to be looked at in a with a combination of these ways it's a positive opportunity to continue on the corrective path that we're on\n\nAnd it it it it's just better way to live but it takes application to do it when you're bombarded constantly with negative things that I must you know we all are guilty of doing that in a sense because we all want to sound appropriate warnings\nWhat's important to keep things in perspective at the same I've got to take a break I should develop this even more\nMeryl ... being at work\nWhen you put a safe and you're home what will you put in it what are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue\nIt takes skill sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world\nNow how do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive beaver network online at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our age I Am old rhino safe dot com", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "30"}
