someone else's expense\nNo no no ... and that's what you people are doing I'm merely chronicling what's happening out there it is a denial I just shared with you one of the countless examples like inside this guy Michael list uh\nIn the New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaugh's crying because he's a white man targeted singled out for advancement in America by other white men and when it's not going his way breaks down and cries\nThis piece justifies the attack on white men it says it it's about time the whole country and the assault on the whole country is validated because it's actually

Jennifer Rubin it's amazing transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger during the Obama\nYears during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger been when Trump gets elected she became I think what's he's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has of this\nThe died the cast in the wool liberal and now she has a the still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes to the deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if\nIt's their time of the month does anybody think that would fly\nThere is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us or admit here's Jennifer Ruben\nAnd by using this this this analogy these Republican senators behaving is if it's their time of the month is that not acknowledging that there is such a thing as\nTheir time of the month so who is it here that's being cliched and discriminatory\nAnd furthermore pointing out one of the big differences between men and women because men except those who are trying\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nIn other words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters the purse and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populists coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood\nAnd her point is that the targets of range had somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and Rio waking these people and fired the backup so she says this is what I see in a nutshell\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh\nHas served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from cabinet by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high now that's\nAgain that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today heading into the two thousand sixty in two thousand each in midterms now where I\n\nWill she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people voted for Trump are deeply involved with things now maybe there are some exceptions\nAnd you have some people who voted for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats in sound Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that\nTrump voters didn't so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nPounded every day\nMultiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild the military bring back the economy\nI Would think people that voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nBut is her insistent know that kind of stuff it evaporates in wanes you know people's lives go on the news changes but the this camp on a circus has re ignited the coalition that elected Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nSays the Senate couldn't did see a red wave\nShe says the Senate\nCould and did see a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nI found it interesting analysis and I wanted to share it with you she points out the Democrats are spending money in house races out there like we've never seen before and the Republicans aren't and that leads me to another point that I Need to make but I don't have time right now hang on we'll be\nBack to ... to talk radio oh yard work\nSay folks if your own land you're going to want to listen to this my good friends with my hindrance may have the best Mahindra tractor deal I've ever seen for a limited time get them a hindrance ... twenty S.

thank you very much I appreciate that more than you know\nI'll be quick I'm a military service member of sixteen years and after witnessing that's a cabinet officer I guess my friends and family say hey you should run for political office after that there's no way\nBecause being deployed several times to stand up and left would be to accuse me of war crime now Raasch\nIs not there so it's not I'm not going to present a problem with a solution and here's the illusion after Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh it that'll then you should pile land are charged with again sweat like Ramirez or any other activists liberal slander for the new standard will be\nGuilty until proven innocent and I can tell you this right now my military brothers and sisters have not hot and dry for that sort of write for this country\nDamn right\nThat is exactly right I don't think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them I don't think that uh once you start getting into the government government officials and so forth the\nPentagon or you've got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything they can lie about whoever and whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it\nThe the uh the remedy for that is more speech which in this case equals more money to\nCounter the lives that are being told it's off the frustrating thing that drives\nA lot of average people out of politics even to the point of not voting or not caring 'cause they think why should I I don't know who's telling me the truth probably nobody is I Can't keep track of it any way is not worth me the banks and it causes it causes a lot of people will tune out but this is causing people to\nTune in I Wish there were a a remedy for this because it is all of what you said slanderous in libel is a\nBut there isn't there isn't any recourse you know the it's the old saw successes the sweetest revenge\nI'm telling you this folks I think you ought to be prepared I let's let's do a little hypothetical what's presume that it's tomorrow at five thirty the votes over and Kavanaugh's confirmed me asks you a question\nDo you think that the Democrats in the Senate the Democrats in the media meaning the media do you think all of these deranged psychologically out of whack protesters are just gonna say well we gave our best shot we'll wait till they nominate somebody else and try to destroy them\nOr do you think that they will continue in their effort to wipe Kavanaugh out and destroy him\nBelieve me shoes door number too especially if these clowns when the house they are going to immediately amount to things impeachment to Trump and therefore impatient Kevin all\nBecause if Trump shouldn't have been there and at first wife than his nominees shouldn't be either this is not\nGoing away there's only one way that it might there's only one way that it might\nAnd it's a huge long shot and it does this end by All right my all that is just by all with a world in which God ... is president the Democrats\nTo have their rear ends handed to them and these upcoming elections by all the ... just by all that's decent they ought to be wiped out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown is on how many separating fact the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh heading for a final vote in the U.S Senate tomorrow after clearing a key
