much access\n... actually you know what they don't have that well\nThey do have access Trump stops in talks to them wherever he sees a pack up and gathered now he may not accept every interviewer request which they would define as as access but they cannot say that Trump is hiding from them like Obama did\nAn Obama wasn't hiding he just thought the media wasn't much pack rats that he didn't he didn't want it to send to their level I mean he knew they were on his side\nBut he knew that they were fools he knew that he owns them he knew that he had the media wrapped around his little finger and they thought Obama loved they thought that Obama thought they were cool they fought that Obama thought they were his equals Obama never things anybody is as equal especially the media\nMany many ways is and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact because I'm having they would say that in the old days and if you got the support of a

no\nI think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a pie he won't accept blame of GOP loses house\nNow the eight people tell you well that's essentially what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting Donald Trump does not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing\nThe need for excuses any pay he thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's gonna blame him\nThis is why Trump\nNever misses an opportunity to talk to the media it's why he

find it anywhere in\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their

Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is\nAnti illegal immigration or wants to

up in the numbers that everybody expects them to she's suggesting that that may be the case here the Democrats available light a fire\nUnder the Latino thing bothered them and what the Latino think what that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are stunned that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue\nFor Trump and the Republicans and it is it is the issue every Republican running for office either incumbents or running for the first time needs to be focusing on this issue there is no way it's going to hurt them\nOn

over a blue wave NBC News fines Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there during all do a whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much ... but there are so much motivation there's so much inspiration to nothing can hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that something\nThat's not a blue wave may be shaping up here that's what this headline is that in certain they over a blue wave NBC News minds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level\nAs past cycles comparing registration activity from twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixty inch current\nHelps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include a complete picture of registration from those years whereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what\nThat's all you need to get them but you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have a full database numbers for two thousand they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration with Democrats are supposed to be smoking us in voter registration 'cause there's so\nMuch more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying to help\nThe Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans\nHeadline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat Megan McCarthy all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats is saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats\nJust stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masked back on your Democrats have got to read camouflage yourselves she's warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda\nOf course we should fight massage and racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks didn't want to read just sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the good yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that\nThan there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're leaking that Mueller has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think the report says every member they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years it's daddy reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\n\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump Russia collusion happen so\nMueller's report is Randy you to be released soon create the impression that it's only a matter of time no before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nThe voting in turn out prior to the midterms I'm just going to tell you if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the election they're not going to want this out before the midterms\nYou imagine a let down that what you don't know you don't know how many\nOf your base common ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia\nYou'd be done at the number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it like gospel\nDespite all realm of common sense\nDespite every\nBit of knowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball the Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe it's mandates they\nBelieve that if they are told before the midterms that the smaller report doesn't\nHave this evidence and will not leave the President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\n\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump\nAs an incompetent as a boob who are in get injured the United states electoral system with his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as any incompetent\nWho nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence and stupidity\nBut I don't think there's going to be any evidence of it\nAnd the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out before the midterms I could be wrong only have to wait and see it won't be long either way\nWhat needs

you're demonstrating your your arrogant white privilege here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am a [laughter] a a ... to the ah the article from I Believe it was ... that ah ah that they're going to release the ball or a report\nOr sometimes after the election and ready to that yeah understand that we don't believe that\nWe're not going to believe anything Mohler anyway\nNow that's an interesting point too\nI mean a lot of the ... or ... implicate or the or an Obama administration\nAnd Hillary Clinton and the DNC or in a a good for the gay shouldn't including with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says\nThe [noise] uh I I just don't understand that the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not going to deal with people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump\nThey don't understand is like a you know the magnificent seven\nUh those guys didn't you know when the guys came up there they didn't they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians like we're Aurora [noise] uh you know if they\nAre not with a a good life they wanted somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country over the last uh a few ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is\nUm I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to do and if they could be it would be icing on the cake I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters Democrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to\nAssemble this gigantic Democrat Party and then there's like combination coalition of minority here minority just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is on Jennings up a first time participation um and that's why this this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the\nAnger is so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout based on what they think is the majority of Americans didn't hate ...\nI I think they they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing the news as I Do more and more stories that are starving\nTo raise red flags about the blue wave and\nThere are some that rush don't fall for doing this on purpose or sucking you when they're making you think they're given up they're making you think they're trying to despair or you know trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not going to ever pull\nThat off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide threw out the entire\nLeft wing media universe a disciplined approach to run fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if I ended up being\nWrong so be it I'm not afraid of being\nWrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it is I have never slumped because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHaven't been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco in Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on an even they're stupid travel\nUh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do it like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think it all of these things were true a lot of people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about all\nThis but they're not write about it but I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there's a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Ross didn't fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nAnd then you couple that with their their mentality that says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world stop at stake if all of this\nI haven't been going their way how in the world stock pathetic if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary would have won in the first Trump would have never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag in two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there were there wasn't any talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long necks segments going to be short\nAll of us read about it in the
