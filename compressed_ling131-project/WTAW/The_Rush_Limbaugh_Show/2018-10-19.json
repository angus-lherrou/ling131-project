disagree with your assessment of what this election is about the main voting issue is not immigration or health care is is that the Democrat voting base is a bunch of nuts\n[noise] I Wish that were true I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity\nThe psychological disorders and I mean that with every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters\nBeing psychologically screwed up they are suffering psychological disorders because of the things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country part they want to blame the patriarch and they want to blame the founding\nBut then they they they claimed that the only fix for it is the government punishing the people that did whatever happened to these ... and the Democratic\nParty has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd try to normalize them all\nBy enshrine ing them as policy planks in the Democratic party platform if you will\nAnd that's how we end up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving a whole way of the Democratic party thrown behind them to

actually implement their forms of punishment\nAgainst groups of people they blame for whatever as wrong in their lives these are not people that think they can fix things themselves they're not people

no hope\nThat the deck is stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity\nTheir religion whatever Democrat Party is help in making all these people believe they are justified in thinking\nThat life is miserable because of all these horrible other people do what they've done to them and then the Democratic party let us fix it for you we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and the\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examined every Democrat constituency group that they've been representing the last take your pick ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy\nHave had their issues addressed and fix or are they as miserable as they've always been are they is angry as they've always been if not more so are they still complaining today about things they were complaining about injustice discrimination or

every that's not what she means she means minority rights being able to trample on the majority that's what that means\nRespecting the dignity and wars and very meaning every person in our party with a psychological disorder you\nMust accept as normal that's what that means [noise] while you're laughing in there because you know I'm right you just don't believe I've got the guts to be saying this\nThat's exactly what this means respecting the dignity ... worth of every person in our country means you've got to accept as normal every odd ball in our party is suffering a psychological disorder you must accept it and you must love with them and you must make way for them\n\nAnd if there's some collateral damage she rambled him for some who do not share our view well so be it\nBut it shouldn't be our original purpose what\nWell even the the this was Breitbart store even they say it's not clear what ... mostly men by collateral damage\nWhat couldn't she means what else could she

I voted for Trump I'm an avid Trump voter and them America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question your\n... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty\nAnd all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted it back on harmed and we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and they said yes we do\nAnd we're going to continue the spy 'cause we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here\nIs really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that it was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up\nAnd I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it have to do with it what what I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet\nThese hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this\nI said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam and that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was anti McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical uh inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he\nFound out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he he told me was so when you didn't\nRealize that the Saudi royal family\nIs\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and Medina Medina\nI've found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islam comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday I beg your indulgence\n... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are\nWelcoming anybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is\nAnd that's what I mean went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\n\nThat's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve Mont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam all\nWhole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars in oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley and the typical places and other countries as well and part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment or the uh distancing from war ...\n\nAccording to Ben selmont Saudi Arabia cannot modernized and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to ... again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want while habits of watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith a deposition muggy this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines what these kings have countless ... they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSaw Saudi king could have twenty sons\nHow does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be is air it's not just first in line they have a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the winning the edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen solve mom Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as ground friends\nKnow many people think that this is up to the king the king determines what your his son just got to be the next king but it's not the case\nSo all of these plans are modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\n\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of Dr Marcus show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi Arabia\nBecause the climate roast turkey Recep Tayyip air to why he is
