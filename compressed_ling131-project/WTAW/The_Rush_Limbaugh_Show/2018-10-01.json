C. A.\nTrump has been speaking about this for the last half hour outside the oval office\nAnd he's in a fine fine mood as is everybody gathered there it is a major major achievement again it is something that the Democrat opposition which includes of course the media all said could not happen\nIt couldn't be done it was a waste of time to try as they said scratching their heads why just Trump care about trade deals anyway and they've never understood the Trump voter caring about trade deals they've never understood the connection Trump made an maintains\nWith voters on trade and it's not just NAFTA it's any number of other things\nAh Jared Kushner has come in for a lot of credit on this deal which means he is going to be in the crosshairs right along with Brett Kavanaugh about whom we will get to in due course\nBut the NAFTA knows is going to be buried which is one of the reasons why Trump spending so much time talking about giving the drive by a media a a tough\nTime in knowing it but for Trump its electoral politics in addition to making America great again\nIt is um I wouldn't say crochet but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject the world trade don't doubt me and in that sense it's a confidence inspiring\nThat Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear it to be who he is will me in a bunch of great things happening for the country and this can be part of land and to any number of\nCampaign ads\nFor the upcoming midterms because it's going to be about a lot of things not just the cabinet nomination and other things that this is going to be a fundamental aspect in

during the doctor for testimony the prosecutor asked her how\nTo think for her legal fees and her daughter on as you mentioned her ... and those three patriot prayer hosted a million dollars and I are happy from kind of ethical issue what you could just accuse somebody\nWithout any kind of corporate evidence and then go public with that and raise you know that that amount of money or is it it's a very very troubling thought\nIt was a lot of weird and fences there for people to make accusations that they think they could raise a lot of money or your your crowd or\nLook this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are a range lunatics who want her to be right\nTo hope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell if they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw cabin all\nThey were happy to pay for it this is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than happy to pay it doesn't matter to them that she can afford her lawyers herself\nIt doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case so she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts in the Gulf on me page I actually think somebody sent\nMe a note today that uh go fund me go find me as a new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were\nA because there's a lot of this money going to go a lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be what they are already involved\nAnd Democrat Party politics so it's just it's it's a new form of fund raising this not call fundraising miss is made to look like people supporting a bit drag older

whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw a conclusion that the Gulf ... pages of\nWay to get Democrats soccer's\nI eat voters\nTo pay for this so that it doesn't cost people who already have a lot of money anything than you could try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you jump in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left is always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you have no ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences and yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop\nWhen your tactics work there's no reason to stop it said no fully as ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that maybe it maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them but maybe let's say for a year that's become them let's let's show them that anything\nDestructive they can do to other human beings it can all\nThe way that you know one thing I reject this whole are I'm not I don't disagree with you I reject this argument we don't want to become the we have to become a Hitler to be Hitler\nAnd we have to become the emperor to beat the gym no we can be used in the can be these people it's just a decent people are not conditioned and primed for it every day\nWas followed by agreement\nWith Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI you allowed to do one way of investigating\nTheir fire mellow fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs\nIf you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it and we shared it with your way to go and it dies\nExcept for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care when they got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys Lincoln but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did\nOh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein ever going to investigate some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be followed through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are further away\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's denial\nHow why is that is so hard she didn't have any evidence\nShe made a credible witness how\nWell she was really suffering and in pain so\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility\nAn attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility\nDemocrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out cabin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied up being let down again\nThen the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want to management happening there own can there are going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day\nWhere Kavanaugh is not\nConfirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be there\nAre you going to be so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed in the Senate\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin off we're in the majority and we couldn't get confirmed but you don't need to come out and vote for us how does that work\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority\nKavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this\nThe unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there were guaranteed to get their votes weren't going to there's going to be a Republican way of cars or whatever to Kevin and then a Republican start campaigning\nAnd they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in\nYour that majority we know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut is that going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\nThey keep working and voting\nMostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump's\nTrump alone will be able to make the case\nTrump alone will be able to\nTurn a cabinet defeat into turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it\nVote for us Kavanaugh was defeated\nVote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee\nIs that really\nEffective I just don't I don't\nHear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to lose something\nSo that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here and sort of rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here we have it also Campbell doesn't make it difficult to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me\nIt ought to be the other way around\nThis is another trick I think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up you have an odd doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how in the hell\nYeah is is that advocacy for\nReelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad yeah at what\nThe guy got railroad railroaded in our guys couldn't stop it and and we're supposed to say well okay man we're really loaded now that's going to cause the turn up the ... sorry folks that I don't think it works that way\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is\nThat voters are going to be out there saying even what we vote Republican Democrat still run down\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other way\nThat the wind is\nWe have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nBy the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of ah people who think their expert political analyst and they all\nWell not all but I mean a whole bunch of them\nThat the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy\nA
