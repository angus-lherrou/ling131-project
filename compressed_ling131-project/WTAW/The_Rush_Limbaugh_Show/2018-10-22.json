the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh\nActually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think sixteen after bunch always gangs came across\nThe border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only ... Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the more you got to stop bogus asylum claims\nAnd basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from and also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to lower he'll talk about Japanese talking to Jeff and I don't even know who is toys who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions suggested big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are\nAll great points they already qualified\nFor asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here\nBut of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this\nAre the left I think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprise as its eventual waiting but I think this is the left\nIt defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't\nThink they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave\nWhat we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing Trump of the Republicans I couldn't wait to put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is that Democrats have been losing elections left and right\nBut for some reason\nThe two thousands extremist germs the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen and we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it\nBegan to look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and\nOh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's on poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one there is nothing happening that suggests\nSay blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI eat election day people have to start reeling in these Madden cat predictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who'd hire them\nSo now we're told\nWell there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house when a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see the blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get to pull result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decided to put in your sample\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party\nOpenly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when\nThe American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration the American people in a majority no matter how you slice and are not asking\nFor a political party to stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never have been there\nThe Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGo do your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border to let anybody who wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet they can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans in a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there there's the hungry we we we have so much they have so little we mark what the that's not a\nPosition it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority of the American people Donald Trump ... never gotten the Republican nomination if the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked\nTo be granted asylum truck with an never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president\nSo you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up you know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they won and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing they're poor are coming from ... countries left them that's not\nA majority opinion of the United states\nThe beat it is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case that's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in\nTrouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point\nMedia reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd that's just not where the American people are one other thing about this [noise]\nNow don't get to the final Louie Gohmert my dad's a second look at is this is a CNBC story from just this morning the headline growing caravan
