around sixty four\nSixty five miles an hour in the Panama City Panama City beach area these one hundred and fifty miles an hour winds are in the Iowa poll they are not the entire storm\nA I have not tried to to to minimize the impact here it's just that the reporting on these storms\nAnd the education on these storms in general is I think wanting it's lacking such as the way they've colorized the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth when any any hurricane the strongest wins are in the eye wall and a little\nYou know extended from it but there's not\nToo many places are going to get a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds today wherever the eye wall hits and maybe twenty miles depending on the size of the I Will not from there it'll fall off nothing nothing a\nHundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five amount on our wins well that's not bad like and it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus audit Seventy five months

cat for its gonna doubled is it won't ... on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five ... just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr five hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it the further you get from the eye of depending on the structure the the more the wind speed\nDecreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst when the storm\nAre only in the eye wall area\nAnd people can look at these storms and the graphics while a hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I might say oh we're in it now it isn't not trying to downplay the or the damage

want to get a direct hit everybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct yet\nThe damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit\nIt's always the direct yeah that that is the most destructive and then it it starts to decline as you get away from me I depending upon the strength of the storm is going to have a wide destructive swat as

keep hearing that the suburban women have completely left the Republican Party and that was an exact opposite of what I witnessed left side of the political\nWell I can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage in is that all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nThat was I I don't know if you got any feedback from any other Trump rallies that you get feedback from but\nWhat about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there could you detect that men were husbands or are they ah\nThe guy that I was sitting next to his daughter he took took her to school or they could bring our daughter I was just amazed that the ...

I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to a salt and a timid data intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote but white Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\n[noise] yes um you know nobody's got signed in science and they are it's like everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad guy that was ... and now they talk about it and it's almost like you know we live for about it like ... or ... or you don't have a ... oh\nYes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state if the regime was listening to him\nAnd so you're basically this driving describing the same thing the difference is that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot\nLeaders so you you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in yards but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not call attention themselves\nRight\nWhere you're concerned about violence is Sharon let it grabs soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox and friends today and uh it was only usually Earhart uh so you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody's going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died from a very very angry violent man\nWho was inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nBut he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people\nWith anger issues there are people that are prone to violence\nThere is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to say what the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party\nWants America to think\nThat\nThis in unhinged behavior is pretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger\nAnd the un his behavior justified on the basis of the trumpet so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nThere's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people\nTo back off a little it'd be more responsible they don't think it would help them they think this kind of on the hinged I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know better when I many times\nCan you call them insane or not right or mentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value\nIn these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building and confronting people in elevators and basically frightening the\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes\nTo get done what they need to get done so don't don't think that they're going to get a dose sensibility\nOr responsibility and asked for it to be dialed back and part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of unleashing misbehavior on themselves\nWhen as I used to be said Russia ... worth\nPrices for
