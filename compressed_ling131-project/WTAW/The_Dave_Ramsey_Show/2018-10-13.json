perimeter of the inside of the calls space and and a seal off the systems with him in a fire and some up and how they work and it's such a solution to these kinds of problems\nSo first of all the roof drains were going where before you have to step\nDown in French train\nYeah that's not too smart huh\nWas diverted that and and it helped a lot but it still moist under their\nAll right so now that you've got the roof trains disconnected from the from the French train 'em or those drains extending out away from the foundation perimeter\nWell generally those streets are made up of algae or moss and they have more frequently on the north side of the roof because it's a cooler side of the roof and there's more shade there\nAnd a product that you could use to address that is cold wet and forget it's concentrate you mix it up you spray on the roof\nAnd then slowly but surely it kills the algae chose the mosques and kills the mold it's there and cleans the roof and so within a very short period of time you'll find that the roof which brings shiny again\nOkay that that product come at a I'm a ... hook it up to those are you actually do have to get up on the roof\nDon't believe it does

thanks you guys were clean that these were soils slopes away from the house we've got an extensive articles exit several of them on a Monday ... dot com to search how to stop a leaking basement as the same advice\nAnd we talk about the proper drainage improvements so do that first and then in terms of the country itself\nYou can use a patch in compound quick Crete has a patch in compound product you definitely want to use the packaging compound because it's designed to stick to the old concrete if you try to put new concrete over it it's not going to stick\nSo they're ready to use patching compounds are trial applied there latex formula so it's easy to clean up but that will seal the old concrete than one says dries then you've been painted\nAnd what I Would look for is in the ... floor pain of the box he paints I liked because there there are chemical cure when you buy the floor paint you get the paint and a gallon can that's about three quarters spilled and then of course a partner you mix them together stir them up\nAnd then you apply to paint sometimes there is um an attitude that goes in after the fact that gives you some texture to the floor helps kind of hide the dirt but patching at first and having an epoxy paint will have that looking like noon no time\nOkay but I have a car wreck\nQuick creature you I K. R. E. T. H. quick create concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling us at age ... money pit\nI got written in Illinois and the line and getting some water through the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is a ... or time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement in on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall\nBut it was about eight foot tall where it meets the house\nIt hasn't really separated from the house but there is water they get in between reaching all end up on the show and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so I'm trying to figure out the previous owner that had this houses\nPut something in there like a call ... or some type of gotten a hard time and it's\nNot falling down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you by the way you can see all this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating\nSo on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall yes\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much water that collects in that area where we are going to try to do is limit the amount of water that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations\nSo the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this war could work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with a with leads into the basement secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called the curtain drained Richard\nIt's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou take a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide\nYou put some stone in a trench then you put a purported type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone ... he's a filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible\nIn the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylight somewheres you figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nThe fall of the trench come up with a pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well and needless to say probably to do some uh get rid of landscaping and this gets a little green Bush's along along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water so just think in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out and I think you'll be in good shape\nI think so much for calling them money pack now when the breakdown in your home you know that life can come to a screeching halt ... something like your wife Sharon we're going to happen in a way that you can figure out what's wrong and that you're\nShe\nWould you wonder why
