a couple of different techniques that you can use\n'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short stiff\nBristle that's you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you should have dragged that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and then let that dry and then\nPut it in a coat on top and then dragged outlined through\nUm you could do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called the Venetian plaster but that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing it and rubbing and it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of cloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it\nUm there's this waited texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the paint that makes that

probably joined by three inches long\nAnd I can't ever no way and so I was on the carpet up new carpet match your carpet and then but I don't know how to put a threshold down there and they're\nWell first of all I'm putting carpet in the bathroom is certainly a bad idea because obviously doesn't mix with the moisture even if it's an indoor outdoor style carpet I don't know what you have but I I Would recommend against carpet in the bathroom so the dogs ... may have done you a favor because it's forced to take the carpet up your question is\nHow do you put his threshold like in the door so that you would have to clean edge\nYeah well I mean you certainly certainly which basically do is you put it in the door so there and it sits even with the door when it's closed so it's about as sick as the door plus another interest so it's it's usually a couple of inches thick and it may be higher on one side where the carpet is lower than the other side with the floor is\nBut it's a pretty
