shingles fish do the money that home improvement show I'm Tom Sawyer in Jamestown Rhode Island today\nAn cheer hanging with our friends from this old house they've invited me to be a part of the final day of production\nHere and dreams dumb as a complete and a really unusual house they've taken one hundred year old she started house that when it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand new addition and they've made this entire structure show energy efficient\nIt's known as a net zero house which means just designed to create the total amount of energy it needs to operate coming up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the two year which team\nIncluding Kevin O'Connor Roger cooked pause norm ... will be by to talk about a very special mouse to reach by very few programs because this is the forties season of this old house so let's get due to kick things off I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Tim and OConnor welcome Kevin\nAnd I mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you or how would you been a friend too many homeowners now for\nMany many years and your role as host and congratulations on the forty is that this whole pow wow\nWas host and congratulations on the forty a season at this old house wow\nYeah we're a season forty season forty years if something were very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are at twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still going that it's still popular that we're still doing beautiful buildings like this and we're taking it for a little bit of a victory lap are proud of it\nAbsolutely so tell us about this area Jamestown now we're kind of right across the river from Newport which is famous for mansions and cliff walks is this where you move if your name wasn't Vanderbilt\n[laughter] I'm not sure it's an island or I Am right in there again it sounds so to the west of us at the mainland of Rhode Island and into the east of us as you say is the peninsula of Newport we're all the mansions are all the sailing\nOr it's a smaller island community back in the day people had to take the ferry to go to school from here to the mainland we're now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the hubbub of Newport\nFor us it's the home of our architect is also a homeowner right who's fall in love with the area they had been vacationing here for many years and he decided no this is where you want to raise our kids and we went to live and so that is what is sort of started this project to begin with\nNow this is a net zero project and that probably had a lot of challenges behind that you took a very old building ... edition and significantly increase the space of it I had to bring us together and are not as a trick when it came to the energy efficient\nGet net zero has two components to you've got to make your own energy and we do that with solar panels and that's kind of new beautiful technology but you also have to try to reduce the load that you use in the house right and as you know these old houses the original when he was built in the Nineteen twenties um ... like a sieve\nThey come and go most of the time in a trash comes in and out we place to grill near the back door a there is the barn or that they're in and out of and they do projects it's a it's a family of of of ah\nConstructors right this ... stuff yeah I definitely bills yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in the ... were just very comfortable moving from one zones and the next ... exactly that's what a design comes in in his eye from the design\nNow you've got to actually play in the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes oh yes so\nWe gave them both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a design defense or does come back we're all of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows yup uh and then there's also the circulation space in the back into the back back yard a which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do what young boys do\nNo if folks are listening to this thinking you know what ... should I go through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get them started will\nEither which you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space outside but if you can't get to it it doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter] and and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England\nWe live inside quite a lot of the time but a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the views of open space\nAnd then to zone those different areas as they relate to the house and then as they relate to the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside in the room splitting sensitive to exactly the rooms and and the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right\nIf you got five acre lot you have a house in near it's usually in lawn and you know everything kinda bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edge has become more to find and they become more inner grew into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to keep in mind if you're\nYou know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now\nIs where I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now and start staring at those windows you thinking about those bases that and you know really living through it in your head you know maybe making the paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can't imagine the space shuttle sets sack\nBut now's the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on well done project\nHere Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money pet great thank you and you'll find this old house and asked those little house on your local PBS stations plus for more details and behind the scenes photos\nVisit this little house dot com or follow at this little house on Twitter and Facebook and ...\nWage Jamestown\nWell as you heard there are many\nAnd ... wage Jamestown\nWell as you heard there are many many things about this home that are special and that includes the lawn there's actually a very unique type of turf called micro clover here\nWith us to talk about that is this old house landscaping contractor Roger Cook and pat Hogan was sod co welcome guys welcome you so this is a house where the environment is really at the forefront and you've chosen a type of Turks here\nThat is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for ... let's talk about you call it micro clover what is\nThe micro clover is just what it is it's a clover but it's not like the Dutch clover right minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a call to ask you mix and is very trout tolerant\nThe clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen grass can use so you don't need to fertilize it\nRoger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the lawn chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get 'em just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn so a lot of water and a lot of the ... and then you've got to spray the weeds and bugs and everything else so this is the type\nOf perfect you see a lot commercially is it unusual to put it in a residents\nWell we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future is going to keep going ...\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that it's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so that quite a bit of traffic across that lawn and no I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State ... research on this\nStuff look gorgeous he was a very happy to see\nSo when you put down a side Roger as opposed to you know growing one from scratch wants to prep involved\nOr that I think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we rode or to scare a fight and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in to get down into a tank of themselves and get whatever moisture Zia than we find greed will ... will put in some lime if it needs it and then the seat is on [noise]\nNow we're in the midst of a wrench all rainstorm right now [laughter] I had to eat off as LSU irrigation today but does it take\nThe same amount of water or less or more than you wear traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it is does not use a lot on the water and ... yeah we have to get in fact we have to educate people who are not watering so much\nThat's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough [noise]\nSo how can you add this to an existing Warner you always have to start from scratch from San ... I think\nWith the micro ... you can over seated into it but I Would say you wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant or more than a century right correct and they're just not because they're not going to get along [laughter]\nThose two types right yeah we've put it in with the tall fast you that's more drought tolerant though this is a harsh\nEnvironment because it's right here on the coast I guess the appropriate\nProduct for a seaside community uh yes it is a lot of salt and all that actually more of salt resist in bluegrass is well that's what I Love about this old house I mean you know you learn things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that there's\nThis very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool I'm In a while you guys\nYou know always sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it just you know it just keeps fashioning the audience that's probably why they're around for for forty years now is the end of the forty a season so congratulations on all the good work you put into that Roger bank some around here\nYeah

outlived its usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for one hundred your home it's a tie called not into\nIt with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it is electric ... been Giles welcome Ben Adler you we're good thanks for stopping by the money to this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that ... it was probably the first sort of ... of these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel pipe installation are saying that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been too We're actually talking about real knobs\nIt's interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been too We're actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beams so you drill hole and they look like a ceramic tube through it to sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strong on these ceramic knobs and\nIt was essentially an air cooled just so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to eat these homes Annette insulation and what happens well\nIt eats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot in these older homes as you know in the homes were originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all these modern appliances that we have today\nAnd all those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring on to the old system in unsafe way right\nAnd using it incorrectly a and again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with poor installation techniques of newer wiring and the and the increased loads of the homes that just create some dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not a bad one who's fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that were still active\nOh yeah there was definitely most of the house had some now than to than it there were a lot of things tapped off of that knob and to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system\nI'm so it was definitely a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to zero and start over\nTheir real education and I understand that you spent quite a bit of time working with The Apprentice is for the season Mary Smith and Kevin Barker how'd they do\nAll those guys are great I've actually known Kevin for quite a while he worked for another contract or that I subcontract too so Kevin I'm pretty familiar with he's a great guy good carpenter definitely learning a lot and and tired of progressing towards that skilled trades men type of\nPosition and Mary was just awesome you know really I only got to work with her a few times but she definitely had a great attitude willing to work hard wanted to learn loves what she does so those types of people are always fun to be around\nSo they were brought on this show basically as an example of what we eat in this country which is young people that are learning skilled trades do you think they were good ... years for that mission oh for\nSure yeah you know they both love what they do they both loved to learn about what they do so that's a great start you know you can teach a lot of things but you can't teach work ethic are passions so those guys are both great for that\nTalking to bend drowsy the electrician on this project in Jamestown Rhode Island and then before I let you go I understand you had some uh help with this project kind of a star assistant joining you with the rough wiring you had Congressman John Norcross from my home state of New Jersey stopping by that was pretty interesting he used to being electrician right\nYeah he was a commercial and industrial guy and he worked with the union and the larger installations but\nDefinitely a great guy very very nice to talk to a very knowledgeable and very interested in this whole Generation Next than apprenticeship\nProliferation stuff so he's a great guy in that field and he didn't make a federal case I Know he was very easy going um you know you could just tell that that's really his passion is to get young people to trade jobs that will really carry
