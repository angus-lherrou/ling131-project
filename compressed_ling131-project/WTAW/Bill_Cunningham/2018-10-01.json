I think it will be a great Supreme Court justice\nYeah I mean I listen I I assume I Hope uh and I think you'll be a Supreme Court justice but I don't know because the whole point of this was Jeff Flake in my opinion this\nWas set up shop for like ... is the United states senator your kitchen women aren't allowed to get an elevator with United States Senate and the Capitol building how did they get in this whole thing was a setup Jeff Flake they asked them to come in that was his cover for demanding an FBI investigation [noise] you know how those two women getting the elevator that convinced him to\nChange his mind from a yes vote to I Want an FBI investigation and the answer is that it was set up from day one and he wanted those two women in the elevator and he wanted to use them as cover\nSo there has to be a reason they want this one week delay and of course it is either because they're going to have ten more women come forward right and wrong claim that brick capital raped them or attempted rape them or whatever he did to them\nWho knows what they're going to say sexually harassed them\nAnd they're going to try drags on forever number one and number two they're never going to be satisfied with a limited FBI investigation or all the FBI does ever edge as brick capital honestly said if they file a form after interviewing people and they don't come to any conclusion and they tell you what everybody said so he said no rape she said rape\nAnd nobody will ever know the answer to that so\nThen they're all going to charge enough and there's got to be more FBI delegation including\nFor the girl who says he gang raped them ah you know the the one is with attorney Michael Evan ... just an absolute fraud so look it's never going to end the Jeff Flake wanted it to never end he's a creepy the bad guy the villain in this whole thing number one villain is Dianne Feinstein and number two villain is the whole Democratic Party and number three ... Jeff Flake\nAnd I thought his answers were kind of swarm strange\nAnd invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him\nBut in the end I came down on the idea that this was forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories which could be prove none of which had evidence\nAnd none of which had witnesses you cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided that it works with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this\nIs if it was real Feinstein would've brought it up and one on one meetings with the man show can you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me and you sit across to me and you say\nNothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look here's my column basically said I Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him they could do it to anyone I grew up and it all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nI was number one in my class like Brett Kavanaugh I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school Yale we both got out of the chief great success\nIn life and now they're trying to destroy him and I can tell you one thing guys like that do raped women there's no way doesn't happen\nFinding a case in America where a guy was number one in his class and it was ideally educated and with the sport started a great kid and has tons of women friends and tons of childhood friends who stand up for him and becomes a well regarded judge and suddenly you\nFind out he was a rapist or attempted rape historic gang rape is it's the stupidest Mariel ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys\nAnd let me tell you we all like women but we're all nice guys like the date when we don't like to raped women I've never heard anything so outrageous and so stupid and my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nIn the name she provided indicate that she's not telling the truth the

life and I think maybe dined by dying harder he ended up\nSomething she worked for the Democratic party far as I'm concerned the only good thing she did it she said after the fact that there's no possible way I Would bring charges against him in a real courtroom well OK big deal could argue that find me a lawyer\nThey get them in a real courtrooms okay thank you\nI Would say after everything

they're doing they don't even understand the law for God's sakes anybody can charge anything\nAnybody without a shred of evidence you cannot move forward with the word of one person in the hospital for thirty six years ago and and so she didn't even ... even with that either a ...\nPerson if right thinking mind whenever you Brett Kavanaugh Lindsey Graham by the way my hero yeah saying yes it was

are uncorroborated and it's fair to say they are refuted by two key important critical pieces of evidence number one courting the Washington Post the notes of her own therapist do not confirm her story\nOut of her own mouth that the therapist word drug suppressed by her and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen better refuted by her story of twenty sixteen and twenty aging how is it possible the media does make it a big deal when her own therapists notes\nDo not confirm that truthfulness over story and secondly the eye witnesses that she says we're present\nRefute her story there don't corroborated their refuted\nAnd labeling Kaiser her best girlfriend\nEspecially legal in Kaiser the girlfriend said have no memory of this didn't know whether it happen or not it didn't happen that

the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly eyes that we find out she was all over the world\nAh and also just the holes in our story said thank thank God for ... people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham because\nBecause Brett without Brett cabinet or Lindsey Graham's defense there was no other Republican up there will know than Brett Kavanaugh\nNo in fact judge you know Jeff flex hiding out in an elevator as you get to Ted Cruz type of salt\nAh from some screaming woman who says look me in the ... I would've said lady I'm On your side I'm not in favor of sexual assault we're trying to find out the truth you know I mean do you believe every woman who said she was sexually assaulted if that's the case the ... the Duke lacrosse team would all be locked up\nAnd they use UVA Rolling Stone story never would have happened\nAbout ten to twenty percent of these stories are dishes\nEighty Ninety percent of legitimate well\nWhich is you know nobody's going to have a car stolen until the police have just Chevy one it really it's a Ford so but but in the area of sexual assault things of that character tend to twenty percent of the time there's false memory or false information given very motive and in this case\nSome Thirty years went by into twenty twenty twenty twelve when she was in a conference or their husband Russell be goes or marriage difficult is because she wanted to front doors Thirty years later and that's the first time the therapist took notes\nAnd the therapist notes her own therapist do not confirm her story according to the Washington Post then she would not give her therapist notes under HIPAA rules to the United States Senate but she gave it to the Washington Post\nAnd the nose to the therapist and not contained in a bread cabinet and they had different numbers of individuals is holding her so the therapists notes the knocked infirmary story in fact in obstructed or story but they send it seemed to ignore that too\n[noise] why it seems like everybody on a laptop and wants to ignore all the holes and you cannot like you said that's what I Want to withstand a court of law and any jury that would look at the testimony would not find the evidence\nYou know I heard a lot of the finest the mess wondrous I call them on the left I say that survivors must be the lead a well we believe that they have been assaulted but\nWe don't necessarily need to take their word for as to who if they can't protect the president how did Dr forget to the party\nShe wasn't drunk when she went to the party I sort of six miles from the party how she got home she has a very selective memory and like I said I'm not saying something traumatic happened\nDinner I Believe that at some point in life at some point in her life it probably did\nCraft but she did not display to me like the burden of proof that I needed to believe that it was Dr Brett Kavanaugh and also what saved his has why if I Do believe that this father\nBy keeping a diary a calendar of sorts and without Brett Kavanaugh's calendar it would certainly come down to ... he said she said and the Democrats want to use these weaponized sexual allegations as political tool I think Dr Christine for nothing more than a political ... on\nThe Democrat Party while they choose to ignore other women who have come forward with crab credible evidence\nThat ugly act on Keith Ellison that that that these fancy vice chair\nThe second most powerful Democrat in the party including a candidate for internal general for a Minnesota has to credible allegations with police report Dr reports text messages and allegedly a video that ... that ... that's\nProving or at least getting assignments that he allegedly emotionally and physically abused no less than two women\nAnd I'll give you another part of this or you know it's like the dog that didn't bark she told the committee the primary impact to the event occurred during the four years directly after she said she went on to struggle academically I struggled at a Chapel Hill and in college when I was Seventeen I was off to college at a very tough time\nShe skips completely her junior and senior year in high school I guarantee you if there were a bad grades are bad behavior by her her junior and senior in high school the to academic years after the event took place when she was Fifteen Years old\nThat would have been a dog that barked we would have found out that you've flown data vice go that you did poorly\nAnd so how is it possible that you did well in high school good enough to get into a Chapel Hill which is our school to get in to\nGet three advanced degrees including two masters and a doctorate right sixty five books in periodicals travel all over the world to to Haiti and South America and Europe\nAnd uh in Israel and she went to a she went to Hawaii nine times she seemed objectively there'll be full life what she would have written Seventy five books except for this terrible event\nHow come we've not heard about what ... what happened to her academically entered junior and senior year I made you the reason is they didn't do it and she did quite well\nWhich is the dog that did not bark and there was no objective indicator and why would she left the house with their best friend leaned Kaiser girlfriends still there if there was two purported attempted rapist running around drunk\nHow'd you get out of there who took her home why didn't you know to find a girl\nHow'd you get out of there who took her home why didn't you notify the girls the next\nThe next day at the swimming club but at the country club or or the first day of class she told nobody counsellors mom and dad girlfriend\nShe kept it secret for Thirty years then had a recovered memory and psychological services counseling session because she wanted a second front door and how is it her lawyers got away with lying\nFor ten days about her wanting to drive from California to Washington when in fact she was staying in Delaware at that time and flying all over the country why wasn't that a bigger deal because you've flight outlined\nWhy doesn't the another example of a Democrat using women as political pawns for tools and that's a political assassination gate and that's just the politics of personal destruction they want it the political theater\nThey want it to expose her someone dead stomach exposed to she was and somewhat made sure that she would have cameras and lights and a national audience in front of the Senate Judiciary committee that was set up in order to try to make the old white men\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee they're all white Republican I'm from a bad you know Steve King tweeted out just the other day and I say that's about all white men are relentlessly being racially and generationally profile by the tolerant lapse in air quotes tolerant\nLeftist media outlets and politicians almost universally profiled and stigmatized Republican senators\nBooks like racial profiling is back in style if you are left us for not only as an old white men that were going to question her or Brett Kavanaugh as an old white privilege to guide at the Sacramento Bee or when he was crying that's just what white privilege looks like\nYeah so they they they call it a massage or their crime Republicans massage it is an old white men and that's coming directly from the vicious violent violent laugh and missing dress the feminist\nMostly to the woman that crave unanimity demanded a public forty million audience to listen to her story she was never properly cross examined\nAnd uh and the questioning from the Democrats was laughable and and at this point uh what's gonna happen later this week do you think you're making bars of Reagan babe dot com\nI assume the FBI Thursday Friday is going to give largely clean bill of health that will may not be sufficient Jeff Flake whose last name that should be an edge the gym and not a ... not a no\nAh I I guess she's going to he's going to vote for unless he's pigeonholed by another Ted Cruz CBGB's screaming out I'm In an elevator God Knows what's going to have to get all your crystal ball what happens later this week [noise]\n[noise] well I'm I think I heard ... however now that we've given the Democrats or their weight and then you know far for the seven FBI investigation I uh Brett Kavanaugh\nI'm sure that Michael ... or by the glory alright well up here\nWith another victim I mean right now they're probably scraping the Yale yearbooks to see what they can come up with\nBecause the truth doesn't matter to the Democrats it's simply the perception it's simply the narrative and they can use their buddies in the media in order to further to the fame and destroy a potentially and allegedly assume a plea innocent man\nBut they can try to ruin him in a court of public opinion because it benefits that politically\nAnd Megan they couldn't care less about sexual assault victims they couldn't care less about Christine forward that's why they able to lead to our identity\nTo have ... they want it to weaponize sexual assault the way they weaponize the Oscars the way they weaponize television shows the way they weaponize Murphy Brown the way they weaponize Oscars they way they weaponize Grammys in public education whatever it is\nThe socialist progressive just want to weaponize\nAnd take up someone's cause as long as it fits their agenda but Keith Ellison\nOr or Clinton or the Kennedys did not fit the agenda of the modern Democratic Party so they're completely ignore the provable Keith Ellison vicious assault on his girlfriend's because that doesn't fit their agenda but a weaponized Christine forward does\nAbsolutely so they're using her as a political upon like they've done many other when I when we look at for example Harvey Weinstein remember NBC turned down the Harvey Weinstein story or he was a big Democrat donor you with a very powerful Democrat man and he could run the narrative through hit media companies for the Democratic party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city":
