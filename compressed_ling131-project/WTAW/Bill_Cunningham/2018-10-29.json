is a is journalistic gymnastics\nThat would make Mary Lou Retton jealous it's unbelievable how they could did how they could say that the only president in American history loved by the Israelis they're naming boulevards after Trump the only president in American history with Jewish grandchildren\nThat the only president in American history that move the embassy\nTo Jerusalem is somehow anti

someone like Senator Chuck Schumer to be the Democratic leader how do you do that\nSo uh what's your thinking and I were standing Nunberg well on Monday or Tuesday coming up next as David re\nThere's been a lot of reporting and now CNN stop reporting it because it's good for Trump about tens of thousands coming here from uh El Salvador\nNicaragua and a hug doors\nAnd the health concerns about their health concerns when thousands of human beings are not inoculated numerous dozens of different diseases they have not been\nChecked and they were living in squalid conditions for weeks walking through heating jungles and what the medical risk my feet when that when that\nCould arise in Texas [noise]\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impossible for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand and deserts that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there is Fifteen and twenty thousand why not Fifteen to twenty million\nWell you know there are forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I wanted a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum\nAnd they are in like Flynn they are here they're going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years\nNever showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploited the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states this is a gimmick\nThey're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes\nAnd they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked to ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for mass illegal immigration when you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them end up registering as Democrat\nIn Columbus I forgot to government assistance but\nYeah I mean if you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies\nAnd ah you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and every one for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read in democratic literature is that if and when Texas flips to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state the way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years there will be no chance for Republican ever to win the presidency again in Texas is a blue state\nAnd you might throw in Florida because California for most of its history was a deep red state run them re gray haired it easily mixing dared raised ... California flip it goes the legal migration\nTerry who's in the next target Texas flips and it's over but David Wray affair here here's a question\nTrump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects mid western values conservative values\nHe's saying the army or the national guard will not let them cross in America how do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one show into American soil then blaming political refugee status how\nPhysically we're not going to shoot them there's well ... how do you actually stop 'em\nThat's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I'm ...\n... that that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you how you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona or to come over\nThat's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states and we're done and you and you're done and orange on the long list oh yeah and all we need to do is\nAnd so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nTo ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have an end of this nonsense we can't get those loopholes closed now Congress failed twice\nThey're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that\nAnd and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in you know\nHere's the problem in very poor takes ten Democrats the United States Senate to move legislation right now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election\nWhatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot in the taxes they're thrown back immediately into Mexico and you're done we ever a loophole in the law that\nThere are thrown back immediately in Mexico and you're done\nWe every loophole when the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa and you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally and you claim refugee status for political purposes but then you begin and the hearing process that takes three to ten years so unless the Democrats agree to do this\nNo change in the law will happen I mean Trump God Bless him I Love him or he can tell tough all he wants\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America claiming refugee status\nThey have no shot they have no medical Clarence they have no financial support they have no work skills that we need most Democrats than a third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees\nAnd what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest up their own political and Chris is that my pipe dream yeah\nNo it won't happen now that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\n[noise] yeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do and his best bet is to try to get the Mexican to stop them in Mexico\nBecause once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk you know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol they'll run towards them\nTo ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border with these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this\nA stick with us till we get that back in turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mess\nI mean I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I yeah unless\nMexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and the only thing is not going to happen is the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan\nAt the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this and so unless they get hammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and\nThe Democrats get hurt in the Senate ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats United States senators\nTo get the same treatment as Central Americans that we get the Mexicans\n... which means they're here illegally immediately or send back they'll have to go through a hearing process the liberal activist attorneys are there are the news media is their\nKamala Harris and all the rest are just loving this and the goal David raid there thinking strategically is make Texas a deep blue state and if that happens that Republicans are D. U. N. and done\nWell you know ... it's a great political strategy if you're a Democrat because they're scaring Americans way left and right so you're only option left his to import future citizens and they are going to do that from central in Latin America\nAnd you know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have caravans ... of a tens of thousands of people coming towards our southern border this ... of actually be stopped by Congress until then Trump can build his wall\nE can uh put up are the types of a deterrent that we have on the border to house families together get their asylum cases turned around quickly and then start working on the seven hundred thousand case backlog of a sigh leads who are currently in the U.S\nYou know huge problem now that you have to have the political will to do it you have to have the infrastructure to do it in the United states has to be serious about a closing these asylum loopholes\nIn the Democratic party will not let the Republicans be serious about it in the mainstream media covers this only as women with children marching down your feet", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "29"}
