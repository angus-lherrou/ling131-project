about an hour or so we have diamond in Sacramento going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line much like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern Democratic Party to keep them in line\nLet's continue thirty minutes after they are do counting on the great American live with you every something [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south\nWhere so many jobs and talking about are we talking about Canada and Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs to potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariffs people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which has absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair\nUh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was it Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said\nListen we're not call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and interested that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nWe built a sign of wearing underwear showing the year five trillion over ten we've don't Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect you know what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it said twenty five percent\nSo we're taking and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it\nSo China has been like China is the biggest of them are by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade Louis we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over bill\nLeslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house Schumer text the Senate your life becomes miserable the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls away it look we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the mid term relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ... you have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to vote one percent Rasmussen federally one now we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it\nBecause when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's at Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what it means\nA we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice Kavanaugh's Fifteen judge at her Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five and it'll be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans look and so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law unintended consequences because since I've been many women were spurred my air Nobel I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base from otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate that you've been a very terrific guy and so you're also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know showing us great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we can pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls\nIf you look three weeks ago and you look now it's like especially with regard to shock her when she was she was ... points down now she's four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee that almost all of them\nNow I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh it's unfortunate because he's such a good\nMan I mean I don't know Sherrod Brown says socialist but you know he sees a lot of Trump voters they're voting for ... he's going around in a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world the ads are like Trump pads he talks about you\nI Know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time out six weeks after it's over so it's one of those things but I Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for ... capital when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him\nBut I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election midterms I think frankly I think people are viewing this is very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers yeah people ... they are

the best most vivid example of evil that we have seen in modern civilization and that Germany in World War two\nAnd how ordinary shopkeepers and farmers and bankers could put on black uniforms now with the debt said insignia on their cap [noise] go into concentration camps and kill babies no\nOrdinary people yeah\nAll right so that scenario once you start to read it and understand it [noise] it

are private time together our discussion\n... was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find it very good because you get you're going to get a sense of the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think here tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nSo I'm an air that interview and in a few minutes and the president also extremely complimentary things to say about me for which I'm most appreciative and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity\nAnd my friend Sean Compton [noise] and then also their friendship with the president [noise] uh I'm not sure he would invited me to to meet with him on friday night and a couple\nOf nights ago and I also taught you asked me what I thought how I thought he was doing\nIn the mid west so I gave my thoughts\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet\nThey show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and onions and we charge him essentially no tax it's sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and an ... that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nWe'd be able to find a way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we'd don't Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's gonna come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do a version but we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been look China is the biggest several\nMall by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over bill\nNow Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls\nBelow sea takes the house Schumer takes the Senate your life becomes\nMiserable at the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what we don't want Bedford Falls away it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the midterms relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ... you have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to get me one percent Rasmussen fit we know now we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it\nBecause when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means that the Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what it means\nA we have to do well\nI Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabin on Fifteen jobs that are that Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn the law banana consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air Nobel I with Kevin Oh they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base

you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know showing us great but these are great people and great talents and I appreciate it do we have to do well

she's she's nine points down now she's four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee that almost all of them\nNow I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh\nIt's unfortunate because he's such a good man I mean I don't know Sherrod Brown's socialist but you know he sees a lot of Trump voters are voting for sure he's going around and a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world the ads are like Trump pads he\nTalks about you know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time at six weeks after it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for ... capital when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him\nBut I just want to thank you
