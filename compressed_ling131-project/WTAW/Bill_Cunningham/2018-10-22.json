was an employer Washington Post he was in an American\nAnd so let you and I assume for the sake of argument which the Saudis at this point more or less have confirmed that an unsuspecting Jamal ... walked into a Saturday a consulate in this demand turkey in stumbled turkey to be tortured and killed over a seven minute period\nNow that's bad not good but\nSeven minute period and that's bad not good but\nThose things happen in that part of the world all the time if you steal something you drop off your hands men and women are hang or use source to drop their heads off on a regular basis\nA woman who commits adultery stoned to death in the public square\nMass the violence is happening all the time and not part of the world according to CNN especially we're now supposed to get twisted in a notch\nAnd drop our support of the president and want to blow up America's relationship with Saudi Arabia which could cost us a half a trillion dollars and now Saudi Arabia has a relationship with Israel\nAs a counterbalance against Iran ... drop all of that because a Saudi Arabian\nWas killed in Turkey\nI don't get it I don't understand and the other thing\nThe moral outrage felt by CNN is not shared by them when a police officer is killed\nFor example\nAn officer Jason Alice was killed in May of ah twenty uh Thirteen about five years ago his killer is not been apprehended CNN did not even a report is death\nThis year in America about one hundred cops are going to be killed the great majority of the perpetrators will be located but on the other hand some what I'll be located\nYou mean to tell me that the death of ... ... has more impacted my life and the death of a police officer or the death of a truck driver\nOr the murder of a college student in Iowa or a school teacher or a child innocent kids are kidnapped and raped in America all the time young black men about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago\nWomen are raped and brutalized tortured on a regular basis ... inside of America much less in other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on a murder in Turkey\nBecause if it's a journalist excuse me ... without a journalist there was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but\nEven if he was quote a journalist does that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I\nI'm waiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any of their you know who they are\nTo me because show the narrative as a hostile it's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize and his death\nAs a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nBut I guarantee you he his wife is no more value than a truck drivers lied for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses lie for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time in American elsewhere so why is the death\nOf a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news because the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there's those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that\nAnd I thought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if when Trump says bad things about journalist\nSo Maui indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show geek in Turkey who Nell believes this crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue on the\nLine becomes available to never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing is tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand\nFound to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that ... if he was my father if he was my brother\nUh I'd be outrage at is that that was ... it should not have died Saudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year\nGive me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't\nBecause the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us about a brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nThey want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea\nThey must have nothing else to talk about\nLet's continue when we do is go right to the ... [noise]\nOne becomes available you know the routine go hunting emigrate America [noise]\nFired up to live with you\nThey just fall under over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background\nOf the best spot for tourists African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nI Know and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing\nFloating around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right to boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama had the relationship and Heller had the relationship and you can stay in the media didn't cover that at all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on\nNPR that work to our to our to our show every week and and they make three hundred thousand dollars plus a year now see that's fine except I don't want to subsidize it you know ... you know why should we pay rent the ... PBS but you don't like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks and Amazon\nLet them pay for it or people that like that in San Francisco or Boston but why is the average deplorable taxpayer subsidized in the yard that the clowns they have one that that station on a regular basis worker level by as a propaganda\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears and thousand radio station there's five hundred television stations but we taxpayer subsidized PBS and NPR for what reason what what's the purpose is because they're left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no ... that's why it's done\nRight well I'm not for killing people but I mean he only works you know like it's not a nice after utopian world it's like ... in a ... human life is very cheap around the world and you know but people who pick and choose their atrocities and their best spots or should be kept them\nAnd and that's that the media thank you\nAnd your great thank you for your call is going to the gym in Chicago the belly of the beast gym in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Jim go ahead\nThank you sir [noise] just to let you know I uh I have a home in San Pedro Sula Honduras and I'm also a resident of the country and I'm totally opposed to what's growing up going on\nAnd tell me you spent time in Honduras talk about the circumstances and violent the economy is\nIt's it's kinda like it because if you live in Chicago 'cause I live in Chicago and all you hear about from people that love other places they ... they're talking about Al Capone violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure\nAnd there's a lot of stability in that area is however [noise]\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant or food it's Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you are like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent tax for a drink at a restaurant you know and plus the value of the ... been sliding to the dollar is not the twenty four limbs per dollar used to be just a few years ago it was like twenty\nJune had announced the guy is the government democratically elected one isn't\nWell this last election there was a big uh uh this name as his initials or a jail age because he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years [laughter] and then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get their legislature\nTo make a two terms and people that liked it and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed 'em [noise]\nUh they're they're called the ... they're called cloud as what they did is they close on all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended flights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time you know they have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths [noise]\nUh and they they just burn them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls and that's a that's a major hit you know and and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days\nAnd you could hear the gunfire in the background 'cause San Pedro like a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nOr do you what's the what's the life for the average Honduran oh what's it like well\nIf you have money you do well if you're poor you don't want to be there because there's no public assistance\nTo the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise] but you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful you know it's it's so it's like it's mixed\nYou know I've been going there for thirty something years in fact my ex wife I'm a his from there and that was part of the attraction I went there and I have two daughters with her they're teenagers now and I'm Still good with my my in laws and things it's nice but you know you gotta be careful you don't want to do that does this deal with anybody because it's a good chance we could get hurt\nIn Illinois now you said you're again Hondurans Guatemala and El Salvador and Nicaragua is coming to America why are you against it\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy they sleep a lot of this is being ... funded by the left is you know George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy and resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own\nGovernment saying stay in your country and fix your own country while he's blind leading the best and the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it's really in the long term interest is what\nHappens a lot of people with means a lot of hunter as they should have gone to Spain now and a lot of them come illegally here you know in fact I hate to say that's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal the transaction [noise] and he got off right they got killed right before Christmas\nSo you don't go forward you get a gun and kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist visa and he left his beyond he's done in the California for the last five years he's staying here is ...\n... you're going to get married is going to try to get us paperwork the these are the marriage so a lot of people with resources have left and come over here and then try to stay here you know by getting married he was doing something else to become legal\nRight it's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for a for electricity it's all diesel powered a generation it's not a fishing is expensive\nAnd they keep raising the price of energy [laughter] you know my water bills going up you know like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting worse it's\nNothing but it could be a better manage just put it that way\nWell who's doing the man and she is in a military democratically elected it doesn't matter and Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know\nBut that's all kind of died down now but the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into Dallas so to speak you know things keep getting out of sight it's just like that as well you\nKnow as that as well but it's the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nToys there's about a thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua thirty five\nI mean people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many will come to America given a choice of the Democrats got in charge and a complete open borders how many would come\nBy privacy mall [laughter] all of them [laughter] forty million right that would come\nBut you know it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter stores but however stores you'll see the American flag you'll sit on the wall she lives there so there in fact I was even that does is getting off the side or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to make Honduras the fifty first date of you know like oh my God\n[laughter] and the reason why is because people if we if we can come and run their country and give it to look at it with people would jump to that and it would be more patriotic\nAnd you didn't have a gym thank you but ... years in fact during the violent death writing on doors at Ninety five per one hundred

that's the question differently because Howard Stern with lamb Kooning me on his show in a Robin quiver then I said yeah Well Howard I'd really like you know I wrote an an an article about it I really like you to tell me what you call somebody who accuses you being a not only a rape is put a serial rapists\nAnd essentially a person uh that that that would be despicable and in any way shape way

six six six or seven seven three three somebody coming up next to Peter Wallison written a fabulous book about the fourth branch of\nGovernment and what we the American people can do to continue with more cutting it live with you every Sunday [noise]\nOf um of administrative agencies then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because his best reflects the will of the people in reality at least for the past fifty years it was perceived Congress is number one\nIt was received the president's number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the presidency is the most powerful number two is the court number three is the Congress the Congress\nIs feckless foolish any realm and and so what were the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen eighty seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today when that Congress is foolish and cyclists\nI think it would be amazed amazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agency is not the president actually it's administrative agency which even the president doesn't control [noise] they'd given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general better set of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's tremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in\nThe details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws then they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nThat's the administrative agency and what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the congressman did not vote for legislation that restricted\nThe independent agency in what it was a boy or what it was able to produce the laws with just two general and what will happen now if the court access I Hope they will ask you\nIs that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say this you did not have this authority no you are not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nAnd of course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings and the confirmation\nBrent Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact that uh the United States Congress is exceedingly weak and not really a because there are so weak\nThe liberals the progressive want to use the court system do impose like legislation on we the American people because they're so unpopular\nWhether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America and the Congress or foolish in fact was therefore they look toward the court system to be a second legislature and that was never intended by anybody in\nFact one might argue to go back to your original point the administrative state is more powerful than the United States Congress and might be more powerful and the most powerful branch of government is ... is the administrator state\nSomething called the deep state that have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president and outlast accord and continue to exist so it is the administrator state right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that\nAnd there is a way to address that and as I say and I think it's the courts were just at the end on a read the statute as they were written by Congress they would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far and to the extent that they do that\nWe have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be\nTo force Congress to begin to act because if what the administrative agency has done something that the American people would like and the courts have said\nNo you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want legislation that does miss 'em if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies\nWill will not be able to make the room anyway but the point is we're a democracy and in a democracy the people's views should prevail and that's not what's happening and the under the current law system\nGive me an example of four or five years ago Obama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent said I'm not the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against that\nBy by the time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when he came to legal immigration and he just created new laws out of a ... that had nothing to do with the Congress and by the time that gets up to\nNew laws out of a salad there that had nothing to do with the Congress and bought a time that gets up to the United States Supreme court and takes one to three years to even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done with the dreamers are going to do and you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the eyes or ins\nThe president can do anything you want why why can't the next president doing anything he wants in other words it isn't a substance it it's the rule making ability of the administrators state that ... that have been they've usurped their power that Congress\nYeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally the Supreme Court\nDoes not act one this is the Supreme Court lays down a rule that says this is the we are going to be reading statutes as they were written\nA then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last year\nMany times is district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they're able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not has not placed any kinds of strict limitations on what the court can do in fact\nWhat the what the Supreme Court has done in this so called Chevron case the central he said to the to the court you should defer to what the administrative agency\n[laughter] and interpreting their own law yeah and that of course has given them license to do whatever they want\nYou know I have to stop I took home your book last night to read a ... page Ninety four\nNow you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago on may twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton did in the White House but in Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine\nOr rules forty ... rules which you know now is a lot well and twenty Seventeen the cumulative final rules publishing the federal register\nAs a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty so it goes from forty three hundred under Clinton do one on one thousand three hundred and eighty and it's like ... at the rate at three to four thousand new rules every year and by the time another ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand rules\nAre well that's entirely possible the way things are going right now of course the hundred thousand a hundred and one that that is killing me and that that number since ... since Nineteen Ninety three right um but yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of this Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court and it says\nCongress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation out of power in our country\nI Want to share the American people people when I was a thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the cumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty twelve which is what a a thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by\nOver twenty five percent which amounts to annually Thirteen thousand per person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing\nAnd the only entity that can truly stop it and the president can't stop it that Congress could stop it but they're fools and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it is not a state Supreme Court\nBecause can you imagine our economy twenty five percent larger\nBecause ridiculous rules and regulations Jim another back one other one thousand three hundred and eighty it's now October twenty Eighteen I assume another three thousand rules going to go into effect\nSo unless Brett Kavanaugh and other four justices said this is unconstitutional it will continue well we got her on end up Peter Jay Wallace into bogus judicial fortitude the last chance to rein in the administrators state\nAnd Peter thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and you're a great American\n[laughter] that fact ...\nGod Bless you God Bless America let's continue with more can you smell when I'm cooking", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "College Station",
