Peterson live from Los Angeles California turned my cabin on more and now African Americans finally are winding up there's been some polling that seemed to indicate\nThat the president has about a thirty percent approval rating\nAmong African American and if that's the case the Democratic party is done it's a minimalist party from the coast\nIn from major city uses a sea of red right now to see the sun\nAnd the plaques return to their traditional Republican home it's over for the modern Democrats Jesse ... Peterson is still counting of the great American live with you\nShe made a promise of black people that the Republicans were trying to tear down the projects\nAnd ... and ... and the ghetto right but she said I'm not gonna let Republicans do that and not all that are not going to let them turn out to projects I'm going to be more for you\nAnd she's making that kind of promising to black voters in her district while she's living in a four point three million dollar home suburbs she goes to how to be concerned about the crime and violence is happening in those areas\nHow is it possible that the worst place for an African American to live in America is in a black congressional district no matter where it is you take the twenty five or thirty blocks rational districts\nAnd it's the worst place for black folks to live anywhere in the country\nBut there are so good at a voting responsibility for the implementation and the results of their policies are so good at blaming\nEveryone but themselves\n... will black folk ever look at themselves and say look at our status\nWhat do you have to lose would ever look at themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying wait a minute we have lousy education systems we have no job creation we're rampant crime rampant abortion rapid welfare and the Democratic party's been here for fifty or sixty years\nAnd it's amazing to me you're going to have this little result blaming everyone else to take no responsibility like Maxine Waters\nAnd that could probably here that they are not going to get better for them until they do take a look at themselves and they ... responsibility for their own lives\nAnd until they realize that the Democrats have been lying to them for Seventy years or so\nAnd uh they never intended and they never were doing the same for them they don't want them better they want them brainwashed job down and demoralized because that's how you control them\nYou can't control a more personal and more people you have to the mall I have yet to keep them angry and whatever that Democrats want more power whenever they want to get in a a boat\nBig crowd racism because they know they could crowd is phony ideal racism that most of the ice will go into a hip not attract and walk right into the voting booth and vote for the Democrats that's why they keep using that\nAnd it's not going to change it to the glass take responsibility and into why people stop being afraid of the phony words blacks are suffering not because those a lot of racism but due to the lack of moral character the destruction of the family and living on as supportive of the Democratic plantation bill\nWell you know in Chicago look one McDonnell was a young man who was threatening large numbers of people with a knife they didn't know what the time he was with PCP\nWhich is a crazy drug and then he was shot by cop who made a mistake the cop should not have shot him the way he was shot he was kind of walking away from the ... made a split second life and death decision that was wrong cops are Todd\nThan somebody has a knife within Twenty one feet of your being it takes less than a second for them to take the ... so now it looks like one lives in Chicago can be misused to advance their political agenda which has had cops\nAt the same time seven hundred Americans living in Chicago will be dead this year four thousand are going to get shot and including that boy putting the barrel and put on fire there is no marches no protests milk scream and holler none about a little boy and a barrel who wouldn't joined a gang\n... that's like moves on but if you can find years ago as you go about their may made a mistake\nThat becomes a fundraising tool\nAs a matter of fact when there's a black or white or black cop or white or black situation they celebrate that they love it when that happened because it opened up to as you just said is open up opportunities for fundraising\nThey can accuse why people making a lot and just see the black and white people and it's all for the purpose of more power well for themselves they don't care about black people they don't care about white people they don't care about illegal aliens they don't care about the children\nThey care about gaining power and wealth and so that's why they jump on those type of situation pushed in lie\nThat the cops are held by low to the police brutality and they support a a like cabin or a cat for Nick they can put the dog to a deal and then turning their backs on the fly around the country\nAre at the football games because they want the far right there that is to why Republicans but it's about power and wealth for the Democratic party and no one else\nWell Jesse you and I have a lot more yesterdays tomorrow is yes and\nUh I like to think each of us from Cincinnati and from Los Angeles had some minimal impact\nIn the lives of those who might want to listen and change and in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folks can you tell us in Los Angeles I see a little bit in Cincinnati but in Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico\nIt's devastating\nIf the world really knew\nDestructive is over there are in South central LA style like cops in watts\nThere it will be ... years ago they would demand that the the the police officer the government do something to be illegal alien game members of upcoming have come in first number one they're taking away day labor day jobs some blacks who can't get rid of a job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there and do a\nWho can't get rid of a job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there and do a bit by less energy drives and the crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA is beyond\nA words is devastate a lot of blacks and leave it faster I later moved back to the south they move into a Oregon an average donor place like that they're looking for a safe haven because Matthew Warner's Senate black leadership over there would not do anything about it\nAnd the media and others are given a farce impression\nThat black or Hispanic again all alone they are not they hate one another they hate the fact that these people coming in and taken over their schools and neighborhoods and jobs ... it's so bad that at one point but the trip to the blood has joined forces to fight against Daley good game members\nBecause they they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing and the Los Angeles school system is a hundred of Nineteen different languages and dial yes\nOne cannot function in an environment where every student who is speaking a different language or dialect is entitled to under federal law that a person that they're said to translate everything happening in class one can imagine the chaos when you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students\nSpeaking maybe twenty or thirty different languages which no one is understood in behavior in norms are not followed and mom and dad don't exist at the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that's the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I you know I work with a lot of black kids from those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that\nThe teachers are put into focus on the one that kept the image and put it into focus more focused on an illegal alien than they are the citizens and so and the parents are not paying attention because most of the kids are coming from single pair hold a black women who were born in America those who were born in this country\nSeventy seven percent of their children are bored out of wedlock so they don't have parents who are paying attention and the kids are feeling I Lived in ... at home and ask who they're just drop it out and hardly a day goes by without a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd the and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to because I Can't find or just\nYou're an educated men maybe a lot of self taught like I Am but I cannot imagine being a black kid\nIn Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York here sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know you're a functionally illiterate\nYou can't go to high school because you're kicked out or do learn a damn thing nothing's being taught you have no job future you have no capability of forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property that as devastating and that is the light\nAnd that is the life and a lot of literally tens of millions of black and Brown in poor white kids in America today and I don't see do you see anything changing\nA short of a miracle from God I don't see it you know a non profit organization bond\nThe Brotherhood organization over new destiny for the last twenty eight years now we have been rebuilding their family by rebuilding their mass so we were able to help some of those boys from those areas but\nIt's overwhelming at this point and its special that the government the ACLU and they and a CPA and others are covered it up\nBecause they just power well it just seemed like a hopeless situation right now\nAnd in fact in most almost all of the urban areas in this country Donald Trump Republican Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell got nothing to do with running the large cities in this country they're all Democrats so if something's wrong educationally crime why something wrong with the welfare state something wrong with\nLike a job creation oh what is in the media and lay down at the doorstep of the Democratic party\nBecause they they don't want to they look media is advocate for the Democratic party the liberals they hate the country they hate was right they hate good\nAnd they could use that people for personal gain whenever they want to gain power they have especially agenda\nThey say hey you're just feminine against us", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "08"}
