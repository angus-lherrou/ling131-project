have a law that if you're a newsstand you have to sell news and they actually said he told me they send out people to force that laws but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and\nFrom what I've seen some news fans will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or a lot a lot of space to um [noise] selling the newspapers because the Americans are super low and they don't sell very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and\nAnd soda things I have a lot you know much higher margins\nWe're speaking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the newsstands are selling\nThat you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these
