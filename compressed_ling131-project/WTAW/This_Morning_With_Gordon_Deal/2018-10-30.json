the humanity has gone down a lot in the past few years if you say you're interested in classics or\nYou know literature you are more likely to be admitted that if you say you're interested in science or you know engineering and we also found that geographic location matters um Harvard pays special attention to recruiting students from what they call ... country said\nThat include states like Montana Idaho main Arizona et cetera so if you're from the state Arbor is probably you know more likely to try and recruit you than if you're from another state\nBut some of the city or as you point out do a ... a relatively high acceptance reelection New York city or Boston\n[noise] yeah that was also fascinating to look at geographic region the areas with the highest acceptance rates are New

child of someone who has you know an unusual job more so than reading about it in a textbook for example\nRight what was the point about the show how much you love learning\n[noise] though is [laughter] so that got brought up repeatedly at trial also just that they want students who are really passionate about learning just learning for learning sake not just people who\nAre doing it to get good grades essentially so there was one essay that they highlight of that trial um that I thought was pretty amusing and it was\nA student who talked about starting a book club that his high
