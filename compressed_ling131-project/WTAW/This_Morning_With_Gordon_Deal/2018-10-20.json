how do political beliefs figure into these identities Emily ... drew her rights for up shot at the New York times looked at a brief survey Emily would look at\nYou know we were talking about this topic at the upshot because we came across some survey data from the early to thousands where people were asked okay here's a list of identity is which one is most important to you and you know the options are your gender your race your religion that political party that you ... with\nA part of the country that you grow up and and and you know we were sort of surprised by how Americans have answered this question in the past\nA religion ranked really really highly\nFor a lot of people that want it to the most prominent things uh you know sort of ... people family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life wakes really highly and particularly like all the way down at the bottom at this list and\nWe sort of suspected that perhaps even the something different if we ask people to question again today because it feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics in politics there's like a pro bathing everything around us\nAnd so we we surveyed the question that two thousand people and found once again the politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nIt's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live and breathe politics the way Washington news beans who\nRight right we have to remind ourselves of this constantly you know those of us who write about these things for letting that most people out in America are not as obsessed with that if we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's an accelerating of at the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature\nYour religion whether you are religious or non religious heal race they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm In a night\nI Would think that there would

found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap day care and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals a doodle nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during the school day period so a daycare has been\nA really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts that use for day and and talking
