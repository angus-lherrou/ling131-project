at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner Kelly what should we know\nFirst thing you want to be thinking about is what is your insurance coverage because for most people you were looking at homeowners it vandalism crime that's going to be covered\nBut you know when you look at those numbers you know the numbers are up\nYou know these are just claims that are big enough for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a detectable of several hundred dollars before it kicks in so obviously when we're talking about the spike we're talking about big taller claims [laughter] um so you might even have a couple of hundred dollars on the hook for your insurance kicks in\nUm worth it to know what that coverage looks like and then on the auto front with the folks tell us that the insurance information Institute is about eight and ten people have\nUm comprehensive coverage which is going to cover you know vandalism staffed of auto parts all that sort of extra damage that's not a collision so if you're one of those you know to intend that don't have that coverage might be a good time to be making sure that you really are okay with that risk\nThis spike in claims that includes I guess what's on what's called mischief night doubles night the night before Halloween\nYet that was always a big thing when I where I grew up in South Jersey with the night before and travelers when they were pulling in this data they said that they did see a little bit of an up tick the day before but they suspect that you know for most people if there's damage that's occurring at eleven o'clock at night the night before you're probably finding out about it when you wake up on Halloween really they assume that\nThose that spike on Halloween has some wrapped into it from the night before\n... speaking with Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner\nAnd she's written a piece titled Halloween is the scariest day of the year for this financial shock or talk about the jump in insurance claims around Halloween for things like perhaps the damage to your home or your car or what kind of steps can we take to minimize potential damage\nA liability coverage is another thing you want to look at their because that's everything from you know a trick or treat her trips on your steps in in a sustained some injury to if you have a pet um you know maybe they are not as fond of all these costumes and visitors as as you might be um so you want to be thinking about your liability there as well um so\nYou can do things like clear out your yard and sidewalk potential hazards make sure the path through your doors well lit and then consider you know keeping your pets away from the door if you're at all worried about how they're going to react towards\nThe what's the best case for checking for these potential gaps in insurance you might have not all of us read fine print obviously\nI mean it's obviously British and read the fine print if you've been working with an insurance agent or whatever company you're using for your coverage just reach out to them and get a sense of what your coverage might be for some of these things especially for something like liability coverage or dog buy coverage but a lot of variation within their that you know it could be worth a quick phone call him\nUp and then in terms of
