and just had five stars and it was garbled and you knew that that would say that's not really true anymore they're not people are hired to just write reviews and they're getting very good at it [noise]\nUm but there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a fake review in the past year I'm In eighty four percent of them and say hey I don't even know if I can always spot fake review so I just thought you know this is an opportunity to really dig into what is the research showing what experts say\nAbout spotting fake reviews for the first one which I Am not ... but on the exam and the timing of reviews if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time that can be a sign that it does or fake reviews\nOn that because there are a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch a new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if they're if the product just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nOr how about the um this accusation or the investigation and Amazon doing that a newer payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were on that some of its employees mostly in China um we're taking bribes to delete negative reviews and share sales data on banned band account there was a bunch of that that they're investigating it we don't know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean that immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of the reviews who knows what's going on here but it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and if they're fake I mean you're you're

another way uh you said over use of the words I and me and lots of verbs\nYeah this was a huge study coming out at Cornell that found um that online reviews that frequently use by at me are more likely to be fake they don't exactly know why but it could be because when people are lying\nThey try to make themselves sound more credible by using personal pronouns so they're saying I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person doing this um and then they are they also found that the\n... more verbs and then um\nThey more verbs and truth tellers and to tell her to use more now and

for\nThis is another thing from the Cornell SETI okay so this one and it was looking at a hotel reviewed in particular but I think it probably applies to everything\nThat truthful hotel reviews are
