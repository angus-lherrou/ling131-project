haunted house was another scary experiences are not just Halloween events are actually opened a thrill seekers year round\nThat's true and that's what's so crazy about this world is you know obviously we have these things like universal studios horror nights every year but there's this group of people that for that and that's just not enough and they're just looking for the three hundred and sixty five days a year\nYou mentioned heretic de Los Angeles as one of the leaders in extreme haunts what goes on in heretic\nMan it's pretty crazy I'll say that first of all I'll have to admit I'm not a huge horror fan but I spent six hours at\nA hair to ... so I feel like I really really went in it and it was almost a rite of passage for me to watch people go through that but everyone's experience was completely different that something that was really interesting to scare actors\nBasically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read to see if they're going to be more afraid you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then that guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI have heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times go one recently the event included with him stripped his boxers and curled into fetal position taken mud straw unseemly to body fluids his first words afterward that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was that and you know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV\nThey were stripped of their clothes and put in this stress base here and they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there and they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking him through all of them is that they were supposed to make\nAnd they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there's a man let on fire running around screaming all these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and\nThey ended up in this tent in the back in the pitch black with all this fog\nAnd this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and starts rationing them around and\nRich the spacesuit are stripped him down to their underwear and is just nearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest than yeah so the majority of these participants that ended up in the fetal position in their underwear and\nWhat was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking wow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property and kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would give it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some ... of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys was kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred them but you know\nThey actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching rural\nAnd these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck but they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with circus scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward there are all about it\nThis

time\nYeah yeah that's a good point um in point number two you talked about uh using money to create special times with friends and families you said maybe a sporting event or are going to the theater dinner out with friends but in some circles I could see where that would be considered frivolous spending money you should put in your pocket\nYeah there are all kinds of spending that that other people think it's for less than I think it was a while but it's really goes back to the previous point about experiences\nYou know the research tells us that experiences deliver more happiness possessions one of the reasons that experience is to live a more happiness is because they tend to be activities that we do with friends and family\nIf you go to a sporting event if you go to the theater if you go out to dinner with friends not only can you have a great experience but you wouldn't be doing it with friends and family and\nAnd I feel afterwards you can talk about it with um you
