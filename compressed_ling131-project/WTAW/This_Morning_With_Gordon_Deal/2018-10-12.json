Gordon deal most of us get paid every two weeks but for some that creates financial hardship pocket watches Maria lasagna is here with the information on some on demand payment companies that let you decide when you're paid Maria how does this work\nIt's kind of a common problem you know we don't really get to the side typically how often we get paid our company decides that but the issue is that so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something\nElse come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so\nNow we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check 'em but not as alone more strict you know they might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\n[noise] what kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called event and they're only client right now is Walmart but they say they're going to be expanding\nThey are just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interests that you can pay on a on a\nPayday loan if it's relatively small\nUm I talked to another company called daily pay and they said therapy they're more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than from those interest rates end up being\nVery as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reasons for that I think going into the story I thought you know there must be some tax rate than or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that\nUm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nThough it already is actually um you know\n... ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square um and so now that those\nType of ... workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payment cycles um you know every day workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets\nPaid every day or every ride why can't the top and for me so that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and it kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that that is part of the national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that that the benefit for their workers\nSome of these companies are actually you know that that allow you to outsource that are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often so we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nNext Maria Maria like money market watches

are realizing they'd been missing what are the most important traits of all humility you should uh Shellenbarger has written a story for the wall Street Journal about the humble boss and joins us now to what some of the traits of humble people\nHumble people are able to inspire teamwork and others learning and high performance partly by just being all they're interested in others viewpoints they respond well to feed back there they don't try to hide their own mistakes and\nThey set an example of behaviors that their team members tend to follow which fosters a real college all cooperative attitude which it's a smooth they're functioning teams it's subtle but it can be very powerful a in getting teams moving in the right direction\nTo what a person is aware of his or her own weakness in the past that was seen as a weakness and how has this changed\nI think we're a the the top down command and control I Am invincible leader didn't work relatively well in the you know the sort of\nVertical company for the past where it was a chain of command that went up and down I think now we're having much more collaboration among teens across different departments um\nInnovation is coming from all levels at all times and it's really hard for a command and control leader to keep a finger in every pie humble leaders are better able to kind of move among all the teams and inspire\nReally open and honest conversation and interaction so that team's work better together on it's more than a change even in just quit companies want it's a change in the structure of how we're getting work done\nSo what's wrong with the leader who in the past was charming and charismatic\nAbsolutely nothing and in fact some of those people can also\nBe humble it is that if you're a humble year like this and make a person who sits in a corner I'm humbled people can also be ambitious for their team's not necessarily for themselves and they can be charismatic to they can get excited\nAbout the mission that we all share and really get people pumped up for doesn't work so much as\nThe authoritarian I Know better than you just follow my lead leader because those people tend to get yes\nIt is no matter what they say and you know it's a hit in Alice in wonderland if you don't know where you're going then you're headed in the right direction um it's really it uh I can really get companies I'm off on the wrong foot\nWe're speaking with Sue Shellenbarger the wall Street Journal so of course all these terms are extremely general ... you know you're making a general characters characterization but are there differences between a humble woman as a Boston a humble man she held to something different\n[noise] I it it that's a difficult thing to say it varies by workplace um I don't think there are a lot of differences and expectations of male and female bosses in some\nWorkplaces in others it's still true that\nA woman boss wouldn't be suspect if she came across as more than charismatic and authoritarian um I think it just varies it it's true generally that women have tended to be more humble in the past because of their upbringing and their experience in the workplace they face some obstacles that men don't\nAnd again that do humble buses work across all industries\n[noise] good question um increasingly they do is more industries become infused by technology and I just in time management rapid change it's becoming more valuable in all industries\nSue Shellenbarger the wall Street Journal in thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas
