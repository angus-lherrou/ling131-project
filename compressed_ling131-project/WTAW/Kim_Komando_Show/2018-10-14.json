search\nNeed to make money on line quickly because there's so many scams\nWhile there is one scam in particular that I Want to be on the lookout for until you more about that and just a moment but first here's the phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew but been skiing they came commando show man cave hello there Andrew\nKim Eric use in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long if you have to say how many years seven was Seventy no no sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a long time\nWe should probably talk about not being in turn anymore\nYou know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure on 'em and like you scoffed at when I said Seventeen I Know\nCanned food [laughter] teen pretty rough [laughter] God Andrew ... co [noise] so\nEric yes or he wants to be able to in non I'm asleep put photos on the Internet and when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good\n... you know because it sounds like revenge porn or sure yeah it sounds like something shady\nYes but he has good reason he used to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents to be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication from\nAn interesting question yeah that is because it's still so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct and\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for five or wow okay\nAnd this year the father the biological father passed away when I Do um we had some dealers out for people who have contact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could anonymously present them pictures that they can see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to say I want to be able to target who can see them\nI I get that I get that or you know first of all what big hearts\nBut you and your wife must have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nRight now they're seven eight ten and eleven\nWow okay it's a full household\nAnd he in an eleven while okay it's a full household [laughter] it's a full house with four other to the brain so that we have eight\n[laughter] that's awesome that's awesome a couple of thoughts come into mind uh of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there's no identifiable characteristics you know ... and so forth and yeah I Would take out all the all the medical data and the E. X. I. F. data\nAnd you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right sure uh because\nA lot of people don't realize and you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I put down is that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera\nOr just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you out of school photos number one or you can put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call\nIs that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shut her fly okay shutter flying will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it ah say once a week or once a month and so they could start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them going\nTo see it as well [noise] okay uh so\nJust said or to shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again there's going to be some options when you do this that you really looking for your own unique website\nAnd then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of waste that stuff in the back and\nAll right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there're works relieve their works relieves\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps in your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their or works relieved today it's into the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year as a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas\nIs that job scams they're claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here's how the scam works listen up you get a voicemail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour to maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month catfish you're working from home [noise]\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like\nA Amazon cash Amazon cash website ... jobs you name it but here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof cameras gone all your money your dream of\nA telecommuting and earning cash and your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning belts and if you are looking for legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor\nA virtual

you\nThat to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to

review for us\nAnd\nSo and that's that can be on that little cart or that can be on the printed receive that could be part of the email confirmation\nOr the text that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start to you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different\nWays that you can give them an incentive you know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make it better but\n... and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the
