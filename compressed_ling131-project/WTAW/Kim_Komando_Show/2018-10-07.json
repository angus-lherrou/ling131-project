that\nGoogle has tracked about me is that possible or do I need a court order for that we're going to give you that answer again still to come this hour they came commando show but the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again it's a way to join us\nAnd when you're calling again there's Andrew ... and the Kim commando show man cave Kim though there Andrew\nSo Scott in Charleston South Carolina called him and he said I just got back from months in Europe and Russia\nAnd we're worried about Internet Security and ice and Scott you just got back shouldn't have been the hall and they have foreign your when it's\nJust you know it's a little heads up Scott [laughter] next time give us a call before you go and he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves to be secure\nOK so a friend of mine who lives in London in Iraq or you know okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel why fight right [laughter] okay and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light like when\nOkay and it stayed\nConstantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why\nDo you think they were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese told they would not do that at all gosh gotten either what the Russians what are you worried about\n[noise] [laughter] well I Would have loved to add up to you talk to you before we called\nBut that was the only option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one the ... always been ours devices or less ... than a Android or PCs now if you just first confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] the the reason why that people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are\n... that apple keeps hold on everything okay so in order for you to penetrate through the\nIt keeps a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone or if you want him to\nAnd basically take all those security and the trolls and ripped away but if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa device that it is more difficult than they Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] [noise] well what I did do a story on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a fold\nDo us a it's a VPN and but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in a situation like you know [noise] what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank and pay your credit cards and check Facebook in business and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except that obviously to pay ... a it was mainly just to tricky meal\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like uh where where you go like well just going to take the melon\n[noise] it was so much that if there were several types it seem like the deep you prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website it it just like anything getting on the Internet period\nAnd it could do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of the peons where if you look at their coverage maps\nAnd that you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course the the they had the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are trucks traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything [noise] uh so that this way if you need to restore it then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country are going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six month you might be able to feed again but quite possibly a year and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have that access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\n[noise] it's about the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen those in the sun Dr has a rotating code on it even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a coat on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would try to\n... I Would encourage you to see if you could still some of that type of\nA extra layers of protection as well and they sent me for you to just give us call we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip at a safe return but again just spent some time and change all those passwords and listen I have to tell you if you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador ... super excited about that\nAt our commando dot com slash and Basset or you refer your friends to the Kim commando show and they came commando show newsletters and you can earn valuable prizes\nYou can win a dash cam a laptop\nOr a blue to speak or I mean really great prizes you do not have to be a Kim's club member to participate we're talking about commando dot com slash ambassador\nOr in your newsletter scroll down to the bottom you'll have a direct link to Europe particular page really excited about that the right where you are talking about the history of the cell phone now boring coming up here on the ...\nYou know bring your marriage is a little guy\n\nHere's some exciting news as a company simply save is now valued at a billion dollars not only that more than two million homes are not protected with an incredible simply say system\nSimply say if this comprehensive protection for your home with round the clock professional monitoring that would bring the police anytime there's even the slightest hint of a problem and simply say is built for the unexpected\nIt's loaded with safeguards that keep your system working even during the power and why fight outages even if a burglar smashes your keep at the police will still be on their way and the system is so easy to use\nIt's incredibly intuitive it takes only minutes to set up in your home or you're simply safe system now as a list or the came commando show you get free shipping and free returns\nStandards were established world why would you basically opened up the cell phone industry so now it can begin to grow commercially so Nineteen Ninety two you know what happened in Nineteen Ninety two uh\nThe first text message with that and you just read that story [laughter] added ...

union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that a number two is that they were able to potentially pass this check through so what are what are the banks say that you could do as precautionary means right now\nWell the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the the our account number and switch over to another one not the the routing number wasn't anything um but certainly because we wanted to maintain a we'd been there for years and that again they know our habits and that was a kind of a defensive player\nI so I guess the the big thing take take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\nWell sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this caught us at off guard a bit because we were right smack in the camp right smack in the middle of but just sold our house and a lot of the house but we are we're
