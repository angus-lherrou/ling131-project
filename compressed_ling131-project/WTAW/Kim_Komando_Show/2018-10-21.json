eye of the camera and not the actual screen right things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on you okay and\nIn Chicago you have sunny days you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days I've been there like a good so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this\nAnd it's a it is a ring and uh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend for over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portrait that people use that for it's also when you're on when\nYou're using a webcam is that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I look better in a dark restaurant\nNothing not so much K now when you're faces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay\nAnd so you being a

what I Would do is I Would just record\nSay a couple of seconds and then you don't have to worry about just taking a picture so if you've been to record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad

excited frail um the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it makes\nLike I said it makes total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself

had\nTo tip jars okay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\n[noise] one was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android\nOne didn't have anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks trip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids come over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants and a bunch of barbecue\nAnd I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee\nOkay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know door dashes and tore us for that and also overreach because they'll say like pricing search okay and so they add another five dollars\nIf you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may be\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably the it was like a hundred and fifty\nDollars so you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter] which is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\nOkay and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave him\nAn extra four or five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this worked otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that big wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total\nEven on a tip yes okay\nBecause they charge square and the other ones say two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that tone and thinking about this if they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction\nThen you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he ... he never mind I'm Still not tipping well it is hard it is hard and\nYou know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there's no maybe about uh that I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin so here's ten percent I'm just instead of having an African images use the cash that you're expecting me to the gym to like my ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years of epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm uncommitted user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical apps and ego tanks forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner love this friend is my printer choice\nFor a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate buying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway golden no it's colored IQ\nBut the epson ego tank forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG riding the bucks that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge sets now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's yeah do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ink tank and seconds they go take a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now\nEpson dot com slash eco tank can that's easy O.

know what you okay ... you know which you could possibly get and I don't know of arise and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free is\nThat you may be able to get a little what's called a fence do self or your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I can rent a robot the Comcast is that\nIf Comcast is using other ... cells to increase your reception in your bars I don't know if I like that either\nUm so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house\nThat will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest me so I get a stronger signal\nAnd then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap but if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers is that even though like for rising and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technology so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay I'm In there\nHardware on the tower makes sense okay huh I'm now they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make more money\nSo the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with and say you know which frequencies Comcast on a tower and how does that compare a variety so that this is not that\nYou're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different of that one service might be better and I and Comcast since it's a cable company some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee and it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um is basically you're talking on for gee you're talking about one gig abet a per second speed versus on five gee you're talking about multiple database and so\nYou know couple of solutions that you might want to try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close to ... I'm afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage made very right and she was like it could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is at Comcast turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works and\nExplain to them I don't want to sign a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she when I'm getting and you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so getting might have to escalate this little bit up higher\nBut it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation and Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on\n[noise] are you doing on looking or an app\nThat I can secure the sun among to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and rather than go through the insurance on the ... center

that\nSomething I can periodicals down here in the owners are\nUh you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a rule\nOf thumb is when you're sending money to friends be you know you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called the ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the came commando show [noise]\n\nYour memory marriages digital cameras on them\n\nOver

detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie\nYou know that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hub you start thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to this right it is so good ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that that that's awesome audio\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart thing so this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nA little and networks with the smart things next he uh everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely\nYou know on the next year or so so so that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons but once we had the hub what else can we do it
