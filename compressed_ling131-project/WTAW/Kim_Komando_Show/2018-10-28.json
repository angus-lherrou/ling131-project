it's like sure you know all this was going on and you had no idea until somebody told you that this information is being downloaded through the router\nAnd did they say that maybe your computers are being used to house any type of pirated material\nNever heard a ...\nOr a cause that's a lot of data fifty gigs in a day I mean that's huge are so\n... more than once and you feel well yes that's what I was thinking that maybe\nA because what sometimes with the the hackers do is that they find a vulnerable computer and then they house files there and then they tell everybody to go access to file on

tech race were to start with\nA little item from the oh my gosh the newest smartphone\nHow would you like a phone that you could actually fold up and then shoved in your pocket right\nIt's something that several tech makers are racing to release and now it seems at Sam's down to the first one at the gate they're going to be releasing the first two fold double phone that's right\nThey tease the big reveal the device that its developer conference a on a tweet to they'll show the short animation showing two lines unfolding into an arrow anything that are filled with smart phones could be in the future\nNow it looks like the big reveal is going to be happening in San Francisco on November seventh\nNow I haven't seen rumors that the Samsung fold\nPhone is not a thousand dollars not Fifteen hundred dollars in trade if you want the Samsung full double phone [noise] or one thousand eight hundred dollars ... ... I Wonder if it makes phone calls\nAnd while we're on the topic of phones\nWell everyone's going bigger and better well one little company is making one little phone it's a phone about the size of a credit card to think about this to do the full of phone the big one that you put in your pocket what if he would just have a little tiny phone the size of a credit card well if the brand new palm\nWhat if he would just have a little tiny phone the size of a credit card\nWell if the brand new palm many smartphone the variety than exclusive phone is available on November ... second\nThe full retail price is three hundred and fifty bucks tiny tiny Android powered smartphone\nHere's the deal gotta listen this is not meant to be you're going to phone doesn't even have its own phone number instead\nThe palm many smartphone uses numbers shared think with your primary phone so you have your big phone and you have your little phone and they share the same phone number [noise] the whole idea that you can take the palm out with you when you don't want to carry your big handset\nAnd because it's an Android devices back into the dry messages by the way if you have an iPhone so it's like a phone for your phone like a mini me or you put a strap on him for your wrist or you call it a smart watch a phone or your phone I think it's kind of a dumb idea [noise]\nHappening come on Robin how are you going to what's going on with\nThose kids they can stream the video games on a cell connection\n[laughter] Oh thank you very much for taking my question\nYou betcha alright so tell me what's going on\nOkay so we have a a hot spot that's like a jet act and we have unlimited plan [noise] ah we have twenty five gigabytes of data and we used Fifteen in like four hours and then and we will go down to the bottom and it's slow extremely slow\nPace of ... hours wow\nYeah because I have two teenage boys you're updating their [laughter] video game with a X. box and and what not and\nAnd then my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and then I have another one that has an eye pad and likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just\nI'm frustrated so I was wondering if a we boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked at and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work fresh\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um it's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay and so it's amplifying\nThe signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay\nWhen a and it does it by ever find that connection with them in a certain area around you okay I'm a case so so that's not gonna help you um I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nWhat you do what she because you know if you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through fifth you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean we're right then uh there is always satellite and\nYeah we've [noise] try well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about it\nYeah if you don't want specially when if you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or does it work very well it also crawls um have you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company correct because we've called our uh TV company and\nIs that those Bactrim\nYes okay back them and charter and nobody will come down our road and all them since two thousand for\nUm [noise]\nI just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kaye\nIs a a friend of mine recently purchased a home in North of ... there's probably isn't going to be moving to but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise] and so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you have like this stretch of road where there's nothing\nOkay miles around and and she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres okay All right it's in the house is like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there is she has no neighbors right right now she's also a\nDoctor on call [noise]\nAnd so before so she has the house in escrow and she's totally Cosby she freaks out she's like\nOh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet and we I have this openness grow so I told her just\nTo uh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her who who has the line and has set up a point to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOK okay and she pays fifty dollars a month\nShe said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that hurts\nSaid she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and now she was worried about that right [noise]\nBut but still she's able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at them in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I'd\nSee if there were any options in in a if you just Google years that\nCode with point to point that's what it's called or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless and basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight okay so if there are a lot of mount there's a lot of mountains around you\nKnow OK okay\nSo so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work but years ago as I I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there who are the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a fixed point wireless lined put in on the roof\nThat I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay\nFor a while so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless I Would also call wins stream in your area or to see if they have any options for you as well\nYou know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster ah 'cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there\nAnd then I started playing you're now you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs and ah so you know and then and then of course you're going to have to tell the kids that you know there was a time\nNot too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] in the snow with no shoes exactly [laughter] so they're just going to have to go to the library okay we'd been there at all out to eat [laughter] we've tried hat [laughter] I could just\nSee you you're you're you're you're like you know those certainly there's on the street like outside the Starbucks you guys just show up with the truck\nDrop the couch [laughter] dropping table it's like\nThere's a yeah that's Robin and the kids for doing good hey nice to see it I said before actually there's a there's an they're just not a lot of options here a at least you can still laugh about it and the kids will always remember the same when they moved to college there would\nBe like a bottom fight Internet

was his phenomena\nWhere this guy had a rock he got rocks and he put it in a box\nAnd he told you the rock which just rock just rock like a normal rock yes nothing special ... episodes you the rock and the guy made like two million dollars selling rocks St buying a box with a rock and yes it was I'm waiting for the punch line here though there was a total fat okay\nYou know as a matter of fact when I ... and I you've heard me tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CBS his name is Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening and Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a\nFad a fad like the pet rock [laughter] and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it's like a\nPet products or my iPhone is just a pet rock sitting in my pocket speaking of the phone one last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore\nI saw them in Great Britain okay summer no I I've been a long time\nAnd so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just stand there like being in towards like\nHi okay and in plus out laughing and I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there were all these naked women painting like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers and they found a use for the phone booth ... which is also the phone book\nBut it isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast\nForward and when when did the iPhone come out and years ago to send them seven that was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone okay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah how we're all generations video games\nGame boys just how the game boy I say go CD game this generation I don't know anything about that no cars on their parents' phone\nThey don't know anything about a road atlas like a map map yeah now now that that's good right yeah okay\nI've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm going\nTo try now okay America Online now you know I started the computer section that America Online news yeah years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk around the cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there because\nHow they did that behind the scenes\nIs that and I can I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday\n[laughter] that with AOL is that if you gave a desk sometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person use that if that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\nI mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was banking like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL do ski yeah just how are you getting them in people's hands just stand on a corner trucking about people\nYou know like I've been in the science [laughter] no I was I Would put him in like because I had\nThe computer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened is that so you know so I'm like I started the computers they actually got this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten and it's all numbers I've gotten like a check for twenty five grand for that you're not just by people using the disk you hand about it with the disc and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I managed I mean this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us that's a bit different that's a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me [laughter] thanks okay\nAnd so that was when using key word commando instead of going to AOL that I knew we negotiate I didn't go that it would go to commando dot com that's when you watch the website\nBut that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon the company for the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one\nCan you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes thing called the handshaking no ... [laughter] yes\nI mean it was so bad that you know sometimes we go away and and where there'd be no Internet or anything and I like walking around making that sound like you can only do they do that intentionally\nYes\nThey wanted it to sound like you know they wanted people to know that that was connected because previous to that it did not make us out if you want to listen to a fascinating pod cast and then we got to go to a break fast same time that no I that I just uh I I was mesmerized by this past week matter of fact I'm going to write this woman an email\nThe woman and the guy who started Cisco Systems ... they they no longer part of it they got pay they paid them off along the way but now it's just goes worth like two hundred billion dollars how they started Cisco Systems in the seventies\nFascinating story just an amazing story and you know why it's called Cisco don't she went down the woman went down to the business office in San Francisco she tried to register like sixteen different computer names in the seventies and they were all taken\nSo she's standing there on the street and she says I'm In San Francisco she sees the bridge and she says that's a gateway we're building a gateway so that's where Cisco Oh nice came from San Francisco and you still see the gateway bridge\nAs part of the local but anyway it's fascinating podcast about that [laughter] oh\nAll right let's talk about be prepared dot com one of our great sponsors here on a came commando show and this past week Austin, Texas was issued a boil water notice due to some elevated levels of silt\nRead in the prior weeks flooding ... customers were instructed to boil their water for three minutes wow three minutes before ingesting it\nYou know water main break create unsafe water problems and in fact the American society of civil engineers estimates that a water main break happens in the United states every two minutes this is the perfect example of why each person in ...\nAnd I did states every two minutes this is the perfect example of why each person in your home should have a commando kid from be prepared dot com for situations ... like this because\nAmong the items in a kid or thirty four ounces of ultra purified emergency can water and a twenty two ounce water bottle that filters up to sixty gallons of clean water this is great\nYou'll be able to get the water you need without having to boil it\nNow I have a ... kid for each person in my home and you should to I Want you to be prepared for the unexpected you need to their commando kid is a complete survival engineered backpack loaded with just the most innovative tech\nI hand picked this with all the experts folks critical food water gear for one person order now you're going to receive fifty dollars off year commando kid and get a three in one solar charged lanterns for free so you're going to have everything that you need right in his commando kid\nIt over to be prepared dot com slash Kim don't wait until the disaster happens don't wait until somebody says you need to start boiling your water this is what you need right now to be prepared it over to be prepared dot com slash can that be prepared dot com\nSlash can stay right where you are coming up and about wireless charger send the right one to buy here on the came commando show\nWe never miss the kitten commandos sale again why should I listen whenever and wherever\nFor about a dollar a week with Kim clubs do to get Kim Dotcom now ... town\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life\nParents teachers dentists and always a different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't and most of the shoes worn out toothbrushes to boot so let me introduce you to quit\nQuit is electric it's small light and sleek there's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quip\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered just a dentist recommend every three months\nFor just five dollars try quit and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals\nQuit starts to just twenty five dollars that's it does it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill baggage free at G.
