All right and of course cross breed holster and everything that goes with them let's go to a W. R. Hawkins and W. R. let's talk briefly about cross breed because you wrote a great piece\nAbout one of my favorite holster with cross breed and I love when you do this because we get to talk about this stuff off air like hey man do you use the drops wind offshore do you use the slides the snap slide or tell me a little bit about this type of up to protect us\nOr do you use the slides snap slide or tell me a little bit about this type of of soup protect you use is we have these great conversations and everything you write about the holster is everything that I see in response to come back to everybody and I get to send it to care on the crew at cross breed holster you wrote about and tell us what you wrote up and and why and what you found out\nIt was ... it is it's a little different than across free for the listeners you know cross breed is inside the waistband snap slot as outsiders snaps lot has\nIt has a large piece of leather behind it now and then you can get it with horse had\nBut for the most part leather and then it has a cosmetics mold for your gun to fix to that leather and as with the super took the beetle ever dissipates the weight of the gun the presence of the gun it ... it's\nUnbelievably comfortable uh what else I like about it is it holds the gun tight and ah\nI like that so that ... I live and T shirts you know and I can I can with a T shirt with a holster S C I carry the H. E. K. U. S. P. Compaq I carried a Springfield ... the nine sub compact\nAnd I carried a what was the other one's a Beretta or a PX century and that's a fairly you know that got that same size as a glock Nineteen right Carrie ... T shirt concealed because it hold it against your body and hot and I just love the ... and uh\nYou know and it is cross breed so it's quality and I'm just throwing it 'cause that's what I've learned not I didn't learn that cause someone told me I learned it because I use the posters and uh\nIt just it's a great holster and it's also affordable in my opinion compared to other posters of the same genre you can acquire one of those for about forty nine dollars of things right there's a lot it's going to last a lifetime so that's it it's sort of\nCrap I like the high like the way it holds up high too I've got a number of I'm a I'm a big fan of\nOf the uh the uh the drop slide as well depending on what type of gun if you've got a little bit larger done the drops I worked well for me too\nBut the super talk of course we talked about the super took I remember the first time you've tried that to protect you call me the next thing went oh my God it was satellite radio moment words all over the place your reaction was very similar to mine the first time mark the ... the founder and the designer of the original super talking God rest his soul for\nIt's been a hard believes been so long since he passed away already but I remember when mark called me says do me a favor I heard you talking about this on the radio don't give up inside the waistband carry yet try my holster\nAnd boy I'll tell you your reaction was very similar to mine on that of the ... the way it dissipates the weight is worthy of note because I wouldn't have believed it when you looked at it originally I thought this can't possibly be boom I forgot I had a full size clock Seventeen on AWOL\nBut right and with the snap slide you made me think of some though with the ... the can't owned a gun is perjury\nAnd ah but yeah uh with with with the super talk and I think I've said this radio before before I said at the first time I said I should say what I'm going to say that I'm going to ...\nAgain uh I Know of taking a nap twice ... took on and my gun in it and that just 'cause I I literally it it's so comfortable back there I don't think about my gun being on them\nAnd that's the only way I can tell you because when you for me I just don't like it inside of the way Spain carry host or a a unless it's extremely small or whatever and ... but the ... you realize is what the cross breed\nLet's assume protect does everything has a purpose it's not\nIt's not wider than a normal host or because they're sloppy it's not taller than another host or because they're sloppy or didn't plan it out\nIt dissipates the presidents and later that gun and when you put that separate took on you will forget you're carrying a gun and ah you know I don't mean that in a reckless fashion obviously that's the kind of comfort we're talking about\nI found that same comfort with the snap slug\nYou know yeah in the outside the waistband it's it's really true I got to take this remainder\nTo tell the story about this about mark I have to because it's a great story I did a commercial for them I ... a television T shirt [noise] camera peace with them telling the same story but market hurting me talking mark ... the founder of cross breed of the many years ago had heard me talking about how I it'd be simply given up on WB inside the waistband carry\nFor my full size God I just couldn't find anything that works I got a number of great manufacturers and the number of great super high quality ... they just were not working for me and he heard me swear off on that and he heard me say I was lucky I Lived in Georgia\nAnd outside the waistband carrying was not going to be a problem\nAnd he called me and he said wait don't give up let me send you this holster and I want you to try this and what you do me if they want you to get up when you get up in the morning at seven thirty more time you get up I\nWant you to put it on and what you put your gun in it and when she worked for twenty four hours don't take it off and that's exactly what I did I got the whole story on a Saturday I went to work and broadcast it on a Sunday put that thing on seven thirty in the morning\nI wore it all day long broadcasted in it came back and as I Want to do on Sundays after the monster show a W I fell asleep on the couch woke up about seven o'clock the next morning\nForgot I had it on until I got up and went upstairs and take a shower that's how comfortable that host or was but then I told the I've taught that story many many many times in and I know that you you experienced and I thought\nIt's just a cool story to tell I called markets you God thank you he said I Want to participate on your show I said You're welcome to and we've been to cross breed holster studios ever since\nIts just are remarkably design a piece of equipment we've got thirty seconds did you want to close it out real fast\nBut yeah I mean the host or just remarkable but as I say both of them are but yeah it says you can tell nothing nothing on these posters as they are by chance and materials chosen the way they're put together everything or at least ... is a winner and that's the bottom line where you're inside the waistband or outside\nThe either way you go ... or ... it's a winner and\nI'll tell you it regardless to of what gun you carry I've I've got a whole slew of guns in my safe and I have a cross breed forever virtually every single one of them and it doesn't matter whether it's whether it's a small sub compact whether it's a full size Nineteen eleven men\nIt really you got a little bit off the track there but I'm Glad we did was it was a great the great conversation I Hope you check them out cross breed host there's not come\nOr off all you have is a cell phone in a brushing your purse well then I'm going to tell you right now you're at a disadvantage from the get go\nAnd you know it's a great point and it's again it's some theater of the mind here fathers mothers your daughter work at Starbucks you may be working her way through college hoping pay some bills maybe she's working the you know to to buy a new car young maybe you got a young daughter\nThis this what you want your daughter thinking when she goes to a Starbucks I don't want to die this way that's what she's thinking is it going to work at a Starbucks that day she has to think that she's being beaten to the ground\nOh my God I don't want to die this way I'm just going to work what the hell thank God a man had a gun you know if the media told these stories every day the way they should\nAmericans would think a lot different about David how there wouldn't be David hogs and there wouldn't be every town for gun safety is if the media told the story is like you do\nAll right let's let's go to another story that I think is really important that you wrote about all of them are but in particular are you talk a little bit about Wells Fargo you know gun owners are under attack from a lot of different areas\nEspecially in New York with Mary ... Mario Cuomo right ...\nAnd I'm attacking the national Rifle Association and insisting that banks no longer do business with us but Wells Fargo bucks corporate gun control issues forty million dollars in credit to Ruger firearm whoa I thought they shouldn't be doing that\nRight well you know the Wells Fargo I think in April are reported Wells Fargo booked\nA the time then too and they they said look it's all up to a bank to sit us gun policy and uh I think since Sandy Hook attack they've done four hundred thirty one million dollars with the gun industry and bottom line as their ah\nAh believe it was their CEOs who said it you know that what they're doing is they're working with companies that make products that are legal and uh so why not do business with companies that make products that are legal\nAnd you know uh it just it's silly I mean not to me I remember when I was in graduate school I'll be very fast people make fun of it because I like narrative history\nGoes from point a to point B tells the story\nThey said no one teaches narrative history anymore and they all laughed at me in class and I go well good good deal and they go oh you mean like oil if no one else has interested I shouldn't have trouble getting a job you know and this is the same thing for\nWells Fargo here no one else has gone along these groups money so Wells Fargo here as up to that extent these lines of credit lake the interest on it the bank will get rich as they can be also they just like they\nWould get rich off anything that they loan four hundred and thirty one million dollars to and Wells Fargo was a genius in my opinion for\nUh being brave enough to say well look these are legal companies we're we're gonna we're going to use their money to make more money for our bank and I think I think kudos to Wells Fargo for this\nYou know what's fascinating to me too and I bet this comes into play\nOr not but I'm going out to a tombstone Arizona in a week week from tomorrow the name Wells Fargo was forever linked with the image of a six for stage coach thundering across the American west loaded with gold\nThe full history over more than a hundred and sixty years is rich in detail with great events in America's history from the gold rush to the early twentieth century to prosperity depression and war Wells Fargo earned a reputation of trust due to its attention and loyalty it paid to its customers get this and this is really really cool\n[laughter] I'm going to run out of time for someone to have to tell you when we come back from the break but I Am going to tell you\nWhen we come back from the break about Wells Fargo history just one or two quick line that I think might have something to do with the fact that they like doing business with a meeting real American value their right to keep and bear\nArms negatives on stage in\n\n\nMy arms American radio at hand if you were looking for a Leslie for them to check out the days are pulling in compact easy to use and doesn't require lightened most using technology trusted by law or the taser ... can be deployed from Fifteen\nFeet and delivers a thirty second cycle giving users the time they need to find safety and your devices elected Steen teachers they just keep program\nOr a place in rehab charge tasers self defense how confident and protection to live and maintenance I got my TV on I ...
