and might not be an enthusiast\nA lot of lot of folks out there now who just have a gun at home because they want a gun at home and might not be an enthusiast might not know about this incredible cartridge the four sixties up hard hit her man tell us about it how did you come up with it and what where can we get it and where do where do we should it\nWell I'll tell you it's up there there's kind of fun story there about how it happened or realize that out in the country where I'm originally from a sort of last year they care gone all the time of like you I mean this is\nA one time of the great legendary build Jordan I heard some also build you have your gun and he said do I have my pants on well yeah\nSo anyway I'm In Louisiana we lived in a in a rural area and a way out in the woods and I have a cougar come up on Monday\nAnd you know a\nA a a I said you know a cougar you can take a cougar\nWhat are the twenty two magnum if you can get him the whole state of the trick is getting in the whole stale and we're talking a hundred and Seventy five pounds of of teeth and closes spring\nSteel muscle if they'll all be wrestling with a cougar and and unfortunately ... like in in the movies and on on some of these programs of accuracy under stress is not quite itself or as easily as a folk you need what we call stopping power\nAnd I carried a ... magnum revolver for a long time but you know it was hard get in the truck with it it was it just and then we call from the forty four magnum mogul blasts was pretty horrendous well uh I kept thinking if there'd be some way that I could somehow equal\nPay forty four magnum revolver but do it in the soil and relatively lightweight certainly portable Nineteen low level plentiful\nAnd a good friend Jim Clark senior the great postal Smith was mental my great friends and\nAnd I began to talk with him about it and so he gave me some parts in I began to experiment I had some friends of power companies and all and I I hit a ballistic combination that no one knew existed including me\nAnd so uh I wound up with a compensated a barrel from originally from ... guns and we wound up getting a I felt like a ... with the power levels that I wanted I couldn't do it in a regular\nUh forty five ACP case because somebody might put it in a in an own modified forty five ACP gun it's truly a four fifty one ... it's like a forty five Meg them but I called it the four sixty to give it so people would understand it was a different cartridge so we actually\nAre linked in the chamber of slightly sixteenth remains you actually so uh you can you can shoot the forty five\nIn our borough called the number of hits by salt extract or any way you can shoot the forty five an hour for most of the time but you can't shoot a four sixty in a forty five ... thirty eight revolver\nShe with a three fifty seven magnum cartridge you the three fifty seven magnum while she was thirty eight but it won't shoot uh uh the thirty eight won't accept so\nWe're using compose that are common that are easy to come by the inexpensive\nAnd it does get forty four Mac boom performance a revolver performance but it does with much less noise much live recall were running about a thousand pounds of mobile energy motor lady five grind Bullock one about Fifteen hundred and Seventy five feet per second I borrow easily these shoot\nStrict and and plus we we gained a an advantage and accuracy I've always thought that\nThe twist ratio in 'em and with little technical here we won't last long the twist right was a little bit too slow and realize the twist right in a forty five ACP borough lights from Nineteen low level will technologies come alone will of the manufacturers have stayed with that twist right\nWhen you give 'em velocity\nIt increases stabilization of bullets and we have we got guns shooting on a two inch groups that a hundred yards five shot groups and that's not terribly unusual\nSo it would it's easy to carry and we've we've got some law enforcement carrying because a lot of officers out there by themselves and let me tell you what on patrol sheriff's deputies and when you've got are caught one round of our coffers equal to about\nThree forty five base he pays four to five nine millimeters and striking power and control and that was done so well we've been more\nAn enthusiast cultures were becoming more
