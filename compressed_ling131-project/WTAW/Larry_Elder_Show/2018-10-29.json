the segments were just flying bicycle which make sure you buckle in okay going to be an awful lot\nAn awful lot of content being covered we're gonna move very quickly to that I Want to read a comment first let me start with this kind of as I opened up the previous hour two she missed it I'll start with this I did a national radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not that I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens it kind of\nReach out to me that have been very friendly to him over the number of years so I certainly don't mind doing I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just their elites McGinnis at the top\nThat doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're going to get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but uh the article after my appearance on the show is titled or maybe just brush with I don't know I'll be should be leading a leading Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter a seed and a lot of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get as you and good luck on your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks wouldn't help the situation has quoting me a background check looks up\nWouldn't help the situation as quoting me a background check looks up the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America who had our past\nBackground checks quoting me again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun he can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work\nBecause they can't be banned they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that want this to stop you claim\nHowever at this point Kevin seemed to lose his patients referring to gun supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U. S. Kevin responded that the fifth of Americans with dunes are intimidating the fall is that do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark all I don't want your thoughts and prayers anymore they hung up on me\nThey didn't say that and then he hung up on the end of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back which is proof positive that you won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big boys\nSo the video is on there if you want to go see it just Google LDC\nAh Kevin McGuire clashes with us gun rights supporter and take a look at it I put it out on my Twitter page if you want to see it at a A R mark at a A R mark what's funnier than anything is to come down below\nBoom box to the ultimate quicken accessible handguns safe ideal for securing your firearm will not carrying on your person our cutting edge technology and innovative safety features provide peace of mind will store you're going to the next game is going to do or anywhere you might need to access with a simple swipe ...\nChristopher ... for the wave of an hour of ID card above\nThe gun bucks for ... seconds our modern design a sleek lines not only make it a great addition do any space but it's the perfect reason to bring your everyday carry guns out from ... in the clubs in the basement safe\nAsking yourself semi concealed carry weapons ... the answer is yes it was to go to luxury it's most full size ... which room to swear for extra magazines to believe and other items you Gary for protection\nTo go much was designed to be you're going to go to a friend who's absolutely the best alternative for fast and reliable and gun storage visitors for gun bucks dumped them for more information than to buy today [noise]\n[noise]\nMy as my Gallagher you're listening to armed American radio monster broadcast now backing mark ... by the end of the line\nLast day Wednesday ten thirty one how'd you like to get the range with a brand new gun you'd better hurry up USCC a wants that to happen for you they want to get your free gun this is your absolute last chance to win or giving away a different got every single day but it all ends Wednesday so you're almost out of time you've got to hurry on this one just text arm\nTo the number eight seven to two two and get entered right now and it's not just one done you could get up to twenty four chances to win that gun each day could be twenty four cameras ... could be whatever could be a are Fifteen ooh scary I Know\nBut they're all gone Wednesday oh you have to do is text armed ARM eighty eight seven to two two and reviewer which gun you can take home today but remember there's not a lot of time the gun of the day always disappears at midnight\nAnd it all ends Wednesday\nDon't miss out the clocks ticking what it does is flips now I got an email I Want to read real quick from someone about that and he says I'm\nSmart sometimes things we say make a different tone of your sponsors hasn't offered that resets at midnight consider saying it reload midnight is the word that ties directly to the theme of your show take care have a great show [laughter] you know who the dual in Atlanta Georgia thank you for that it does reload I Love it\nAnd I can't call it my own idea because I just credited you with it so thank you for that if you want to email me market armed American radio dot O. R. G. Love to read your emails All right let's go back to a W. R. Hawkins a W. R. Hawkins\n[noise] I I got to go back to Chris Murphy for just a second\nOkay\nBecause here's what Trump said and you pointed in there [noise] you pointed out in your piece if they had protection inside the result would have been far better this was a dispute the will always exist I suspect but\nIf they had protection inside the synagogue maybe it could have been a very different situation\nOkay what's what's wrong with that what it Chris Murphy take exception to when that statement come again keeping in mind listener that he is a man that is protected by guns everywhere he goes in DC what what's up\nWith what he said is he goes Trump's position is no uh to count\nPosition is you know uh to counter dangerous people with on the police that are opposites she used to just be sure dangerous people never get guns well that's fair tail\nSo that's a fairy tale he goes on to say Trump's position works in the movies opposition works in real life that's all I see\nIt in real life wouldn't it\nIn real life it would work Sunday right Saturday because this guy has numerous background checks past one is you know just to get care permit a and so you know we get a guy who's been who didn't it\nAnd it's to your point that you were actually making when you started your show a background check looks backwards if there is no criminal history been a person who plans the most evil date in the world can walk into a gun store would smile and buy a gun no problem\nBecause there's no criminal history to be found in the background check and uh so Murphy doesn't understand his background checks don't work in real life they work in the movies gun free zones don't work in real life they work in the movies having a large congregation of elderly\nCongregants who are defenseless setting together on a Saturday morning that doesn't work in real life that works in the movies you got to have someone there with a gun who can take out a bad guy comes again Chris Murphy is a lunatic\nChris move Chris Murphy is also a liar he knows better he's also a hypocrite because he is protected by guns at the Capitol he understand that he knows that\nHe's just intellectually dishonest as the rest of the socialist party is in today's day and age who speaks particularly on this topic for they know not what they say now interestingly and I don't I'm not trying to catch off guard has has nothing to do with what you wrote a over the past week or today by any stretch but I heard the nine one one calls coming in or I or I heard the police chatter\nThe radio chatter when one of the officers were responding saying there's automatic weapons fire\nAnd that went out over to call you know to the rest of the officers ten thirty eight automatic weapons fire a was their automatic weapons fire there am I missing something\nAmiss you couldn't even at a A R Fifteen and then what I understand they are Fifteen a couple of blocks that even at three o'clock so I'm not sure but yeah you're dealing with semi automatic found out about\nThis happens all the time then in ... and with that officer probably wasn't on purpose but with a gun control the Louis you know Hillary Clinton which you aren't that you'll remember Hillary Clinton used to say that one of the reasons\nYou need ... votes her will stop people from coming to school with automatic weapons fire at my mind not in my mind I'd want to make an oil up to it actually I had\nNever happened so you know but\nSee they want to use just just like Murphy talking about semi automatic rifles they want to use the phrase all the cheetah Sam ... scare the few people who they can scare with their language\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh this is where we are in society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't come home and do the guy you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so but you know I I catch myself to you\nKnow it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out here the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at W. R. if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out\nWithout turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know let's let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just to sell it in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very oh he's a very dishonest man is what he is but we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason\nBecause doesn't that go that headline alone says it all of you are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand that evil exist evil chooses the time and place to become evil\nNot us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true\nYou know there's there's something I'm trying to call trying to turn as hard as\nI think what I write I I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people and I and there's a corner I'm trying to turn where I can somehow get people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be posting on uh it's very simple\nGun control is not a viable substitute for freedom and if you think it is then he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a Cape twenty eight team but he didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen I keep going but a gun control is not a valid substitute for freedom because gun control pre suppose is that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes won't go away it does not work that way what happens is when you limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nOr had I've been a member of the congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the defenseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't do it every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying this is a good substitute for freedom folks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works and that's why a framer went out of their way to hit the second ...\nWell said I'm not even gonna stop that is the excavation point of that a perfect place to take a break you\nSay this on another note that when it comes to arming oh my God what Trump wants to armed guards who we are guards in banks we armed guards in government buildings what the hell is the problem with defending\nWhere we gather that are targeting spy evil\nPast his background checks so ask yourself this question Florida\nWhat the hell is Bill Nelson talking about\nAnd if you get a chance to ask him yourself and ask him what to ask him to tell you what gun control will work ... cat he'll do what Kevin McGuire did in Great Britain he will pack up his toys and leave the sandbox because he can't play with the adult\nA W are sorry I had to go off on that when I saw that and I passed it on my monitor it let me get that off my mother so I don't go into an remark\nAbout All right we also now this doesn't surprise me either California Democrats will use and New York Democrats will use anything they\nCan a W. R. Hawkins won't they to push more gun control in their States isn't that true\nRight that's true how many California Democrats running for office right now are using the Pittsburgh shooting push more gun control and if I'm In California listening to the show\nHere's what you got to think about these people are running for office they're not in office is ill campaign like this for gun control what do you think they're going to do once they're you know you don't need that you're that California is already in the time it's already over the edge on gun control it's ridiculous\nAnd if if there's somebody who thinks one more gun laws gonna matter I mean they're a they're not bright or be there an audio ... which means they're immune to facts like this type of the gender and I think by and large that's ... that's the case with gun control or\nWhat you know you you asked if you actually you pointed out in a statement and I ask a question\nAnd that is in your piece about Democrat Bill Nelson on this very topic I felt that was interesting when I saw that headline and I saw him on the television I just decided to snap on it for a moment but here's what you point out in your opening statement your your piece is titled Democrat Bill Nelson wants to implement gun controls already in place California as a W are just pointed out you can't\nDo any more Cali you just can't you just simply can't\nBill Nelson wants to implement gun control already in place that's the key and here's what I W are says to open up the open up the column\nBill Nelson Democrat of course ... in Florida wants to implement gun controls that are all ready in place and are almost always the means by which mass public attackers get their guns what do you mean by that\nNow I mean if you go back to go back far will but I'd say go back to Columbine a or a if you want to stay in the twenty first century just stay in the twenty first century I Can't think of a high profile public attack or the attacker\nAcquires guns in some way other than background checks\nLiterally the the two exceptions the two exceptions or the ah mall\nShoot mall shooting in Washington state and Newtown and their ... because we both those cases the individual Stoller guns\nAnd murder I wanted to take a take hold of them to I Want to make that very clear that out but out of that [noise] people\nPeople who shoot up places they go pass background checked get their guns and so these these these checks the worst is the only thing they accomplish is what the Democrats\nAnd that is they make the process of buying a gun just a little more bird some and it does cause some law abiding citizens just not to bother because they don't want to go see if that's what the Democrats really want they want to slow down to\nBuying a firearms they don't want them in anyone's hands when they say they're just to get criminals owning them they're not telling the truth they don't want anyone to have a gun\nYou better than you better believe that you better believe that they also point a lot of anger at hunters\nAnd hunters who face death threats for shooting animals legally on hunch will go there to cover it all back
