it's just too darn long and I thank you so much for being here it's a pleasure to be sitting face to face with you always a pleasure to be with you mark your long history you have a long story around\nI'm second generation of gun rights activists advocate of\nAnd to my father was Neal knocks he was a gun writer and then was one of the moving forces behind the Cincinnati revolt in Nineteen Seventy so about the national Rifle Association listeners just for your information right that that\nTurned the national Rifle Association into a lobbying juggernaut um then he\nFounded the firearms coalition which I now run\n'em and eventually dad was elected on to the board of directors of the n._r._a. and became the vice president a man who was in line to be the president the following year but he worried some people and so they recruited\n... he scares some people you didn't worry him your dad scared some people do it in\nCharles ... he scares some people you didn't worry I'm your dad scared some people do not\nRight they they went out and they recruited Charlton Heston specifically to run against dad so that they could bumped him out of the chairs\nAnd keep him from becoming the president of the n._r._a. that's pretty hardcore constantly when that's how important your father was that they actually did that with ... and the what the soil yeah we have more time for it and honestly [noise]\nBut now uh I uh I dad died in two thousand and five I'm I was helping him for the last two years of his life keeping the organization running and\nAnd helping with the day to day writing I have a regular articles on ah ah ... dot com and in firearms news magazine\nAnd ah the website and all of that\nFirearms coalition dot org\nYou said firearms coalition dot org correct that's right firearms coalition dot org\nWe've had some issues we actually had somebody who claims to be a terrorist group hacked our website a few years ago\nAnd we never quite recovered from that my IT guy is a guy named Chris knocks a any relation yeah okay just checking\nMy my brother and uh he uh he's cheap but he's not really great so [laughter] but anyway we've we've revamp the website and it's looking really good\nBut for the last year\nI've been really focused on election politics rather than gun politics and [noise] I've I've kind of let the firearms coalition I'm\nSort of slide a little bit um and I apologize to any of our readers and and followers for that\nBut the election this year is so important and I am working full time to get good pro writes\nA candidate's elected to office this year\nBut let let me stop you because you've moved into election politics let's let's go there briefly absolutely I have spoken so far to some great heavy hitters today Alan Gottlieb Alan Cohen and others are\nIn the election is dominating of course we're now you're talking about midterms national you're also talking about state you're talking about Arizona centric fill me on because this is a vital places as ground zero right now\nWell I moved the coalition back to Arizona I'm about six years ago and when I did I started getting much more involved in local Arizona politics and uh I actually have teamed up with a local a campaign consultant\nWho work strictly with conservative candidates\nAnd um it turns out that concert and the candidates are also pro writes candidates and so I have no\nUh problems are working with these campaigns and and supporting these guys in primarily in local politics we had a couple of congressional candidates unfortunately our candidates didn't ah get through the primary\nUm so now I'm focused on making sure that the Arizona house is as pro\nRights as it can possibly buy it and and how close are we in your estimation to that happening because an outlet to segue ... depending on your answer I'm gonna do it anyway but I Want to segue over to the federal election as well so where are we where are we here locally now\nHere in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that to that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut ah as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council raised by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking\nTo no question or no let's use the state and how you feel comfortable about the state I'm pretty comfortable\nAbout the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe that the governor is going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's ... better than the alternative\nYou know if you would nobody was a big fan of a lot of people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump loved it and called the election and the night of the election on on my radio program I should go to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes in the in the morning\nThree hundred ... I still have people that I'm proud of the asking me to pick their lottery numbers for him so All right let's go now let me segue to the to the federal election I've I've talked with my previous guests over the last hour an hour and a half year\nIn the Arizona is in a strange place very when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one\nPoint race right now today as we sit here at the at the easy CDL meeting in meeting the one who would've ever found that in bright red gun toting gun loving history of the guns state Arizona\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate um has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it uh although\nA lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a\nDemocrat socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected to office\nShe's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate right\nAnd he wanted to spend enough money to get elected in ... when it can you stay here with me for one more second sure you've our good because that we run out of time is just a short segment of the program of the hour what I Want to do is keep your carry on this conversation about the elections your neck deep and there's\nA lot of listeners are very very concerned about we're seeing coming up and coming up in the midterms we want to get your perspective\nNot just your own Arizona but around the country as well\nPlug in individual as a state built on the gun I think of the west I think a custard butt kicked [laughter] okay by a bunch of bunch of guys that could shoot better with Winchester model Ninety four is okay the but the fact of the matter is for eighty floors wherever they were but the fact of the matter is\nWhy do we have to worry about that out here we shouldn't even be having this conversation here in the great state of Arizona Jeff just concerns me and there's a couple of reasons\nWhy we have this problem and one of them one of the biggest is that the Republican Party here in Arizona is rather torn it's dysfunctional we've got\nRight wing radicals we've got\nRight wing not so crazy ... and then we've got moderate me she ... she John McCain Republicans and we're always fighting with each other\nBecause we're used to fighting with each other within the party and the party can't get its act together and um that means that we can't unify behind a good candidate and stick with it\nThat there's a big wing of the Republican Party in Arizona that thinks that the base isn't enough\nAnd they they they want to run for the middle in order to win and they hold up John McCain Jon Kyl Jeff Flake as examples of seed that's what the Arizona people want\nWhat I'm hearing from you right now I'm picturing in my mind radio to me is the editor of the mind and I I'm just trained in doing that when I'm listening to you I'm visualizing a puzzle\nOkay and I'm seeing three or four pieces in the state of Arizona in Arizona put together in three or four pieces based on what I'm hearing from you that it has it seems like Arizona\nIs now\nSearching for a new identity\nBased on that base that you're you're talking about several different bases here right or John McCain voter would never vote for a mic Sally\n... voter would never vote for a cinema I I'm seeing three or four different alone McCain voter would vote for ... and a half to but but a a um [noise]\nBut they're not out in ... I'm a graph a Goldwater voter back in the day would never vote for either of them McCain well this is the here's what I'm Talking about [noise]\nI'm very concerned about what\nI'm seeing in this day and I'm going to be honest it upsets me it really does because this is\nThis just at Arizona to me it's a free state in the country it is to me it's why I live here okay and I don't like what I'm seeing here and we had our core when talking about\nBringing in California is bringing in California values that there is demographic change happening here which is what's happening in Montana as well it's happening in Montana as well it's also happening in will start to see it in Idaho what's been happening in Colorado for a long time\nAnd what amazes me is you get these goofy left his moves that leave what they don't like to go somewhere they can bring their goofy leftist ... Washington state has crushed Washington state to the point that as the tip of the spear there what happens on sixteen thirty nine excuse me\nIs going to determine what happens in this state and Florida next is too big ground zero say Florida is in trouble to\nFlorida in big trouble yup All right you've got a governor that has signed who signed a pro gun Governor Scott was for many years signed a gun control package down there they're never going to move any pro gun legislation and upstate forward now because you've got to Republicans in southeast\nA cat in southeast that are actually
