and the Andrew Nelson here from the city of Brian how are you today I'm doing great thank you for having me let's uh let's go back to last week last weekend Texas reds finished up we had rain 'cause you know you do the family camp out or you do Texas resin we always get rain but anyhow\nAh your thoughts on that well I enjoyed the rain and actually I think it made it a wonderful event because ah it dropped the temperatures down and uh you know it's not like it rained twenty four hours a day or rain in the morning a lot of people were watching the Texas A M a beat a Arkansas\nAnd by the time that was done that came out in a had a great time I know I did\nYou have a good concert on friday night that something a little different that you had your headliner on friday not as opposed on Saturday\nYeah city of Brian worked with a downtown Brian association made some changes to that and I think it worked out really well I mean uh Winona was amazing ah think it was the largest everyone I talked to said it was the largest crowd amongst many large crowds over the past year so I Want to thank everyone who\nContributed make Texas reds are a great a success the downtown Brian association Sandy first and her team\nAs well as all virtually every department in the city of Brian contributed to that weekend from you know the solid waste guys that you would normally see to people it'd be too and infrastructure and even the IT guys who you know you don't know what they're doing but everybody a within the community really made that a great event\n[noise] here's you look at the city of Brian to the development this going on for she's got the super park site you've got downtown Brian and also the midtown areas were calling in the area that runs adjacent to College Station story we're running today has to do with more than ... talking about uh that development and what the consultants plan is kinda year over of you and your thoughts on that\nWell there's a density between Texas saying them and the um the midtown park\nOr that area and needs to be looked at so that we can maximize ah the usability the desire ability that area for the city of Brian we're going to be putting in a ton of money into that park it's not something you do for ten years it's a hundred year decision and we want to make sure that\nAh when we do those things we're thinking about the surrounding area so I think it's money well spent I think we'll get an enormous return on that investment and I ... I wouldn't feel comfortable spending money on the park like we're going to do without making sure the rapidly optimizing things for the city\nNot if I'm mistaken tell me but I thought last week we were going to get something from the consulted on what the first look at what was going to be going on or at the super park am I wrong that that was going to happen I I think we talked about the fall you\nYou may be right I I doubt Iran you normally on top of your facts are Scott but I I can tell you we're still along the same time line I think we're going to be getting an update and workshop uh this coming a this coming week in the October council meeting for the city of Brian\nAnd there'll be given is their their first conceptual ideas of what they think are the park should look like I'm very excited wins the public going to see pictures I guess it'd be the question there hopefully will be a few pictures are at that at that time I mean we're going to go from concept to detailed design where were you you'd do you draw the designs and you really get into the pictures that\nThat are all that will actually be\nSo ah you know that these will be in concept but it will help us to understand what's the project what's the scope of the project are we are we not going to have this ... in the park\nAnd so you know what what that specific this is going to look like may evolve but you know if you're talking about a baseball field do you have an idea of what a baseball field is even if you don't know all the details but ah to get the project done it's going to be an important to actually nail down every detail and that will happen a between the fall and spring\nAs the elected leader of this city you have to know the no matter what is rolled out they're going to be some people are going to be very unhappy with it so how do you address that moving full\nWell you just try to surf people as best you can I wake up you know I I wake up every morning and say my prayers and and ask God to give me a chance to serve the city as best I can this community the best I can I listen uh as much as I can and then make the best the best decisions I can make and let the chips fall where they fall\nUm it's just like a business you have company making people you have naysayers uh but the vast majority of people\nWhether their company making or nay so they usually will listen and they'll talk to other people they respect in and generally a you know they're reasonable people and I think that's what we need to be the part can't be all things to all people but we've had tremendous engagement of the community leaders people who do\nAthletics and the community I mean I think we've done this the right way\nAnd while it may not have every little thing that I Want or you want or are you know I think it's going to really serve the community well for um for the next century\nUh Andrew Nelson here this morning believe it or not I think the most contentious situation ever felt against the city College Station is when they decided they wanted to add a smoking ordinance now granted there was a long time ago and it was a different world but now Brian is decided that you want to expand your ordinance when it comes to smoking vaping your thoughts on that\nWell I think a city council has been engaged by um people who care a lot about the health consequences of smoking comedian they've asked us to look into it and I think uh we haven't made a decision to adopt a smoking ordinance the same as college stations\nOr we're um we're going to be presented by staff with recommendations including showing the differences\nUm I for one am extremely sympathetic to the goals the health goals\nOf a you know daily smoke that the effects of daily smoking um but I also believe in freedom I Believe that big gulp sir bad if you have too many of 'em and I don't think that it's just you know good idea to be banning them in New York City like like the mayor\nAnd over again I don't know all the details with that but you know you hear about smoking you know\nDrinking too much tea is not good for you that you know obesity\nIs a tremendous health risk for young people most smoking things that happened or almost all of those issues are happening you know your average age of death is in the seventies for smokers is tremendous I mean I have family members that have suffered from from that I don't wish that on anyone I'm very sympathetic to the goals of it but I'm just not so sure\nUh banning private companies from all smoking ability to do smoking or in private businesses is um I I guess I'll be a skeptic because I've you know I'd I'd love to see smoking eliminated at at least a non\nOccasional smoking you know cigar smoking once in a while I I think people can do that but uh you know I'll have an open mind is I Try to do all the time but but I have a libertarian streak in me and I believe in freedom so um that's a that's kind of where I'll start that conversation\nFounded today or the United states and China not getting along and then the on the international level but it seems to be working out okay here I bio yesterday\nAn announcement a of a partnership with the Chinese company to ah grow things here that will be able to be used in a very specific cancer research on a cell you were at the tour where we used us using tobacco

makes consumer access more contingent on like a purchase at a bookstore a digital media transaction is continuous linking buyer and seller and giving the seller a post transaction power impossible in physical markets why is that important\nSo I I think this is important for a and a number of reasons ... leads to these scenarios that we were talking about earlier where the settler of good\nAs the ability not only to reclaim a or recall the good but they also have some ability to control how and when and under what circumstances you make use of that product after the sale\nThat's just not something that you could do mhm or the tangible world like you or your local bookstore put aside the publisher your local bookstore can't tell you what country you're allowed to read a book and\nThey can't tell you um you know how many times you get to read it they can't tell you who you get to lend that book too and they certainly can't keep records of all of those interactions and the digital world allows for\nRecords of all of those interactions\nAnd the digital world allows for\nThat that form of\nControl and importantly it's not limited just to digital media or we have all these smart devices are in our homes on our bodies\nUm you know we've got our voice assistance and hour fitness trackers and you know even our home appliances cars\nThey all have software they all have network connections and all the sort of uh problems and as I've been describing are going to play out in that space as well mhm\nWhere device makers are not only going to be able to track your behavior but they're also going to be able to limit the ways in which you can use the products\nThat you think uh we have\nPurchased so so let me let me interrupt here in and just ask you this I see when I go to iTunes I see a movie I Wanna watch it says rent or own I'm not owning it I'm just renting it in a different way isn't this false advertising\nI so I think there is a really good case to be made here that companies like Amazon and apple they use language like oh and by words that have real meaning for people in their everyday lives are missed stating that the nature of those transactions so\nUh my coauthor Chris let's now go and I wrote a paper a few years ago a couple of years ago now I'm ... what we buy when we buy now that did a survey of about Fifteen hundred consumers\nTo figure out what people think this language rule and it turns out that a significant\nPercentage of consumers\nIncorrectly believe\nThat they do have true ownership rights they get to keep the goods they can lend to them they can give them away and we think that there is an opportunity here to\nCorrect this misinformation in the marketplace but think about the company that we're talking about you know apple and Amazon are to the biggest corporations that the world has ever seen and getting them to\nA\nConvincing them to not going to have in a in a more clear and fair way as it is a real challenge\nClass action lawsuit\n[noise] so I think there is a possibility for\nClass action litigation ... they're a bunch of a legal or impractical hurdles to making that happen I think it's something worth pursuing I think the Federal Trade commission has a role to play here this is a squarely within their um\n[noise] uh within their areas of expertise and obligation to police market and make sure that consumers have accurate information\n... go ahead yeah I I just wouldn't go ahead\n... the the way the market works depends on consumers below four people can't make rational choices people can't decide where to spend their money if they're being misled about the products that they're getting so I think it's crucial for for the functioning of the market or to have that information be correct\nHave you done any look into what a society with out real ownership I mean we're down to the you know renting closed and everything else uh and that's only going to get stronger as as as we move forward\nHave you looked into what that means for a capitalist society and for America in particular\nThat has always been about ownership\nSilver my biggest concern here is the way this change is kind of our conception of ourselves in the way we think about ourselves as individuals in a society\nOkay so stop there for a second if I can hold you for just a couple more minutes after the break I'd like you to finish that thought\nBecause I think this is important in the world is being redesigned\nAnd it's being redesigned without any of us really understanding it and we should go in open mind in\nThat didn't come from giant ... deeds apartments they came from individuals messing around with things down in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities\nBut even even more broadly to add on if we're just courage and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world you know I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nUh in our population in our country and you know not not ... to July to the level here but for democracy to function people half the steel and they have to be a change\nTo function people half the steel and they have to be in charge of a lot she asked to be invested in making informed decisions\nAnd ... that that ... you know this this lack of control over the every\nDay this is my play too much broader set of problems when it comes to people feeling like active participant in society democracy\nI couldn't agree with you um I couldn't agree with you more um I\nI just don't think this is the way society is thinking anymore everything is about the collective and very little is about the individual and you know I think you understood you are under state of the case of tinkers I mean if you look at the inventions in America that a lot of them a lot of our progress came from\nWhat used to be called tankers\nPeople who just did things in their own garage in and uh\nAnd now with her so the government or these corporations everyone is being told that's the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's ... I mean that that that you know in in decades that's what created China in many ways that's what\nThey don't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that um spirit of invention that America has always been known for\nSo I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual creators\nAnd we should we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to experiment um to innovate and ultimately it to to share a that progress a with a with the rest of the country and the rest of the world I worry\nThat we're moving in that direction where um people aren't able to build those skill sets because they live in the world of sort of a lock down digital life\nSo let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go I Know you've spent twice the amount of time here that you you probably planned on 'em but let me ask you one more question I Am really concerned about copyrights patents trademarks we seem to be entering a world where\nPeople don't take somebody's intellectual property seriously on the on the other side of this um they just feel that too well I can download it I can just take it a an itch and we shouldn't have intellectual property rights\nThat is frightening because again that was the second piece of the American experiment was you have a right to that intellectual property for a period of time so you can make money on it which encourages other people to come up with their own ideas\n\nDo you see this why do you see this fading in his trouble on the horizon as well\nSo I I write in teach about intellectual property and it's something that they are they take very seriously and one of the things that I always try to communicate to my students is that intellectual property system functions best when there is a\nBalance between the interest of the public and the interests of creators and the history of intellectual property copyright in particular is it is a history of a struggle\nTo find that in in ... that appropriate about 'em\nAnd I think we're we're going through and have been going through kind of since the last for adoption of the Internet a period where we're struggling with how to answer some of those questions are there are certainly areas in which\nUm copyright holders have legitimate concerns about air work's been exploited without\nCompensation and on the other hand we live in a culture in which um\nCopyrighted works a sort of um increasingly ... in a distributed with within these environments like apple and Amazon for example where consumers can't do the things that they think\nThey're entitled or should be ranked Jewish so I think that part of the solution here is providing consumers a strong incentive to pay for these works on that one of the things that streaming services I shouldn't have gotten writes\nA which is that they offer a really attractive deal to consumers so people learn that if they're going to access the world's libraries is it they have to pay for the privilege or not you're not how that money gets distributed\nAnd what the price point is I think is is one of the sticking points so it it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice to um\nYou know a couple of minutes to actually All right Aaron thank you so much I appreciate it and I appreciate a euro thoughtfulness a on this uh and

do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying\nTo the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with this um you know there was old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council you give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing we can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have that I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the all market this just controlling the news flow in the United\nStates is in the end this is in the and Peter controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first controls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it if we don't have them\n... contained in some way or another when they get to a guy we're toast yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just Google the company a lot of people don't realize is I didn't realize this\nIf you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo you're using Google\nThe point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others Google is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple to be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nConcerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and the platform ing and erasing voices right because Google thinks that's you know it's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide K [laughter]\nThey had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the\nLeaves system the picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yeah study of twenty two million yeah twenty two million amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this is with out AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nThat's right and and Google or is that the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies\nReal quick though on Gmail was very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes I used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you've ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin ... you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure\nThis is writing a draft but that's nuts\nThat's just me being on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it might not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct if scanned by Google so Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend whatever Google knows more about you than they do\nAnd they are very aggressively going to retain that information\nBut they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy if manipulation because they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission wants to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the ... documentary as the creepy line or ... let me push back in a couple of sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome it's all of the products\nThat they make are better than everybody else's product at a similar ... and it it would eat ... incredibly inconvenience me to give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's James doesn't\nKnow [laughter]\nMore easier because I mean yes they're everywhere they're doing really good job yeah ... uh when it comes to designing an easy to use product right how do you\nBreak away that's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google\nAnd it's not really that I don't know I think that's a a a road that people will go down\nThat you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is\nWe should be talking to the people in ... no no no we should be sending people who understand this right to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech in Washington\nBecause they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior right it's to the point we must corral Google and break them up or corral them in some way\nNot with just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but not with just little simple laws of what we're going to cut because they'll go around that\nThat fire right okay let me have one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we see we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you have a bridge that guy\nNo I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem\nInto this space the way that technology is moving how Google exerted some market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search I it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interviewed a vice president of Yelp\nOr in in our uh in or a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start you all today is it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago\nTo where they can exist so we have a situation where they're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related\nTo its political alliance in Washington may pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe\nAnd to do things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now Europe publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nYes and that's a hugely important point because when they first wanted or set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you are a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they say we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring so they're acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burdens that they do so it's a competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the ... you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google laughter editing I Know that they are frightened the wouldn't one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\n[noise] Ah yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have\nUm I think by breaking them up into pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different but also bad [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this um because otherwise they're going to continue to read certain market dominance ...\nThe other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility oh no no\nNo [laughter] I don't know what the chilies are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] we don't really have we have an open energy yeah oh that's all we have five different company as in yeah we don't pay anything yeah like the\nNotion of making Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utility now means you've got that government controlling search no ... no interest in that whatsoever\nAnd what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when ... correct elected in two thousand eight\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or is Adam Silicon Valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days with you um I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard pass on that\nYou're aware [laughter] nobody flowers [laughter]\nFeeders wiser he is the president of government accountability Institute the documentary is called the creepy line how do you see it\nUh is going to be available shortly on Amazon I tunes there's a trailer on the Web page and we love to get feedback from\nThen it will be it will be on a YouTube\nI [laughter] I think is so much\nAs I write a\nSour sponsor this F. our his life locked [laughter]\nYou know as we look at as we look at technology and uh how people are into everything life lock here let me give you this on Facebook\nApproximately fifty million accounts were accidentally exposed\nWhoops somebody went in and took fifty million a cow names and all of the information\nBut I Do know is that even
