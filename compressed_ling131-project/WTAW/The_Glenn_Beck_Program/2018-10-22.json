Want to start with his with his book and the thing that everybody is talking about\nThem why we hate each other and how to heal Ben Sasse a welcome to the program senator from Nebraska how are you sir\nI'm doing well Nebraska's got a winning streak going again so we're up in the heartland\nI'm Ben I Want to talk to you and I I I Want to ask you the questions basically that everyone asks me because we are ... on on some things in the same pocket a and I'm\nI just want to hear your response to this um ... you know some some line of questioning that usually comes my way\nWe have a situation to where people have felt they have tried to do the right thing\nThey have tried to do the Tea Party and they were accused of being racist and they were accused of being violent which they weren't meanwhile the press and politicians excused people like ... and it's getting worse and worse no we're not anti capitalist we're not anti American\nAnd then Hillary Clinton says one of the reason she lost was because she was for capitalism you have Cortez coming out and Bernie Sanders stating\nWith a D I say that they are danced capitalism you have and to taking over the streets you have Republicans being shot and the uh on the ball field the press is still ignoring all of this blaming everything on the right\nThen Kavanaugh they're willing to take all the way he to yuppies the gang rapist and destroy people\nWhen is enough enough\n[noise] well so first of all the way we consume politics is a mess and lots of our political discussion itself is a mess but I think it's really important to distinguish between two dimensions one dimension\nIs a continuum from right to left at on those issues I'm as conservative as the cop on on anybody score card on the second or third most conservative senator uh in the United states at it\nBut the second dimension is about the\nSort of senator or in the United States Senate\nUm but the second dimension is about the intensification of politics and how centrally should politics sit in your world view and they're on the big skeptic because I'm a traditional American or of the idea that politics can be near the center of your world view and you end up very happy\nSo I think there's a lot of data now that shows more and more Americans are actually tuning out politics altogether but the people who are involved in politics some of the national media\nSort of purporting to cover it ah\nSome of the pilot and many of the politicians that sort of run for office and get to Washington DC and never planned to leave again because they really think politics and power and DC are the center of the world are and some subset of the consumers of our political news it's about eight percent on the left\nWe work with all kinds of schools in

Bryan\n[noise] ...\nWe're talking to a Ben Sasse [noise] and I have so many places I Would like to go with you um and and talk to the senator about we're going to run out of time uh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me under when you have time\nUm because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation\nYour one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history ... scary and fascinating so somebody some people's shorthand for this of the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship from is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is to pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we began to farm on a on a regular cycle\nAnd from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past with the industrial revolution we get job specialization and it was really disruptive but when people took a job\nThey still kept it till death retirement not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with\nBelieves that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a neighbor driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby\nBut what's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the ... what's often\nWe've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role of life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to being a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nOkay so there's about an hour of questions on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me a ... your\nTake on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars deep fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the ... community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of the fact that we have gone back and the storm is these three ingredients number one\nNew technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that are real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs in college he asked these uh to sow discord in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute now honey trap it affect\nBusiness partner and a bribery scheme and more like you had to get people around people number one is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video\nThat are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take that Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout\nTeam off since I'm On them and ready to do big\nDeep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kinds of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it\nWhere they try to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first\nSeventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taken the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be having a party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually a national security exposure for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slapped an old man wearing a blog a hat and or that\nPerson is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and\nUnderstood and I think in soundbites um it's not a not always understood\nI'm so thank you very much\nFor the un backed good to be with your land but\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you really want to get into him on taking on your own side how do we feel if we're taking on our own side\nI Hope that he will come down and uh\nAnd spend some real time with us\nIf we're not well we know what the solution we know a republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it and I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean\nThe whole foundation of this country is to let people\nCome out and make their arguments and we have to make ours back that does not mean\nI'm a ... minute diplomacy thing and I was so encouraged I Hope you are too\nSo encouraged by the ... a reaction from conservatives she Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a\nPeep of support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hunting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat\nAnd you know here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right and you can there's nothing on the left\nThere will be prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad I mean that's that shows that there's still you know even though we are divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute an emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there so here's where\nI think than was wrong when he said to deal with ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group to smoke room she's right\nIt is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nHe said part of the solution is ignoring\nYeah and I think you know 'cause you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the ... right right you know the Charlottesville situation\nUm you know there is obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when what bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been happening for ever go back for a broken bunch of KKK members walked through your town\nLike ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run\nThey but that's not what we have now we have from ... to a breaking laws you can't ignore the ... came you know you can't ignore though I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore and I don't think\nThat's what argued nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics\nFor getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with\nA few ... a group like ants although that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti father and I think that the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and\nThe solution is to not do what people did in Florida with Nancy Pelosi you don't do that because that doesn't give you a side to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's just\nA minute talk together and about that and yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going\nAgain you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny a media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like\nWell Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like what they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump look how the press treated Kavanaugh everybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they everybody just hardened their positions\nAnd got more outraged the only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said you know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and\nAnd I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then look over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see\n[noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounding on pillows you store and like okay I don't\nWe can't we can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengage then it's just run the country is run by radicals we need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought\nReal actual timed this um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow\nAnd we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing morning first time caller longtime listener I I'll do it in a very good\nOh right yeah and you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida I'm In an independent um most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said\nA tree outside it's so ridiculous I think a lot at the end up and just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes every one of us ties but fat because they just can't talk to each other mhm anymore it's just at our God now that being shed\nEvery one that I Know it's an independent and the state of horror will be showing up for the conservatives\nNovember really and I ... a sham over eat them you've got people in office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home or three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year\nOh I'm bringing home or ... thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge deal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more I got my first uncommon in a\n[laughter] uh yeah I mean yeah\n... ... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian show when you're when you're talking about what these people were after his dad and how they ... themselves into a restaurant it can hurt people when they're eating with their family\nAnd and then the way I Do a church so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides we just ignore it and we're always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as\n... extras culture and I think a lot of people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah then people are a\n... than the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between\nThe two that if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference under which direction we go thanks so much Andrew ... or\nSo filter by is our sponsor and I I brought that

[laughter] at it over the like oh my God yeah right\nSo um so how does somebody like you get elected\nLook it's it's this that Bush meant with establishment right the the established the establishment media stage with the establishment candidates right that's what winds up happening when it comes to debate they thought they do that so\nLook if you mentioned the idea that I have a copy of Cortez right literally she's going to be my Congress person she's she's my district yes in Queens\nAbsolutely and I said this is a good thing and this is a good thing because it shows one thing\nIt shows this is an anti establishment world right now she didn't win because she was amazing and smart and knew everything she wouldn't because she said I'm not the establishment and people rent or her that's one of the reasons why Trump one that's one of reasons why even Obama ones I was an eight I mean anti establishment is a thing that people tend to like now\nThe advantage I have is I met his abdomen here saying how am I going to win if I Can't get the mainstream media by doing what I'm doing now doing pot and cash\nDoing Facebook look Trump one of the reasons why Trump won was Twitter right that wasn't the reason but it was one of the reasons he use that tool and they didn't see him coming\nI use the same tools by I use Twitter I use Facebook I use pod cats I use the same tools they don't like it makes them angry but it's what I'm using they didn't see them coming they didn't see a court has got me either and then once you make coming out\nHowever with Cortez um she was she's been a ... embraced by the establishment on the left the Democrats have become\nDemocratic socialists which is just because you can put the word Democrat in for a democratic in front of it doesn't mean that it's a ... a really wonderful thing\nYeah but there's a thing you need to notice now here even though of course has one Nixon didn't and Nixon actually calls herself a socialist\nWhat happened one state that oh this Cortez person to a different person great let's vote for then they heard what you had to say and you found a lot of New Yorkers went you know what maybe this isn't right and people who voted for Cortez\nShifted and voted for our current governor his magic thinking Andrew Cuomo the second ... so they voted for him again so they went back to establishment after her so I think that

joining us now\nHe is running for governor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a\nNeeds to be introduced to a larger audience how ... what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtained ground you might see in the long time um if probably ever be ab over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a van ... affects our calendar\nI'm making sure people show up social media we have a a team on Twitter team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's Youtube video production\nWe do have not and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf fans of millions of dollars absolutely we raised almost half a million but the beat to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is\nName recognition is my only issue\nThe last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent seem to the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent this is a five way race\nThirty percent when this thing so I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent\nThere is the hard part right the math equation cannot get two hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be ...\nI Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\nYes ... ... ... yes really is as well get again remember at at third party in general the system is that against you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take them to get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration that every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS\nAnd they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even do thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition\nTo get me on that ballot WCBS and they got him him shelling is his name he decided nope Larry shop dozens of beyond their he decided that the ... minutes all that matters this is what I'm up again it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle we have to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably\nUm maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that Tim Shell so this is a radio debate yeah well it's gonna be televised also now okay we both televised on radio ... there'll be both okay\nSo yeah again and they're just deciding no we don't want the dummy wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still roaming and they're still going down that's that's that but they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the mass among mass forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get by forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can give forty four thousand is all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how to use all health care will do that coming up in a just a second\nA standby on TV Tonight is tonight Michael reckon ...\nTonight Michael ... from uh New York university a fascinating guy if you haven't met him yet\nYou will tonight and it will be a something you don't forget a guy who used to write white papers for the Communist Party who now says wait a minute and democratic socialist near the hell out of me\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah the youth you're going to break all of the promises ... who work their whole life and were promised\nYep what do you do you see it here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you said already already happening I may have all the time in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation\nAnd we have all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... so ... is a critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget and a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nIt's double Florida in Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive and it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so the percentages of the other pensions\nBut on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred billion dollar debt and about a fortified they now deficit so it's a bad bad bad anyway you add that people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good\nThey write the fund itself is doing relatively well some of the upstate ... opinion doing very well and it said he wants or disaster but overall it's er and well they don't realize it's being also funded by our tax base a budget that keeps putting money into it\nThe problem is and the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget at one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're saying in Dallas and my response times but Larry in the constitution\nYeah I I get that asked Detroit right at and Puerto Rico right at Venezuela and it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse\nIf that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight I don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right and which is some type of four one K. for three be something like that and I'm going to go she with every single union that will take forever I Know\nThat's why I say it's a four year plan it's a four year plan to make as to what New York state is paying either\nA flat fee and or a flat presented that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people are pensions who no longer\nPaying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they do need pennies anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting\nTend to Iraq I think she was a ... for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making then I mean I think it's on I think it was supporting three or four or so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying light wants to get rid of our pensions\nI'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them I'm the only one talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you have a ... if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist tease he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care I have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's going to collapse and I have to move\nAnd I don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends were in New York state I Love my state ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government New York state is very special it has served the largest city in the entire nation\nIt has an amazing waterfall and I go falls it has mountains as cool as Colorado and has from Lennon who'll as yes I'm In New York ... no ... no farmland as cool as the mid west\nIt has amazing rivers and lakes and everything you can imagine in New York state is there it's a beautiful diverse state and with destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state most of my my ideas about happiness but the other part is by decentralization it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns beach towns\nRight people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and there are bad and cut them off if you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City be New York city like isn't Ryan W ... Rochester\nIsn't that what we're we're debating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college just because it's the original debate I don't want New York city yeah so tell me in the middle of the country how to live\nMy life yes don't let San Francisco bay San Francisco ... poop on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here yes\nAnd maybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refine what at right everything is\nAnd they should be allowed to do to their city their county what they want to do\nA hundred percent true and it's not happening and the issue as we're getting more and more centralized control\nIt happens in any large organization that I told you I'm a business guy right and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses and fix the make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist it's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes\nMy my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I can't get to innovate I can to to take it because you're taking your all your things and the last thing I say it's iron fist I say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation\nPersonal freedom plus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time so you give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge some will make mistakes as ... as long as you ... you learn from them you become humbled by them which is fine we all make mistakes\nBut then which are the ones who simply want to make a mistake blame someone else now you see that these leaders you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes\nThere doing nothing those elite as you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humble to become better leaders in the long run that how you make a better organization we don't have that\nLeary is going to join me for a a pod cast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday\nUm Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I I have a feeling or if he doesn't win New York we're going to be seeing him a again a perhaps\nThe elsewhere but he is um he's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York\nConsider voting for can't imagine I\nCan't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Larry sharp a S.
