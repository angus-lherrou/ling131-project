Congress to check Trump\nFifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no\nAlso by the way the founders said yes to that one yet and that it to any president right I've ... the role that shouldn't be the first one hundred percent\nUm do you support them lower investigation\nFifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent\nVoters compare that with another poll yes is the Russia investigation a witch hunt forty nine percent say yes\nForty seven percent say no it's interesting they support the investigation but they do believe that it's politically motivated and with no real end to it\nThis is this this poll is the first time and you're not going to get this without this who's publishing all of it or they'll just give you the highlights of they'll say oh you know fifty two percent say that the lower\nInvestigation yeah but they won't say forty nine percent also think that it's a witch hunt so people are nuanced\nYeah they they think it's worth looking into um you know right either looking into it just to make sure but we don't think there's anything there\nThis one's surprises me elect more feminists forty nine percent say yes thirty three percent say no\nAnd uh that's similar to the women question that right I mean it's like a generalized question feminist I don't think people are really familiar with the ideology enough to know and it depends

no\nGet let me part of this was another one too I mean abolish ice is a\nComplete fringe position right just to say bunkers left wing physician yes um and that type of thing that even Cory Booker dodges questions about uh however pair that with the support that thirty percent support their\nThe support of Trump's tariffs thirty three percent\nWithin the margin of error of abolish ice that's how popular that that idea is now I don't care if it's a hundred percent approval I Would still oppose it because I don't think it's a good idea but it is not even at a popular proposal if not winning

three no or sorry thirty three yes fifty five percent\nOr know twelve percent I I don't know reverse racism is a bigger issue than racism to your question yeah forty percent say yes it's it's it's unbelievable it's forty percent\nOf the you know it it the the question is never been is it a bigger problem per se is the question has always been does it exist at all\nBut I think that's what the forty percent is saying there that they deny the press denies that it doesn't even exist here either independence saying forty percent of independents going yeah yeah and worse than we do it works and what we typically think of race right now I'm at the ... it it but number it ah it verifies that it does exist\nOr what Republicans to keep the house forty percent say yes forty five percent say no approve of Trump forty one percent of independents say yes fifty one say no just a quickly\nPair that again I mean forty one percent approve of Trump of forty nine percent of the Russia investigation as a witch hunt that's those are two together that same\n... it's pretty interesting ah you support Kavanaugh's confirmation forty four percent yes forty five percent no or his help the Trump helped you economically forty seven to forty seven\nUh the Russia investigation as a witch hunt forty nine to forty seven we are a divided nation but\nWe really we have to keep our crap together we really

so interesting the Chinese buying is continuously going up\nAnd it's going up without stopping the Chinese know what's happening\nThey know and they're continuing to buy gold [noise] one day that's going to have a major influence on the gold price when the paper market breaks China dominates the gold market it's going to be very interesting I look forward to the west failing in their

it is used a before it used to be in London and stay in New York and it would be traded between the various banks\nThese banks now are getting the gold from central banks and they give the central bank and I owe you again in normal times the gold would stay in London or ... or New York but now that gold is going via Switzerland to China and India and it will not come back\nSo\nWhat does that mean for months I had been telling you that\nAll of the countries all around the world are calling their goal back they're all calling the gold back\nThis is at some point either going to leave us with nothing because of what's called ... and that's another show or a a a war because there's not enough gold\nFor all the money that we all printed in borrowed so what happens\nNobody is paying attention to countries hey Russia and China saying we're going on war footing and countries all around the world calling the gold back\nThere's something happening and you need to know about it and
