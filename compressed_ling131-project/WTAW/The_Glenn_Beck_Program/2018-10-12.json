W. College Station Bryan [noise]\nLet's talk a little bit about uh what the Democrats should be learning in what they're not learning Kavanaugh since that uh since that nightmare looks like the poll numbers are are switching dramatically at least in the Senate\nYeah then it pulls have been really good for Republicans since the Kavanaugh saying which I don't know if that's a huge surprise to anybody but\nI mean you know Beto is now down by looked like eight to Ted Cruz which has about doubled the lead he had before then and then as bill mentioned Taylor Swift comes out talks about how bad Marsha Blackburn in his latest poll has her up by fourteen and which was thought to be a toss up race\nYeah I mean it's I I don't think they were Democrats are learning their lesson and yet they're doubling down built it I'd like to hear your thoughts on on what Eric Holder said this weekend Hillary Clinton\nYeah I um I I pay more attention to what a China washing Taylor Swift\nAnd a good question and right now\nI'm done a show of things that Eric Holder is really a steady than uh Oprah's ... and and they look like you should put that up on the ... side by side\nAnyway um they're just a few interesting things in play here Beto ... has raised thirty eight million dollars in the last six months or so which is breaks every work in the world where's that money coming from it's coming from ...\n... as soon as guys in the Hollywood people and all that so he'll stay competitive and you'll lose 'em\nI'd hang on let me stop there you know what I've met people who have given to both sides millions of dollars they're not happy\nWith the party that loses when you give a lot of money and the party says no this is the one this is going to change everything and then you lose especially if they lose by eight points\nThose are normal people ... the real shadowy guys that's what's Beddoes getting I'm getting at big Soros money coming in\nGuys that's what's Beddoes getting I'm getting a big Soros money coming in I guess maybe I'm a native and the all the they just want\nYou know search and destroy so I think that you know I I agree with you back and that always hurts my toes when I said I I'm that there is a backlash and that the cabin a spectacle alienated decent and when I say decent I mean fair minded\nPeople yeah both Democrat and Republican\nYou know when you have and and I and I bring up a lot I'm no on working for you and no one working for me I could have tweeted out well Kavanaugh was confirmed but at least we destroyed his life\nMember that tweet yes who did it come from came from Letterman's a writer's\nCold there ... sorry okay when I asked him for a cold they're both\nSaid one of the writers are cold there tweeted that out okay ... when most hateful things I've ever seen so that happened to your organization my organization and that person wouldn't be working\nFor us if we would have if we would have to eat it out but at least we got a Ford least we at least we rarely destroyed her it would have been all horror show but I Would not be working today\nAnd they probably couldn't go out free so people know this\nUm even if you like cold there which I don't I'm not even if you are sympathetic to a doctor for it and and all of that me to stuff even if you're buying into it you've got to know All right that the\nRhetoric and the plan to destroy human beings is not what America is all about\nYou know it's not\nAnd and you know when you think in history Stalin and Hitler and and what they did by destroying their opposition or you know later on I was physically but in the beginning they couldn't murder people but they did it other ways\nAnd that's exactly what we're seeing here in America the hate is rising the fear is rising all of this is in play\nAnd guys like you and I unfortunately we have to fight against us and then that puts us in the kill zone but to get back to the politics I Do think there's going to be a backlash I'm not sure about the house of representatives but the Senate I Believe will um be even more Republican than it is now\nSo let me let me ask you this if if they do\nHave they they lose the Senate where just a few weeks ago\nThe the person who is in the best position to win for the Republicans\nWas Ted Cruz and he was only one or two points ahead of of Beto so he was in the best position now it looks like they could if I mean if it's a good day they could end up with the majority of fifty four fifty five yeah that's significant if\nEspecially with you know Donald Trump is president do the most hated man of all time if if\nThey do lose do you think they will say okay wait a minute this democratic socialism this anger or no I\nNever got to do that they're going to go they're going to go murder don't you think\nOf course I mean these people are really really do arranged and and there are some on the on the right like that as well yes but not nearly\nA the numbers on the left of course a media promotes that um but if they win the Democrats win the house then you're ... that's why are you going to hear\nYour in your area about ... yes I'm In the house you know that's a little shaky because as everybody knows uh the first term and Clinton first CERN Obama um they lost\nYour um and and the opposition party you only have one of the house right and if you're the way Americans do usually vote\nYeah so bill how do you feel about the use of the N word\nThe M.

I'm sure I'm you're listening to the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nAll right and I'm a quick uh announcement to make a for the blaze the blaze radio network is I'm a very fast and growing or a very big and fast growing a network of people that are are are listening all around the country\nWho would like a you know sometimes I'm a a a a a strong look at the view of the news and also a\nFunny look at the news ah and today we're announcing a couple of changes if you happen to have listened to the blaze radio network you know that we always had the morning place with a duck Thompson ducks been with us for a long time\nIf you ever listen to him you know his entrepreneurial spirit and he for a long time has wanted to start his own thing a and he has and he built it while he was working here and we all knew about it it's a mode Joe I think ... ... and it is a it's something it's his own thing\nHow could I not how could I Do anything but love a guy who says I Want to strike out on my own that's great and good for you\nAre and so we wish him all the success in the world and uh we wish him the very very best on mo Jo five oh that left on opening well we happened to have the best morning guy\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to lead me off and doesn't care about me guy does tend to one at minimum it's not even close and then the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate ...\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\nUm I mean he has he has embraced the what whether it's the NFL issue which is kind of become a phony issue now but all of the cultural flash points you know I've always believed that Mitt Romney would have just eating a chicken sandwich about mid August of two thousand and sixteenth or two thousand twelve\nWhen you're a chick fillet day he'd have been pressing United States but he won't even eat chicken sandwich every every moment Mitt Romney had a chance in that campaign to punt on a cultural flashpoint he did every moment John McCain had to hunt on a cultural flashpoint even lecturing guys like you about not using Brock Obama's real middle name remember those days and if he punted on every one of those\nTrump said cultural flashpoints I'm aware I'm going to put it on my face marinated debated whether I Believe any of this stuff or not I'm a businessman and I know when the market wants a product\nAnd I'm going to give it to them and you see the way that our base responded to that\nCase so let's talk about uh the uh the result of that the good things in the bad things in what the Democrats are now saying and go back to the violence that I told you at the beginning of the half hour\nOr when we come back again Steve days begins on the blaze radio network and a and also he remains on the ... to

College Station Bryan\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with Steve days pat gray a stew steeper\nGear or executive producer and of course my charming self\nUm we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video up somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is the is this the\nOr is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nUh um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with any sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a bill but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with the stability thing\nThat they're completely uh uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change that say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this\nLeftist movement I I think it's the latter mhm and I

to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange Dutch truth for a ally so there's one big macro\nIsn't there when you exchange Dutch truth for a ally so there's one big macro truth in in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes rights are about supply so when you change that truth for a law you're given over to a database to mine\nAnd that's what you're talking about and I
