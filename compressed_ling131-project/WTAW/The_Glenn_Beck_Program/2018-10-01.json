to ask every single person in this audience I Want you to ask your friends this\nLet's imagine for a second that every single person that you want elected from\nFrom dog catcher to president of the United states\nThat every person you want elected\nAnd they are putting in all of the policies that you want\nIt's it's your utopia\nThere remains about fifty percent of the country and I'm going to be really generous I going to make it a lot easier\nThere's thirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia\nThey just want to go in a different direction\nWhat do you do with the forty percent of the population that does not agree with you\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds of others\nSo your perfect utopia\nStarts to fall apart\nWhat happens with the ones who won't comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia it remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election\nAnd if if history tells us anything it swings the other direction what once you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't\nYou have gone over the cliff\nBecause in America the answer to what are you going to do\nTo all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing\nWhat are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing\nWhat do you do to to silence those who will not comply the answer in America is nothing\nSo any time somebody says\nWe should shout these people down\nThey've taken the first step\nAll thought is creative\nWhen you begin to speak things\nThey use speak them into existence\nWhen you say we shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we should disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality is created in that direction\nOn what you say and what you think\nThe answer to these questions in America must remain\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me with me\nI Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\nI Will state my case and I will Duke it out on the battlefield of ideas\nI Will not silence other people\nI Will not smear or destroy other people I Will not to become everything I despise\nI Will not to become a fascist just stop fascism\nIn a minute with the libertarian candidate for governor of New York Larry shark when we come back in\nI look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that\nI Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have and wrinkle gave me many of them and that was a a great thing that the marine corps the military is not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps\nI would've been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine corps helped me tremendously\nAnd when I got a Marine Corps about seven years later [noise] um my mom had really gone into a very bad place um she couldn't handle me leaving she couldn't handle my father's death and she was addicted first illegal drugs and eventually illegal drugs and and she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon\nSo I pulled her out of prison and I used my whatever things I had to try to get her back up and running\nA reading her an apartment in the house that I mean I'm I'm a car that kind of thing and she struggled and if you if you had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be ride they have that on their record and then they feel less then and then when they get a job there hostage to that job because they're afraid to do the job for them\nAnd it's just bad bad bad so I said you know what I'm going to do something I've been taken actually my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with a ball says you can't fire her such so we started on bits became ... became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business\nNothing as a matter of God Bless America had NATO was with what I have a\nChoice I allow my mother to be hostage or I Do something I was my option go to business school was that what I was going to do\nA low no right I ...\nI don't I never I never have and never will ever measure any plan I have against perfection because perfection doesn't work I measure my plan again status quo because that is cool is what I have status quo was my mother as a hostage I don't accept status quo\nSo we've had business as well um my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it\nAnd she ran until she retired and when she retired she did with too many New Yorkers do and that is leave New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire um so she did that in ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago but after that that's when I went off to do my own thing I had many different jobs and then decided you know what\nThe first visit ... let me try another one so I started my second business and that's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I said we're not that's when I first heard you back when you want your Philly station I'm In the morning show\nGet outta here yes that's when I first heard you doing your ah your jokes um about an hour and a stand [laughter] I remember that I remember I was I was I was driving around and and I was actually listen to you I think you a ten am I yeah yeah I think so yeah and I am\nYes when your your morning show I remember listening to back then and um then I did that and I sold that business off it and not do as well as I wanted to be to do but I was called at my MBA that failure was my MBA I'm from that I have one more job\nAnd then started this job now that this is now that I have which I'm a trainer consultant teacher so I have large clients like a ... and that's the laughter and smaller clients like small law firms I teach um leadership and executive posted each business I've been an executive in a public company twice\nAs a a band aid and I've taught him many colleges have groups John J. and I've taught as a guest instructor at the graduate level of a Yale and Colombia\nAnd now the about what have you done with your life seriously and what have you know I I'm a loser I'm Sorry yeah holy has so oh you are a guy that to me seems tailor made for the times that we live in I I mean I think Iraq Obama\nWas also in in some ways tailor made for the times that we live in and I don't think he lived up to his potential\nUm the the more division happened um we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with ah with credibility somebody who can speak to prison reform\nWith credibility and not an axe to grind but common sense and experience\nYes I mean this is the thing that I talk about all the time you know I've dealt with and seeing the prison system from both you know both sides my father's rushes off from my mother as as a felon and I say the same thing as I say in business and that is when you want to fix something you don't walk in and start dictating\nWhen you do that you get rebellion when you do that people say no\nThe issue that we have particularly in New York state but throughout the country is we have\nTo start a two sided thinking right as you said before a binary I either every corrections officers a thug and every single person there is a victim or every prisoner is evil and should be killed in every corrections officer is perfect and neither is true the reality of it is to fix this\nIs the situation in prison we have to have the corrections officers as part\nOf the solution and that's hard for people to understand because they think they're part a system yes but they see people every day what I Know for sure in prison right now we have people in jail who should probably never get out ever who are bad people should never got out and there are people who made a mistake\nShould pay that society and should then get a second chance and people probably shouldn't be in jail at all the issue is I don't know which one is which and I never will but you know who does\nCorrections officers who deal with them every day\nThose are the people who deal with the inmates everyday how do I know that to be true you look at Massachusetts right now they have the Humvee program which is a program that has\nCEOs corrections officers and volunteers from outside together with a specific community in this case the communities veterans but you can pick any community a community that the seals knowing that they see in prison everyday\nYou make that happen to all of us what happens you now at people who've had that problem coming as volunteers nurse or tax money you also have corrections officers who know how to control people know which people who can get in there no those who will be scanning and well now see those who are scanning and we'll put the people who need to have the rights\nThe right to the second chance out there in his program\nHow do we know that the recipient rate in Massachusetts in general is about Seventy five percent when this program less than five percent holy do\nNo no specialized people coming in corrections officer into it here's the problem in New York say specifically for corrections officers ... the the the life expectancy is fifty eight years that ... years old not just that every corrections officer I've met either know someone who committed suicide and or a knows someone\nWho is so ready to leave they had become completely apathetic to assist them this is a problem\nAll of them tell me the same thing Larry you know I'm I'm already there their therapist I'm already there their marriage ... I'm already they're legal assistant already help them out with all kinds of things I'm already trying to help them\nThere are so many CEOs who would happily ship into this world without having to change any we're adding anybody giving them an actual contract they haven't had a contract and three years in the upstate that's how bad it is so we could actually fix things\nThis is repair trouble if we actually use both sides and\nGo in and asked the people who are there how to fix it that's how you are in the business\nGoing to ask the people who are there how to fix it that's how you business that's how you fix in life\nBut Larry do you have time can I hold you for a while could kind of silly show okay ah I Want to take a break because I I Want to talk to you about the economy I Want to talk to you about business and you know the direction of California where they've they've just a mandated that you know women now have to be on the board of directors\nA ... we're going in it completely bizarre a a direction\nAnd I would love to hear how you think you could make New York a a\nA more of a sane place\nLarry sharp he's running for governor or as the libertarian\nA and I'm I'm telling you if you were looking for a candidate in a New York you could play the same game or you can try something different\nI Want you to listen to Larry sharp if you're in New York\nOh All right we'll be back with him in just a second person we tell you about car shield car shield\nOur shield is a a shield really not around your car as much as your wallet\nThat's what I think it shields when you bring your car in for repair and your car has I don't know five thousand two hundred and fifty thousand miles and your your warranty has expired Europe for everything now\nAnd you have to replace a sensor and it could be Fifteen hundred bucks let alone replay or you know replacing your engine or something you know something massive five six thousand dollars\nI had some things that went wrong with with one of my old trucks up at the uh up at the ranch and brought it in didn't know that this was going to happen just was bringing in for oil they found something ... it was about six grand sixty five hundred the reason why I don't remember exactly how much is it because I didn't pay for it car shielded\nThat's what it means to have your wallet and your car\nCovered with car shield\nCar shield it's the ultimate in extended vehicle protection before something goes wrong called them right now eight hundred car sixty one hundred\nEight hundred cars sixty one hundred mentioned to promote go back or visit car shield dot com and use the promote go back and you're going to save ten percent that scar shield dot com ... deductible may apply [noise]\nCyber criminals can attack your laptop your tablets smartphones\nAnd they do it without warning without even knowing they can steal your identity you're not going to realize that until it's too late that's why lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of Norton Security to help protect your identity and devices lifelike uses proprietary technology to help detect a range of threats\nIt's a great deal for all three countries so I'm Dave Anthony Fox News President Trump tweeted out about the agreement with Canada worked out just before midnight\nJoining Mexico and he is just about to talk about it at the White House ceremony commerce secretary Wilbur Ross says\nThis is fundamental reform and now there is no more after\nThis new agreement would mean the end of NAFTA\nSo long as Congress give the thumbs up possibly a vote at some point next year and the administration is saying this morning that this is a major win for the auto industry a major win for farmers as well specifically dairy farmers and that's\nFox Business network like ... when the new deal going over big on Wall street that day I was up two hundred sixty points the Supreme Court is back in session with an empty seat today the eight justices moving on without Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation votes been delayed by new FBI investigation Fox is Jared helper live at the Capitol and one\nWoman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct has spoken with FBI agents Deborah Ramirez says the Supreme Court nominee exposed himself to her during a party in the early Nineteen eighties when both were students at Yale\nKevin has categorically denied that accusation and other allegations no one to review from his high school and college years the sex crimes prosecutor who questioned another woman accusing cabinet of sexual assault\nHis old Senate Republican she does not think reasonable prosecutor would bring the case a final confirmation vote has not yet been scheduled named\nJared has been a cheery morning in Las Vegas she\nJoined me in fifty eight fifty eight seconds just silence and chairs the memories that are beautiful angels and live on in our heart\n...

says let teachers teach and then does not administrators on their own without that my goal was to remove administrators to allow teachers to actually teach we have school district in New York state

state makes about eighty K. the average administration makes over six figures\nYou get rid of to administrators that's either two new teachers or raises Omar quip meant and to what point earlier I

control but you're paying the state is paying for teachers that have been abused children and yet they are sitting in rubber rooms\nAnd that's my point once was most of that is happening because of both Albany and D.C control and Albany and easy money from DC we get about four billion dollars every year and that controls a lot\nWhen that money begins to go away number one that will help but second thing is I'm not beholden to union leadership if they get mad at me so what your leadership is not going to vote for me anyway I don't eat Seventy percent of New Yorkers to vote for me I Need thirty percent of those who vote\nYou just said forty four billion dollars goes away from the federal government is corrupt how are you going to have what are you gonna replace that with\nAbsolutely
