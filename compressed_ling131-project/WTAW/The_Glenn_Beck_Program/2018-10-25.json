kind of weird I agree completely I can run off as quickly yeah it was like going there by ... acquaintances home or someone you don't know that well it's actually stranger than you know not taking them off\nSo and what they're trying to tell you is there are so many germs on your shoes that it could that they've they've got some stuff that apparently bacterium will cause stomach pain and

washed their feet right wipe your life your prize yeah so anyway here's the deal is is is so there's this this stuff out there that could come in on your shoes\nAnd so what they're saying is of course the thing is if anybody comes in and they walk in there and that stuff is on their shoes then you come in and take let's say you come in and you take your sandals often your barefoot right then what are your ...\nCan they go round like Lincoln the floor at my house after someone walked through\nEight or what they tell you is vacuum and clean the carpet at least once a week\nOh we lost that you're

and are you today\nI'm doing well how are you to ... he wrote a gift with you I did of course I had missed Lindsay can be here and she is one of our special projects she is she your regular yes absolutely and and the city so she's going to talk to us about a bunch of things going on\nIt's the closest thing to looking into a crystal ball when you talk to Lindsey 'cause she got to tell just what the future is going to look like you do have a couple of things that are that are on the drawing board that are going to change the liquor Brian let's let's talk about downtown first to the north in projects\nGreat great well thanks for having me here this morning and we are very excited to let everybody know that we are very close to releasing a request for proposals\nFor a development partner in our downtown north properties and those are the properties right down by the premier ice house a between Brian and Brian in Maine and again their properties that the city of Bryan owns and we'll be looking towards I'm finding somebody to partner with for\nAnother fantastic development in downtown north\nShore and ... there's a green area right there and then of course their buildings all around on the other side of the some of his had some new development over on the east side of that if you will\nBut generally when you go to an RSP use these things are golden shorthand um I guess it could be all over the board so you kinda have to put some parameters on that are there some guidelines in that or if they could give us at least some inkling as to what this would finally liquid\nYeah absolutely so you know we are willing to take 'em a proposals from a variety of different developers teams on any configuration of a lot\nBut generally speaking you know we're going to encourage next use 'em we want density so three four five stories\nUm we are looking for some flexible space components on that\nAllow the general public to use the property and and enjoy the things in downtown or so we certainly don't want to see the property be paved from Atlanta lot line so we definitely want some of that open space public space green space whatever you want to call it\nUm for the public to enjoy and certainly we're going to focus on um getting folks downtown ideally there could be a residential component um you know anytime we can bring more folks there to be there after hours when the the business folks leave that size is certainly encouraged\nBut again we're not going to exclude anything um we're gonna we want to look at all proposals we want any ideas we certainly\nUm don't believe that we have the best idea of going into it so you know we're open to to see what people have to say\nThen I guess the reason is as important as that once that is done once the people who own adjacent property she was going there then that's going to help guide them as to what they want to do\nYes ideally on you will see and the development in downtown north and have a trickle effect and start improve and we're already we're already seeing it absolutely\nSo in some ways um some of the development going on around that will help maybe help guide what's going to happen in our property so it's going to work both ways but we definitely seeing it having a positive effect\nOn directly adjacent to those properties bedroom but really the you know the whole downtown or the area\nAs you look at Brian is kind of a quarter of development that's happening down adjacent to College Station that started years ago when we we started to see new sidewalks new pavement a new facility new homes that are being built there or housing\nNow the midtown area this is of course everybody understands there's going to be a park a really big park there but there's more to midtown than just that would talk to us a little bit of a\nIt'll have slowly so and there have been planning efforts underway for months now for the regional park um but we took it a step further and last month approved a contract to really focus on\nOn the area what we call north of north gate mhm\nI'm into the downtown court or down south college incense either and we really see that as an area having some wonderful growth potential um it really is that perfect gateway from the campus to downtown on the regional park is right in the middle of that\nSo we're going to over the next six to eight months really take a look at that\nAnd look at the economics of the area we are going to look at the existing neighborhoods and how to protect those established neighborhoods\nHow do we accommodate student housing in the area that next year's retail it's really has a little bit of everything and we want to keep the kind of eclectic unique feel of the south college court or\nBut make sure that we are planning for the growth in doing it really is\nFeel of the south college court or but make sure that we are planning for the growth and doing it really in a smart way\nSure well and that's the other thing is just speculation redevelopment does does become a problem for some people as property values go up but I liked the idea that you say you'd like to kind of keep just a little electric is a nice thing\nAnd then also they're going to have to be more road improvements but I think we all the ... we appreciate now that it's done almost all the improvements like like everything else any other areas that are your focus after these two major projects get done where do we go next\nUm well you know we have big developments going on both on the east side in the west side\nAnd we had the university Dr extension and oh come on we have traditions atlas a lake walk so we are constantly focusing on those areas as well and a university you drive should be open and the next month or two so\nYou know I think you're going to see a growth on both sides of this town of both sides of the town continue as well\nSure how long you been in the city Seventeen years pretty amazing isn't it

bigger media companies in town but we're the only one that's locally owned and operated WG a College Station Bryan\n\nGlenn Beck and you'll get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on Halloween or black or white low in\nLike a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character there was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with land as she got Diana Ross and she made her scandalous darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd like who doesn't want to and she wants to look like I Am around for one day\nI I don't know how like that got race on Halloween\n... amazing ... and is it is it is that such a question that you should be drummed out of all society right that that's what's amazing about the first of all we should point out that\nThere's a lot of people in and side of NBC that one in her out for other reasons oh my gosh Shelly ... this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and been applauded had she not come from Fox\nAnd she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever the that crowd would've applauded her saying that and I think they know there's a lot of people don't be seated didn't appreciate her coming out against NBC\nPersonalities on the sexual assault stuff ... as well\nBut just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exists and talk about the fact that actual conversation\nHer point is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation\nRight the motivation is what is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important let's go further than black face for a second the N. word right\nThe N. word when said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it not so bad why because we know Chris Rock motivation\nIs not because he is terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in this been sorry for the city of Charlottesville who knows if they're named just sit on to this with racism but I mean you know we're talking about here\nThe the if you have an outright figure you have Richard Spencer if some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different and that is important\nLike it but I Will say this it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get drunk out of society correct you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not the deep hatred of racism another example\nIt's always sunny in Philadelphia is a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history fourteen season's going I signed up for the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episode where would the white characters were in blackface K now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface\nBut they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program OK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of an outcry from the leftover it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times\nThey did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black and they they have a situation where they all wake up after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live with black people for the day\nAnd they walk around an orderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know the animation but it's still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is that he he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to the black people are inferior or anything like that\nThey're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay what she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of theirs that happens to be black\nAnd they don't want to be damaging dynamics right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well that and you'd think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true\nWe may say as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay\nBut the issue is her asking that question she'd saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can't handle that level of conversation Mm\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his uh partied deliberate which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis is just the latest stunned ... blames America and has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he now claims has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through this is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because they blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more he writes than a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report\nSome of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet this is really sad and frustrating because many migrants\nAre have been a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals\nAre a might have been the organizers of the march we'll take advantage of please keep spreading the truth about this situation\nI enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks for being a truth teller\nIn a world of lies God Bless you and the family at the blaze\nFor all that you do from someone who lives and was born and raised in Honduras that is verifying exactly what we were we're being told what we can do or you know just as [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou know I was going to say you know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters and then thought of journalists 'cause they're not really a journalist but then I thought of ... he's a he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know\nBut everyone keeps saying I I think columnist would be more accurate uh well he wrote five five five columns\nFor the Washington Post that of course makes you a journalist does it ...\nFive ... I mean you probably written five ... columns here to have places like the rest of ... I I did something for the Washington Post at one point to the gym I notice now\nYou're a journalist or journalists aren't doing their jobs the ... me news organizations don't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's really going on with that care of and\nUm we hope to have Michael Yon before the end of the program today to talk a little bit about what they're doing about this in the Congress and the Senate and what the president can do a and how we can hold Mexico accountable\nAnd these other countries accountable if they just pass their problem on to us\nI feel for on doors because these guys are the guys who are causing trouble in their own country they're having to deal with these guys all the time\nAnd our press is not duped by them this is why\nIt's hard to defend the press when they say we're not an enemy of the people yeah yeah I agree you're not an enemy of the people but you are definitely an enemy of the truth\nAnd whether that is intentional or you are just unbelievably\nA\nLacking all curiosity all natural curiosity you just start unbelievable\nIn how a daddy inside you are on trying to find anything other than what people are just telling you in the next cubicle what'd you all just are agreeing on oh look at this bombs come in\nThere's ten of them none of them have gone off they're they're they're not even pipes there's they're PVC pipes that defeats the reason of having a pipe bomb you want the shrapnel of the middle\nOf the pipe as it blows up well yes but they put glass inside a glass glass is not the same as ball bearing you put metal not glass you put metal in these things\nPlus\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a timer why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail\nWould\nYou expect somebody to open it up and then like I guess I should set this for two minutes\nThat doesn't make any sense that kind of seems like that's what happened with um with the George Soros one someone else picked it up from his mailbox opened it up saw that it was some device walked over to the\nWoods and put it down then called the police and the police came and blew it up right but I mean that's like ... if this was a a bomb that was supposed to be triggered by being opened doesn't seem that to be that there's a timer on it you think it's a it's a time bomb but you don't set a time through the mail\nI Do this and it's it's ridiculous very strange ridiculous uh let me go to Kim in Virginia who is a US mail carrier\nOr hello Kim\nHey Ryan I'm actually from outside of Charlotte sale [laughter]\nOh what a hateful racist even those\nThat I remember ...\nYeah well I I just want to point out that the guys who organized that in Charlottesville we're from Florida so just how\nI could not family after my family to try to catch the guys we want to be a part but I wanted my kids to share that like you're not going to learn history unless they get at least by a car well anyway All right well actually there anyway yeah I Do now carrier then about three years um I find that in ... in an adult attended an al at all\nUm it's about three years in first class parcel\nI'm Out here

been process I take it back in ... you know anything about ... or anything like that to me that all these red flag like what\nIn it you know anything about a letter anything so that that to me that all these red flag is like what the ... how are they getting the rhetoric and it's not the postal service well that was the one that I saw the picture I shouldn't say all\nYeah well there was one today that was found in the uh postal office in Delaware I think there's another one you say that yeah so\nI I I Wonder if the same thing I look for the cancellation though they didn't do ... and

of mattresses and you're not going to tell anything because it takes a few days before you before you really your body can adjust to the bed to say no is not right for me it's too soft it's too hard

PVC pipe will be obliterated you want the pipe it's the shrapnel that uh is important for the pipe\nOr they also didn't put ball bearings or anything else and if they put glass which was not again not as effective um if you're making a a pipe bomb they also had a cheap timer a wired to it why would you put a timer on something that is going through the mail\nOr the wires run the outside what was it just doesn't make any sense this just doesn't make any sense if you wanted to kill people it also had a a a a right wing name on it a had a the Arabic\nFlag or the ISIS flag and underneath that it just said get her done why would you put that on a pipe bomb\nAnd how come none of\nThem went off because they're not hard to do this has happened before in fact it was it was really quite bad\nNineteen Nineteen mayday Nineteen Nineteen uh\nAnarchists and communists decided that they were going to target um people that were in the FBI the Justice Department newspaper editors the mayor of Seattle who was anti union at the time it mentioned that\nBusiness people senator of Georgia received one of these bombs his housekeeper picked it up when she tried to open the male she opened did bluer hands off the senator's wife lost teeth her face was horribly scarred from fire it was horrible horrible\nTwelve bombs went off twelve bombs went off Seventeen were in the mail that they caught before they were delivered\nSo this has happened before\nLater the next month of June eight bombs were set around the country in major cities did massive damage these were all to protest the anti immigration rules that had been put in they\nWere saying let's slow down on some of the immigrants coming in because we have to know if they're good guys or bad guys because we're bringing in a lot of people that believe in socialism in communism\nAnd they believe in revolution and we know what happened in Russia we can't have those people come in here\nAnd that's why the communists the immigrants in this particular case were bombing\nWhen the bombs went off it's interesting\nWhen the bombs went off\nIt's interesting that everything there was a note came with all of these bombs see if that sounds familiar it says war\nYes class war because you're the first to wage it under the cover of the powerful institutions you call order and in the darkness of your uh laws is that something that could be written by the left today\n\nIt didn't just happen once the next year September sixteenth Nineteen twenty but Wall Street bombing one hundred and forty three people were seriously injured thirty eight were dead\nThink of the impact at that time\nOne hundred and forty three seriously injured thirty eight dead\nThis\nLeads me to if I'm ever in New York and people are have not been to New York there's a few places I like to take them and one place I always take them is twenty three Wall Street across the street is where George Washington gave his first inaugural address\nCross the street and the other direction is Wall Street the New York stock exchange you know where that is then there's the building it's called the corner\nAnd it's a building if I showed it to you you would recognize that you've seen in a million times it was built in Nineteen Thirteen by a J. P. Morgan it was the Morgan house if you will his office was in there\nOne of the bombs went off right next to that building\nBut Morgan had built this classical building so deep and so thick that it didn't penetrate anything thirty eight people killed a hundred and forty three severely injured the bomb went off just off of the sidewalk and it didn't affect his building\nExcept there are ... marks from the shrapnel in the building look it up twenty three Wall Street\nYou'll see the shrapnel on the side of that building the pocket parks and Morgan said we're not going to repair it leave it there\nAs a symbol that no one scares us no one is going to push us into a revolution no one is going to scare us leave it there\nDon't try to hide or cover up those pockmarked now I don't know how many people\nIn the media today even know that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're saying this is unprecedented and it has to be the right\nHistorically speaking it's almost always the left now this might be the right but it might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done or\nAnd so this guy built these bombs and build them in such a way that they were never\nGoing to explode I don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them\nWent off\nRemember Nineteen Nineteen twelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off\nSeventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could\nGo off this time not a single bomb went off\nWe're dealing with somebody who has not just a lack of sophistication but is completely incompetent and may be crazy and I thank God for that no one was hurt or injured but there is the other possibility\nThis is meant to look like a bomb\nBut not act like a bomb\nWhat do you say we actually do the investigation\nWho really did it\nThen we can point fingers\nIn the process so Mike I gotta I got an uh an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras said been following the news or on the caravan here locally\nUh been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in two thousand nine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a ... a a lack of\nAnd the president of Honduras Manuel ... a a lack of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutionally by the other two branches of government\nEver since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many of the things are have been tried by ... and his party ...\nWhich translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis latest sons of as a ... a blames America and has made America is now reaping what its own type statements he says that America must take into migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he claims is caused all the misery that we uh Hondurans are living through sadly the migrants had been lied to and have been told that America must accept them\nIn one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel on once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting for them some of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nWhat's really sad and frustrating is many of these migrants have been a told that they will get in and they'll have jobs waiting for them when they arrive in America there for many or good with hopes of a better life\nBut this is the type of situation that these criminals are who are the originator of this march will take advantage of\nSomebody's messing with them and we have to remember that most members of the Caribbean or ineligible for asylum or earlier this year or the department of justice clarify that you cannot claim asylum\nSimply because your home country is unsafe by definition by law aside least face in individual in particular I danger in their home countries\nAnd because there's no legal basis for the vast majority of those in a caravan to remain in the United states uh we end up doing what we can what we can to prevent people from making the journey at all that but this this statement you just read is part of it is a\nNarrative is false rhetoric that is perpetuating the problem and I think it needs to be called out as such\nJust because they have a country that is a mess of the government that has made light unpleasant for everyone there is not mean that any particular person necessarily has a valid claim for asylum in the United states\n[noise] Mike have you heard have you heard anything talking to Senator Mike Lee have you heard anything about what Mike Pence revealed I think it was not yesterday day before I'm On a that Venezuela is behind the funding of of this\n[noise] um I had not heard that but ah we're hearing all the time different theories about who might be funding it ... that is interesting it's an interesting theory that Venezuela might be doing it begins Venezuela is broke Venezuela's perhaps a as broke as any country in the region right now\nAnd so that would really be something if they were doing it\n[noise] what do we do if they make it to the border Mike I mean they'll the Univision I think it's Univision is reporting that that number has no fourteen thousand I think that's hard to believe but you know even have five thousand people at the border what do we do\n[noise] it's um difficult to say I hope and pray that it doesn't come to that because\nFirst of all think about what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere near being ready to handle that kind of volume nowhere near ready to be handling the kind of volume that they've already\nGot a and so I I suspect that we will need to um bring out\nA whole lot of additional human resources let's just say in order to make sure that our border isn't completely over run and that it doesn't just become a free for all for people to enter the country unlawfully we have no idea no ability to control who comes in once there is um\n[noise] and that kind of stampede coming in all it was so we've got to protect our borders\nSenator Mike Lee last questions any any comments on um the the multiple pipe bombs that were delivered\nA\nTragic it's frightening I condemn anyone who uh who did it and I condemn anyone who\nSays anything ah to applaud or encourage your support that kind of action uh this is I'm not something we can tolerate in American political discourse\nAnd I look forward to the day we're fighting the perpetrators responsible and I think they should be punished to the maximum extent possible under the law\nYou would classify them a ... let me rephrase that I Would classify whoever did this as terrorists would you classify them as terrorists\nWithout question without question and they need to be punished that such\n... thank you Mike appreciated Senator Mike Lee author of written out of history a great book or if you were looking to learn about the great people and our uh in our country that have passed the people who have been written out of history it's ... it's out now Senator Mike Lee\nAlways ... [noise] I think you know we're not too that a breaking news that you know dramatic [noise] back to [noise] to approve a request for eight hundred US troops to travel to the U.S Mexico border to provide logistical support for border agents or as the caravan approaches\nThat are just happening now expect that to come down at least later on today\nEight hundred troops who think that's the first the first wave that was the what the department of homeland security Nassau requested okay good good [noise]\nAll right I Want to talk to a little bit about liberty safe [noise] um I was um [noise]\nUh watching a video sent to me by a friend last night of a good friend of mine kind of fact guy I just adore um who was really truly an amazing mentor of mine Michael Shea ... when I was a kid um he owns a group of ah the stations down Santa Rosa California\nAnd there's this documentary that they they made and\nIt you know the fire started at like eleven o'clock at night by three o'clock in the morning everything was on fire I mean it's when you watch this it's really we're not getting a sense outside of California you're not really getting a sense of how destructive and how fast\nThis thing was spreading um and um they showed\nThe footage from inside one of the fire trucks that were called from the outside and they weren't familiar with the area and um\nThey said as they were pulling into this area which was supposed to supposed to be safe when they left the firehouse they said go meet us here when they got there it was at Kmart it was the whole k-mart was on fire everything was burned down\nSo they started driving away looking for a safe place like thirty forty minutes into it they're looking in this in the dark and they're seeing for miles what they think are fields that have little fires burning around mhm then they realize that was a\nAround ... then they realize\nThat was a ... those were homes oh my gosh they were holding complexes and they've been burnt entirely to the ground and those little fires are just what's still left burning it's in radical ... um [noise]\nThe things that you you see\nWhat was amazing to me is again if you um\nIf you have any valuables I'm a fan of liberty safe and here's one of the reasons fire\nDestroys everything and if you have a safe and it's not a fire rated safe it's three thousand degrees fires of your house three thousand degrees that your car window when your if your cars parked in the garage\nThe the aluminum wheels melt the aluminum is running down a like it was water it's crazy\nLiberty safe fire rated you can trust it in a hurricane is a trusted in a flood you can trust that when you open it up and we've seen this in California there's nothing left in these homes except the chimney and the liberty safe and they open it up and the things are fine\nIt's really remarkable so no matter what you're protecting\nLiberty safe right now they're having a a Franklin Stein event\nFranklin is one of their biggest their customer favorites uh it's I think that's what I have is the Franklin they're really great a safe you can also look at their exclusive reaper series safes it's all happening right now where they have jewelry cash documents guns prescription medicate whatever it is\nBecome a liberty safe on her best built safe on the planet bar none is liberty safe check out their special deals that liberty safe dot com that liberty safe dot com [noise]", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "25"}
