appealed it really is not good at that no that doesn't seem to look at all I I Want to try to get through or killing the essay for somebody wanted to get drunk first yeah I Know that's how this works [laughter]\nDebate will come out what is it come out though is that a Tuesday or yeah it's a really good at\nWorst war criminals in history Tuesday advance um\nAnd uh what's already sold Seventy five thousand in advance a sales\nAnd you only have that and you only have Seventy one thousand instructor your car which is not yeah I Know and you know the gas is going up it's really you know it's actually a really\nGood book bill really ugly or minutes four minutes or to the vote senator Collins has just voted yes on the advancement she said will announce her final decision at three PM ... again\nI mean because everyone thinks this vote is going to be consistent with the vote that would happen this weekend or are we really thinking that she's going to\nChange that I Know now know show up for the oil or Republicans\nWill vote for Kavanaugh because if they don't they're out of the Republican Party\nWell a lake it's it like and he's already out of it you know he's leaving leaving no that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches\nMaybe write a book if he's got the machine against him that's going to hurt him in retirement as far as good earnings are concerned about where he is\nStill I Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's this is a really important vote and who knows what happened in twelve hours even\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave oh I Will do my daughter's ... did you see my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways to vote 'em but I look you know if your daughter's getting married your daughter's getting married um maybe they could move the\nCeremony later and it could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro ... some odd reason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they can make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right well she's only eat that are on that I thought we are to God that says if you want me to give you so now we got to give it to me that's not an honor killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand evil my mother didn't\nShe lived a very ... and re your life yeah cheese on me which is obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so the writers you didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids or clerics abusing children\nUm Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof this is all evil it centered on evil and so\nI wrote it says with an eye on and explaining to the reader that these concentration camp guards and the people who kill babies and gashed innocent people were farmers are merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this you weren't as Saxons they were regular\nPeople and once the war started they put on that black uniform of the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things that history has ever seen\nThat I think will play out in our politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby that is driving me to thing and the media is like\nWhat ... what was like this is still a brand new but then the second sorry go to Graham\nFor Grassley his\nHair was that I I Believe okay so to mishaps and um\nYou have to understand that the media in conjunction with the fanatics Israel it powerful powerful to drive\nSites and so I only have to hold on to stop\nHold on just your Heller she's a now ... now yes being is a big one district hills and\nMrs Hyde Smith Murkowski commander in Hong\n...\nJohnson is there a gym\nMr Kennedy\nHow's he was a big one is clearly term Mr Kyle\nMr Lankford is truly he certainly\nMr mansion\nMr murky and what did you mentioned this isn't a Casco Murkowski\nMr McConnell\nInstrument into almost there it's the Merkley lot of them ... okay come Iran is Murkowski\nIslands so we do nothing Murphy will know soon wouldn't\nYou know we didn't know on a mansion or Murkowski those are the two very interesting\nAnd is is strange I'm watching all of the networks and none of them are catching the vote so no one is\nYeah north of New York times or we're looking at all the sites right now to see what the nobody knows we don't know yet yeah yeah well that's kind of has\nA you know they're going to the closed debate and I'm an old both tomorrow and I do believe in the cabinet will be confirmed [noise] um nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this and the winds are blowing against\nThe Democrats now the winds have shifted\nElicit being on the other when shifting don't you think I mean this the first time I've ever seen this tactic by the Democrats backfire on them\nI don't know the Clarence Thomas stuff was pretty rough um and I think that\nA African Americans at the time were pretty angry about it\nBut it that of course a dissipated once he got on a court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed more or less all go away we'll people just say okay the good guys one and and we're not\nReal are interested in punishing the Democrats I don't think so anymore I don't think I just think people are so furious I think they're gonna they're gonna take it out on\nThe ... I think the Democrats think that they control these these um activist they really think that they can you know ... you know turn 'em on and turn them off you know I Know they do but I think they're approaching a time when they're not going to be able to turn them off\nA ... I don't see it that way is that there is very well organized you're going to get individuals that confront people in restaurants or ... like that you're going to have that\nAnd somebody might get hurt but on the organized for these people are very disciplined and there's about a dozen organizations now where money is flooding into disrupt the process on the part of the far left\nThan by um there's some news Iraq\nYet with um one thing a couple of things here a Collins\nOne of the big ones are yes ... I'm like so yeah and in the ass so\nI'm I'm sure Murkowski was a yes and mansion I don't know that that's an interesting\nOr in the middle of looking at that right now ah and bill do you think that they just overplayed their hand oh yeah I really like they could have had it they could have had Murkowski they could've had colon if they really played the seriously but instead they overplay their hand to an incredible the worldly\nAbsolutely and they didn't have what they didn't have 'em look I went through this and and all the all of a sudden I Everytime I turned around there was somebody else and the law widely did this\nAnd that wasn't true mhm\nAll right so what they thought would that more people were going to come out and and point a finger at him and and or somebody was going to bolster Ford's party statement going oh yeah I was at that party and I saw this\nHappen where do they have the loop through it out there the less accepted it as fact and made it easier for people to come through and then you add avid ... and all these other crazy people piling on and and the and the left said look this is what usually happens\nBut here um you know with the FBI involvement and you know pretty strong statement by Kavanaugh capital I saved himself you did you know one of the things that I couldn't do in a way to save myself because they didn't want they being far need to address it yes\nUh may I couldn't save myself\nCabin or did you\nUh we had a ... I live with turned it it does look like a rock Joe Manchin has voted yes on\nKavanaugh says that means that having a that mansions gonna vote to confirm him mhm and the reason Manchin is doing that is because if he voted against having all that he might lose the election\nWas that the west Virginia now I Do period\nWe do have one no vote from Lisa Murkowski Murkowski's out a mansion in playing in Collins is in a business would you should be enough for him to get confirmed\nHere because if it's a tie intense breaks it correct Murkowski if Murkowski votes against Kavanaugh she's through in the Republican Party\nShe's finished yeah I won't get a nickel\nI'm from any Republican and I believe that she her Senate career will be over I think the people of Alaska very conservative state will throw her out\nDo you think Joe or do you think a bill that we have with a um with Murkowski the situation where she knew it was going to go through we wanted to vote no was able to vote no because she knew they had the fifty votes\n[noise] doesn't matter just a no vote going against every single one of her\nColleagues mhm\nHer and puts her as a poll\nThe league's mhm isolates her and puts her as a poli a word of the day before I uh\nUh in the Republican Party game that that's an amazing situation I didn't think Murkowski was put her entire career risk ... over this but I'm a chef\nSo she could vote yes demar\nHow how though she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nWell now she voted yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I ... I Am going to vote yes\nMaybe but I uh that's a pretty tough line and\nYeah I don't think he's going to do it but it is interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote results of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots\nAre in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I I don't think so I don't think so\nAnd they are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent uh and we'll wait and see Bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot of

correct math problem the main street the mainstream movies mostly just drive by shootings\n[laughter] you know a a good chunk of the country though I Know that we found out the other day of a\nMajor you know quote unquote bipartisan agreement on opioids the vote was Ninety eight\nTo one in the Senate and the one vote was Mike Lee he was the no\nOn the bill and and mad if that doesn't make me hesitated and wonder what the hell is in their own you know I mean I oh yeah you nervous I mean if Mike Lee is voting no on ... it's not like Mike Lee doesn't drug victims right and I can I just\nSay I'm Sorry pat as a guy who lives in excruciating pain in his whole life\nAs me a guy who has woken up on the operating table they cannot keep me down my body doesn't process that stuff like other people and I woke up in the middle of surgery scared the hell\nOut of the anesthesiologist but\nBut woken up they ... they take it takes ... to keep me down\nSo ah I should do appreciate those drugs so yeah I just did an interview with um [noise]\nOh shoot from the five he's a friend of ours uh bowling ... did the first interview with him about his son and opioids and everything else it's a ... hour full powerful interview\nBut his stance now is those all should be banned that they should not make them at all the old opioid any opioids should be banned should not be even a veil of all to anybody I disagree with that is so wrong yeah it was summer example a ... to live\nIn it it makes life miserable yeah you can you can handle getting through your daily activities otherwise you'd be curled up at a ball and pain somewhere and you don't you'd you'd end up killing your uh usually would horrific yeah yeah\nOr if you if you don't have that I mean it doesn't even it doesn't even negate all the pain it just may not care yeah you just don't carry your skill\nIn pain you just don't care as\nManaging and there does seem to be a legitimate medical use for a lot of people to use opioids in that if you do get a different than you you can get addicted in July or they can't hit you can\nDo your body it's only normal your body gets addicted and it's held to get off of\nIt I don't know about you but my doctors are really ... vigilant oh by the ... oh my gosh they are if they've gotten acts absolutely not see ask about yeah\nI Know you're a doctor 'cause we we have the same back Dr and we were talking about it and I I always bring you up 'cause he's always when I bring you up easily at because I'll always say patties in so much and he's like I think he's one of the worst\nPain patients that I have he's like I I don't know how he does it um and so we always talk about it and he's told me that his his the government is coming down on opioids too hard you know it's like I don't know how people like pat are going to really I mean yeah it's going to be hard it's going to be hard\nAnd they're you know you've got to do drug testing ... almost every time now almost every time you had to make sure you're not doctor shopping I guess in getting drugs from somebody else and you don't have anything in your system but what's supposed to be there almost every time I go I get a drug test seriously ha ha\n... and ... interesting allegation right yeah the idea that different doctors would have different approaches to a particular medical ailment is not surprising right like you would go to a doctor because you think they're treating it better than maybe somebody else no there's no doctor shopping I well that's what the what I'm saying is\nThe search for doctor shopping allegations can sometimes encounter some people\nWho are yeah young something legitimate yeah yeah but there are a lot of people who will go and try to get you know whatever they can from somebody or their their pernicious drugs but it's like anything is the Internet bad no right it can be it\nCan be are are these opioids bad you know be it can be I mean it's it's like anything with real power\nAnd in the hands of each human you have the choice you can use them to alleviate pain or you can use them the way they're not supposed to be used and it's a very hard thing but you just got to be rock solid and it it it is hard it's really hard\nYeah but banning them is a it just is not a good idea of just it's again prohibition yeah the drug war and that and not the way you deal with it [noise]\nWhy am I doing over you and stuff show right down to that working out here ago they had a you have a lot of beer that functional really yeah I felt like I don't know what I'm saying anymore really serious it is clear I Would totally done any he seems totally ground would not do it all down by the hour we'll\nI can drink more on the air which may mean question I've ever seen a lot less
